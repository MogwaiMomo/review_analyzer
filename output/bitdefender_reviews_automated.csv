Michael Lobo,1,5,Independent reviews have consistently rated BitDefender Total Security. It was easy to install and seems to work efficiently / effectively. I will give credit to the Support Team who are relatively prompt replying and I have always had a reply to questions especially to follow-up issues for my clarification.
David Fine,1,5,"I would like to say Bitdefender has legitimately saved my PC today. My Nvidia GTX 1650 had a driver update, and it wasn't going right. The screen went black and then ended up saying no signal. My PC then actually reboot and after a bit of loading I got a black screen that said ""Your security solution is cleaning your device from threats. The cleaning process finished successfully!"" Bitdefender has served me for so long and has protected and optimized my PC so many times. I have never had a situation like this that Bitdefender saved my PC from a bad driver. I would like to thank all the developers at Bitdefender for creating such amazing software that I have been using for years now. Thank you so much for saving me so much time and effort it would have took to fix my PC because of one bad driver. You are the best guys. ❤️Bitdefender"
Zsuzsa,1,4,Fast and polite customer service and support. Having dealt with my issues in a highly professional manner. I was looking for security. I got security. They provide what they stand for. Highly reccomended to everyone.Thank you for the support received.
Cristi,17,1,I've bought a licence which I haven't use for few months to notice now when activate that it is less than 365days.A complete ripoff!What if you buy a licence as a gift to someone and find out that is less then a year!!
David LaFrance,1,5,"Required help to merge two subscriptions I discovered I had accidentally somehow managed to acquire. The rep was able to merge them so I did not need to move or change any devices licensing and also combined the subscription time as well that was a pleasant surprise as they were both expiring in less than a month. The rep was fast, very nice and helpful."
Brad N,1,5,Prior ro purchase I called customer service to see how long it took to talk to a human being.  Less than 2-minutes.After purchase and installation I needed help from customer service.  With in minute the representative had me on the road.  Good Stuff!
Veska Dudina,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender Total Security for the second year in a row and so far I have not had a breakdown of my computer and mobile devices.
"Lorenzo,",1,1,"…After a week and over a DOZEN emails, they could not resolve my problem, even thou I have been using their product for 12 years and counting. I decided to move on. I want to note that I would not have stayed this long with them if they acted like they have. Every time I would send in an email I would be dealing with another rep and had to repeat myself over and over.So I deleted it and went with someone else and when my other licenses expire I will do the same.PS: THIS COMPANY USED TO THE BEST...TO BAD."
Andy McArthur,7,4,"Purchase of Bitdefender.I purchased Bitdefender during a weekend. I anticipated receiving an e-mail with the Activation Code early on the Monday after.When it had not arrived by mid-afternoon I telephoned the Support Line and enquired about the Activation Code. First call dropped out, second call held up and following the conversation the Activation Code was e-mailed to me.I received two e-mails with the Activation Code. The first was sent by the operator of the call which dropped out and the second stemmed from the second call.The Bitdefender Support Staff were very polite and helpful at all times.I would recommend Bitdefender but caution that if it is a renewal do so in plenty of time avoiding weekend transactions. The payment for the service must reach the company and weekend delays may occur"
Denis Massicotte,1,5,"This is where i have to say again that Bitdefender,not only they have good products,but they have the best customer service either by,email or fb and even over the phone so,Keep it up!"
Aurelia Asan,1,5,"Safety and quick involvement from the team, to solve any problems."
Carl Rice,2,5,BD is the best Antivirus software available.  Simple to maintain and tech support is the best in the business.  I've never had a problem that wasn't swiftly resolved in the most pleasant way.  Thanks for a superb product.
H.J.M.C. L'Ortye,9,5,"Bitdefender is an excellent anti virus program, it keeps me safe. With Bitdefender my pc and tablet work without a hitch, Kaspersky caused all sorts of irritating problems like sudden restarts, my tablet ""froze""every half hour and, most of all the combination with a VPN program caused such a loss in speed that is was not practical anymore. Bitdefender with premium VPN is a big relief. Almost no reduction in speed, it works like a dream. Installation is easy and the price for this top rated product is very competitive. I am a very happy customer."
Dailey,4,5,I was completely satisfied with the support that I receive from Bitdefender.  They are the best par non.
James G. Vigent,6,4,"I've already explained my chagrin over an email received today that declared my Bitdefender protection expired on 29 Jan 2021 and not correctly on May 18, 2021."
Chrissie M,3,5,I have used various products and Bitdefender has consistently been the most reliable and user friendly. I can manage the security of the whole family and the price is very reasonable
SmallInvestor,14,5,I like this internet security product. It really saves my computer and my money. A great choice for the user thank you BitDefender
jesiel andal,1,5,
Jendayi,1,3,"Bitdefender seems like a good product for the most part. It is definitely a higher-end product that will deliver what it promises. My one complaint is the price you pay for it. There is the free version which probably gives you the very base protection. The paid version gives you a more enhanced experience. Unfortunately, if you want any other features like anti-malware and spyware protection, VPN protection, and utilities that will run diagnoses on your computer to keep it running to its top performance the expense can run high. Just be mindful. Capitalism at its finest."
Henning,8,5,"Had problems with my C Drive and had to clean my hard drive completely. When rebuilding the hard drive I needed some information from Bitdefender, I called Bitdefender and 5 minutes later I was reinstalling. I have been using Bitdefender for the last 2 1/2 years and not once had any issues with viruses - malware and such. And when we need Bitdefender’s  they are there with an excellence service."

David LaFrance,1,5,"Required help to merge two subscriptions I discovered I had accidentally somehow managed to acquire. The rep was able to merge them so I did not need to move or change any devices licensing and also combined the subscription time as well that was a pleasant surprise as they were both expiring in less than a month. The rep was fast, very nice and helpful."
Brad N,1,5,Prior ro purchase I called customer service to see how long it took to talk to a human being.  Less than 2-minutes.After purchase and installation I needed help from customer service.  With in minute the representative had me on the road.  Good Stuff!

Andy McArthur,7,4,"Purchase of Bitdefender.I purchased Bitdefender during a weekend.

Carl Rice,2,5,BD is the best Antivirus software available.  Simple to maintain and tech support is the best in the business.  I've never had a problem that wasn't swiftly resolved in the most pleasant way.  Thanks for a superb product.
H.J.M.C. L'Ortye,9,5,"Bitdefender is an excellent anti virus program, it keeps me safe. With Bitdefender my pc and tablet work without a hitch, Kaspersky caused all sorts of irritating problems like sudden restarts, my tablet ""froze""every half hour and, most of all the combination with a VPN program caused such a loss in speed that is was not practical anymore. Bitdefender with premium VPN is a big relief. Almost no reduction in speed, it works like a dream. Installation is easy and the price for this top rated product is very competitive. I am a very happy customer."

Jendayi,1,3,"Bitdefender seems like a good product for the most part. It is definitely a higher-end product that will deliver what it promises. My one complaint is the price you pay for it. There is the free version which probably gives you the very base protection. The paid version gives you a more enhanced experience. Unfortunately, if you want any other features like anti-malware and spyware protection, VPN protection, and utilities that will run diagnoses on your computer to keep it running to its top performance the expense can run high. Just be mindful. Capitalism at its finest."

With Bitdefender my pc and tablet work without a hitch, Kaspersky caused all sorts of irritating problems like sudden restarts, my tablet ""froze""every half hour and, most of all the combination with a VPN program caused such a loss in speed that is was not practical anymore. Bitdefender with premium VPN is a big relief. Almost no reduction in speed, it works like a dream. Installation is easy and the price for this top rated product is very competitive.

Jendayi,1,3,"Bitdefender seems like a good product for the most part. It is definitely a higher-end product that will deliver what it promises. My one complaint is the price you pay for it. There is the free version which probably gives you the very base protection. The paid version gives you a more enhanced experience. Unfortunately, if you want any other features like anti-malware and spyware protection, VPN protection, and utilities that will run diagnoses on your computer to keep it running to its top performance the expense can run high. Just be mindful. Capitalism at its finest."

Carl Rice,2,5,BD is the best Antivirus software available.  Simple to maintain and tech support is the best in the business.  I've never had a problem that wasn't swiftly resolved in the most pleasant way.  Thanks for a superb product.
H.J.M.C. L'Ortye,9,5,"Bitdefender is an excellent anti virus program, it keeps me safe. With Bitdefender my pc and tablet work without a hitch, Kaspersky caused all sorts of irritating problems like sudden restarts, my tablet ""froze""every half hour and, most of all the combination with a VPN program caused such a loss in speed that is was not practical anymore. Bitdefender with premium VPN is a big relief. Almost no reduction in speed, it works like a dream. Installation is easy and the price for this top rated product is very competitive. I am a very happy customer."

Jendayi,1,3,"Bitdefender seems like a good product for the most part. It is definitely a higher-end product that will deliver what it promises. My one complaint is the price you pay for it. There is the free version which probably gives you the very base protection. The paid version gives you a more enhanced experience. Unfortunately, if you want any other features like anti-malware and spyware protection, VPN protection, and utilities that will run diagnoses on your computer to keep it running to its top performance the expense can run high. Just be mindful. Capitalism at its finest."

Carl Rice,2,5,BD is the best Antivirus software available.  Simple to maintain and tech support is the best in the business.  I've never had a problem that wasn't swiftly resolved in the most pleasant way.  Thanks for a superb product.
H.J.M.C. L'Ortye,9,5,"Bitdefender is an excellent anti virus program, it keeps me safe. With Bitdefender my pc and tablet work without a hitch, Kaspersky caused all sorts of irritating problems like sudden restarts, my tablet ""froze""every half hour and, most of all the combination with a VPN program caused such a loss in speed that is was not practical anymore. Bitdefender with premium VPN is a big relief. Almost no reduction in speed, it works like a dream. Installation is easy and the price for this top rated product is very competitive. I am a very happy customer."

Jendayi,1,3,"Bitdefender seems like a good product for the most part. It is definitely a higher-end product that will deliver what it promises. My one complaint is the price you pay for it. There is the free version which probably gives you the very base protection. The paid version gives you a more enhanced experience. Unfortunately, if you want any other features like anti-malware and spyware protection, VPN protection, and utilities that will run diagnoses on your computer to keep it running to its top performance the expense can run high. Just be mindful. Capitalism at its finest."

Michael Lobo,1,5,Independent reviews have consistently rated BitDefender Total Security. It was easy to install and seems to work efficiently / effectively. I will give credit to the Support Team who are relatively prompt replying and I have always had a reply to questions especially to follow-up issues for my clarification.
David Fine,1,5,"I would like to say Bitdefender has legitimately saved my PC today. My Nvidia GTX 1650 had a driver update, and it wasn't going right. The screen went black and then ended up saying no signal. My PC then actually reboot and after a bit of loading I got a black screen that said ""Your security solution is cleaning your device from threats. The cleaning process finished successfully!"" Bitdefender has served me for so long and has protected and optimized my PC so many times. I have never had a situation like this that Bitdefender saved my PC from a bad driver. I would like to thank all the developers at Bitdefender for creating such amazing software that I have been using for years now. Thank you so much for saving me so much time and effort it would have took to fix my PC because of one bad driver. You are the best guys. ❤️Bitdefender"

David LaFrance,1,5,"Required help to merge two subscriptions I discovered I had accidentally somehow managed to acquire. The rep was able to merge them so I did not need to move or change any devices licensing and also combined the subscription time as well that was a pleasant surprise as they were both expiring in less than a month. The rep was fast, very nice and helpful."

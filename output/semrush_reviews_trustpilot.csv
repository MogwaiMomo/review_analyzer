Frank Roemisch,2,5,Very helpful for all my SEO tasks. Really awesome for content ideas too.
Andrew Shotland,1,5,"Our agency uses SEMRush as one of our core SEO data tools. It's a great resource for aggregating a lot of data and making sense of it. There are numerous great use cases for us. Off the top of my head:1. Quick research for prospective clients to get an understanding of how their current SEO program is doing2. Identifying client competitors in Google and quickly getting an understanding of their SEO tactics using the Keyword Gap and Domain Overview tools. I particularly like to use the Pages feature to get an understanding of which content on a competitor site is doing well.3. Quick keyword research with the Keyword Magic tool to get an understanding of the keywords and questions surrounding a topic.4. We have also built a number of internal tools based on SEMRush's API, so we really believe in this tool.If you are running an SEO program SEMRush is basically a swiss army knife for SEO."
Maryna Nalyvaiko,5,5,The tools and the team rock. I requested a feature in their community and they made it live not long after. A striking example how a company truly listen to their customers.
Alok Kumar,1,4,"I like the content template and keyword tools, but the price could be lower… Still enjoying my subscription a lot!"
Sneh Choudhary,1,5,I absolutely love the SEMRush Writing Assistant. It is such a crucial tool for on-page optimisation. I also like the Backlink Audit - the process of uploading toxic domains and filtering them was so easy. Can’t wait to try more of the platform’s features!
Jeremias de Isequilla,1,5,"Using Semrush for over a year now and can’t imagine how I did without it. The tools help to track my ranks, find keywords, discover link prospects and do reports for the board. Nice work, team!"
Agustín Peña,1,5,"Finally found the perfect tool for SEO audits :) Improved my site health to 95% with all the suggestions, which I guess is the best it’s ever been."
Léonie Bernard,2,5,Gives very helpful insight to grow my online presence.
Phillip,2,5,"I'm in love with the SEO Writing Assistant tool – it helps me a lot with writing content for my website. I'm not very familiar with keyword research and building SEO-strategy for my website content, but since I started updating old content using the SEO Writing Assistant and Keyword Magic Tool – my blog posts started to go up in search results."
Sanjit,3,5,"SEMrush has a plethora of tools from keyword research, keyword manager, rank tracking, backlink and keyword gap analysis, SEO auudit, directory listing management (fairly new), social media and PPC management. It also has a very visually pleasing interface with great manual and automated reporting too!"
Emer,1,5,SEMrush academy has changed my COVID redundancy life and has made me feel like I am bettering myself daily. I am so grateful for all the free resources available!
Elia Malmsten,4,1,"Free trial? They hide away the cancel subscription so deep in the menu it's almost impossible to find - and oh, you have to ""contact"" them to cancel the subscription, so no easy click to cancel it here."
Ash Suresh,1,5,Awesome tool and fantastic team. I’ve learnt so much as part of setting up a new SEO practice and can’t thank Semrush enough. First 2 paying clients signed up now almost exclusively on the back of Semrush strengths! Exciting times ahead. Thanks Semrush team
Mert Erkal,2,5,"This is my 10th year in digital marketing. During this period, I had the opportunity to use many tools. I haven't seen any other tool that contributes as much to our routine SEO and digital marketing efforts as SEMRUSH. Moreover, they constantly update themselves and adapt to trends. I highly recommend it to digital marketing professionals."
Noble Cyril,1,4,"If it wasn't for SEMRush, getting easily relatable analytics and data for my blog would be even more difficult.I like how easy it is to understand every aspect of the data they return for my blog.I am sticking with SEMRush for the nearest possible number of years!"
Manos Filippou,1,5,"It is not a coincidence that when you go to interviews for SEO and digital marketing jobs, they always ask you ""What do you know about SEMrush"", and ""How well do you know to use their tools?"". SEMrush is an industry leader with fantastic tools to manage your everyday digital tasks and make your life much easier.Their tools meet requirements above and beyond expectations, they are easy to use, setup, and manage and their support is exceptional.If you ask me what I love the most about SEMrush, I would probably surprise you, and say hands down ""their people"". I teach two SEO courses on Udemy, and a while ago I contacted them and I asked them if they would like to share their digital insights with my students. They were extremely generous with their time and we developed a fantastic event that I'm sure will benefit a lot of people. I was impressed with their true passion for digital marketing, and their dedication to seeing people succeed. Above all, they are very nice people and it was a pleasure collaborating with them! I'm very, very impressed! I need to also mention that at the time I reached SEMrush I contacted one more company very well known in the industry. They didn't even bother to acknowledge my message, and I never received a reply...SEMrush has a lot of fantastic tools, and each tool serves different purposes. Their SEO audit tool is great with a lot of valuable insights, and I love using their ""Keyword Magic Tool"". There is definitely a little magic happening there. This is a super easy keyword research tool that provides key information such as ""keyword difficult"", ""volume"", and ""competitive density"", and helps make strategic decisions on where to focus when you develop an SEO or PPC campaign. When you do competitive research their ""Backlink Gap"" tool is also great, as you can search by ""Root Domain"", ""Subdomain"", and ""URL"". I find the ""URL"" search very helpful especially if you have specific pages you want to rank higher.There are many great tools in their digital marketing suite, however, there is one tool that I was really impressed when I first used it. I actually thought ""WOW! This tool is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!"". I'm referring to their ""Content Marketing Toolkit."" We all know that content is the King (or the Queen, if you are a lady), and this tool is very powerful. You can research any topic, and you can get content ideas, based on search volume, that you may have never considered before. As an example, when I researched the topic ""immune system"", the first subtopic that came up with high searches was ""lymph nodes"". I didn't even consider researching ""lymph nodes"" as a sub-topic before, and this created a new opportunity.Once you get a list of sub-topics, then you can dig deeper into each sub-topic and get important information such as volume, difficulty, and efficiency. For each sub-topic, you can see a list of ""Headlines"" which are the pages that have the highest resonance with the audience for that specific topic. The best part is that you can also see the number of backlinks for each Headline.When you know what Headlines work, and when you know how many backlinks each Headline has, it is easier to develop a strategy and a plan of action. Overall this is a great tool that has too many benefits to mention here.I would recommend SEMrush to anyone who is serious about digital marketing and wants to make strategic decisions based on data. Their all-in-one digital marketing suite will meet most of your digital needs and is a must-have!"
Terry P. Verduin,2,5,"The importance of SEMrush tools and team expertise cannot be understated. Working with SEMrush is a learning experience. I spent a year with them, then had to drop out for financial reasons. Immediately, my sites started dropping in rankings. SEMrush continued to send valuable reports. I will rejoin this team, soon. They are indispensable. Thank YOU."
Mark Jackson,1,5,SEMRush is an essential marketing tool for the modern age. Search engine marketing is not going anywhere and is a necessity for any business looking to drive traffic to a website. SEMRush is the most comprehensive tool out there to date. Highly recommend it!
Aude-Line Picard,1,5,
Itamar Blauer,1,5,"SEMrush is a must-have tool for marketers. With over 40 different features, I've found plenty of ways to help improve my content with SEMrush.The team behind the scenes do a fantastic job, and I'm grateful to have met and been involved with many of SEMrush's many activities to help the wider community, including regular Twitter chats and their active Facebook community group.Kudos to everyone at SEMrush - I highly recommend getting this piece of SaaS greatness!"
Vullkan Gacaferri,2,5,"The customer service is just excellent. In the midst of stress and pressure, they just help you out. The satisfaction of knowing that in such situation the semrush support will make the impossible to retrieve your data is priceless."
Rachel,2,5,"SEMrush is indeed the cream of the crop for marketing platforms. Their free academy of courses was so helpful with mastering my skill set. I've had a steady climb with the progress that I've made with SEO for websites that I work on and it's all thanks to SEMrush. Also, their content marketing feature is second to none!"
Anthony Gaenzle,1,5,"This is by far the most valuable, impactful SEO tool on the market. I've used SEMrush for my own site, and I often recommend it for clients. So many valuable tools in one platform!"
Manoj One,4,5,"I have used many SEO tools for the past few years. SEMrush is the best among them. It really rocks. From keyword research to backlink analysis to marketing, it helped me in many ways. I like all SEMrush features especially SEO audit and backlink analysis. Auditing helped me to detect several website-related issues. I contacted their customer support for clarifications and they cleared all my doubts through follow-up emails. Fixing issues and optimizing content, helped me to divert more traffic from search results. Still, I have to explore several features on SEMrush. I am excited to use it. It is a great tool for businesses, bloggers, and others to get more love from Google."
Rob Watts,3,5,It’s a great product. In the hands of the skilled or the novice. Look at your market and your competitors and make informed decisions.
Ronald Laid,5,5,The site has a free course. I learned about SEO and backlinking from their free courses. It is a great site.
Brian T,4,4,"Updated 12/21: Service improved this month. Still not happy with previous responses, but I said I would update my review if the service improves, so upping from 1 star to 4.Updated Again 12/1/2020: SEMRush responded mentioning my ""alleged issue."" This is not a unique issue. As far as the ""you don't have to use our services,"" comment, I get you don't understand how insulting that is, that in my eyes you are saying ""get lost if you don't like our software,"" rather than addressing the complaints & issues presented. I will look for an alternative, however, your company knows very well that clients get accustomed to certain reports, etc, which your tool provides, so it's not simply the same thing as switching to a new tool. This has to be researched & it needs to be a transition. I also never said I was leaving your tool, I simply addressed my issues with the bugs & other things I have experienced. In response, I feel that you are being dismissive & defensive, & while you have deleted some of the extremely defensive statements mentioned below, you still seem to have the same overall attitude towards my complaint. I was looking to resolve this & I will resolve this directly, but I have tried resolving issues as explained below, & I don't feel that your company takes responsibility for shortcomings, as demonstrated in your responses. So, I felt it necessary to make sure that I let others know of my experiences. Should my experience improve, I will gladly update my review.Updated: In my opinion, they seem to focus more on growth & getting new customers, than creating something that works well consistently. In my experience, once you start adding customers to their system, some of their existing tools seem to have bugs. In fact, whenever they have a new feature, e.g. an new tool that is an upsell, all of a sudden their reports tools seem to add new bugs. That's not to say those things are on purpose (never implied that), it's to say that I believe time was put in to add new features, meanwhile, other important features were not always working as they should. Overall, I like SEMRush, I do feel it provides value, & I have appreciated some of the time savings I have had using this service, so with that, I have increased this by 1 star. HOWEVER, I have spent far more time fixing issues or waiting for the service to work at times when I needed it to function the most; so that is where my frustration stems from. Ultimately, I just want to be able to rely on the tool to function consistently, & though it does function 90% of the time, that 10% of the time where I have had bugs, or have had to adjust their reports which were not formatting correctly, has created enough of a time waste that I feel that any benefit to using the software was a wash considering the impact of those bugs, etc. Update: I'm not sure why the company decided to respond with extreme defensiveness rather than being helpful. When someone is paying you $$$ for a tool, & some of those main functions don't seem to work, why would we not be frustrated as customers if we're not able to use the software when needed? The point is, if a client asks for a report, & I can't simply provide that report because of bugs, how would you expect a customer not to be frustrated? I have reached out, I have had some of these issues addressed, after complaining about them for almost a year, & even then it took over a month for those issues to be fixed. I'm the one who has invested $$$ in your tool, yet you feel it's appropriate to get defensive with me because your tool has not worked consistently for me? I just want the features to work consistently, & I want to see that you are working on improving existing features. Furthermore, I didn't understand this comment, since I said nothing of the sort in my review: ""your allegation that we disable tools for existing users on purpose is absurd & technically impossible."" I don't even understand how you would interpret any of my comments to mean such a thing. You are either mixing up my review with someone else's, or you were so defensive you didn't even stop to think of how a customer who is paying $$$ per year might be frustrated when their customers are frustrated because they can't provide reports because your tool is buggy & doesn't consistently work. I was never implying, what I said is that there seems to be a focus on adding new features, meanwhile, I can't even access some of the basic functions & I'm having problems getting something to work & when I report it to support, they seem to blame my browser, including multiple different computers & different browsers that I am using. There's no reason for a company to respond to a customer like that."
Sheela,1,5,
Lassi Eronen,3,3,"An okay tool for SEO and SEM, but misleading pricing. A practical example: Emails from sales people as well as the pricing page tell you that Guru plan includes Historical data. After upgrade to Guru plan, it turns out you need to add another 200 USD per month add-on to get historical data in several modules, which happens to be the historical data that is actually useful. This is very misleading and disappointing if you have signed a long contract and it turns out that your costly upgrade does not actually give you any concrete extra value - only some made up value in the form of running more reports (who needs 5000 reports when you can't access data).My experience is that Semrush is ok, but virtually every tool that gives you actually actionable value, is hidden and requires an upgrade to the highest level, with all the add-ons activated."
Ahmad S Johar,1,5,
Jim Brodo,1,5,SEM Rush is a great tool. Cant do my job without it
Ian Cleary,1,5,We have delivered many website/SEO audits and one of the main tools we use is SEMRush.  One of the reasons we are doing so many audits is because using SEMRush we identify so many issues that have an impact on traffic and when these are resolved our clients see traffic going up.  One of the many tools we love within SEMRush is the keyword gap analysis.  We pick off our clients top competitors and produce a long list of keywords their competitors are ranking for that they are not.  This is a great way of identifying great opportunities for traffic.
Aimee Ravelo,1,5,"What I loved about SEMrush's SEO toolkit is how comprehensive & how easy to use it was. I'm a total beginner to SEO and navigating a tool like SEMrush's was easy. Not only that, there are so many useful features the tool offered which really helped me in my projects as a content writer. This is definitely worth purchasing."
Boris Gefter,4,2,"This review is about the SEM Rush marketplace.They promised a 10 day turn around, it was in fact over 30 days. The brief was not followed, and the article written was so amaturish, it is embarassing.Do not use this service.Edit to original review:I now have a refund which upgrades this from a 1 star rating to a 2 star rating. However, the article and service received up to this point was absolutely shocking and I would still advise people to never use the SemRush marketplace service. Stick to what you know SemRush - your SEO tool is fine, anything else is not your area.Edit 2:The team claimed that it did not take 30 days. Ok the order started on the 11 th of October and was delivered on the 4th of November the first time (terribly). So it took 24 days. I don't remember seeing that it was 'business days' but I may have missed that.The file was accessible the entire time and the request was to edit it for some reason instead of just viewing it, and the request came really late too.The bottom line is that even with access to the video file for the brief, it was not followed. And the article looks like it was written by a 14 year old (English as a second language) - they also tried to stuff back links into it for their other clients.Seriously guys give this a miss."
Courtland Lewis,1,5,SEMrush is the site that will be and should be required to perform proper digital marketing work. Of course there are a number of free tools however this beats them all. If you want to have a leg up or on a equal playing field with your competitors? Then this is the tool you need.
Reza Ghezel,1,5,"Hi good people in SEMrush. I love you guys and really thanks for such a great tool, great academy, and great blog. Firs of all I should mention that SEMrush free tool however restricted is a good idea. It help learners to experiment their SEO knowledge practically. Personally i utilized this feature to nurture my skills. Besides it will encourage people too buy this awesome product. Because what is experimented is more trusted. Another subject that I'm wiling to talk, is about academy courses. I'm passing technical SEO course and i think it's great too, but it could be better. To improving these kind of courses i recommend to talk about that specific topic more in depth. For example in this awesome course academy has talked about sitemaps but it doesn't talk about how to implement them. Actually I just use this learning to get aware of keywords in that topic and then i search them in google and use another sources like google support or google developers guidelines. I know that academy has not enough room to talk about every single topic in its courses but i think prioritizing them could be very useful. In my opinion definition of a specific concept and how to implement it are the most important things in a course like technical SEO and the latter thing is absent in academy courses."
Gabriella Sannino,1,5,"We've been using SEMRush for years for ourselves and our clients. Each update makes it a more robust platform, as well as a more helpful partner platform to manage our websites. What I like most about SEMRush overall is that it's not just about optimization and ranking - although that's a part of it. It's grown to be an overall website tracker.Need keyword ideas? No problem. Looking for keyword gaps in comparison to the competition? SEMRush has that, too. Keep track of your advertising (and the competitor's); create, post and track your social media. Build custom reports that show your clients just what they're interested in.But what I really like most in terms of specific tools is the content marketing platform and all that entails. It can be easy to go off the rails when building websites and providing content expansion. SEMRush helps the whole process, from topic research to revisions and improvements, landing page comparison to competitors... and now they've hooked up with Yoast SEO, which we also love, to provide keyword suggestions (with data to back them up) within our websites.Our SEO team is kind of old school - we always add that human element - but SEMRush is definitely a top product to support our services. If we had to have an SEO bug out bag, SEMRush would be in it!"
Jessica Foster,1,5,"As an SEO content strategist, I use SEMrush to inform my clients’ content strategy, keyword targeting, and on-page SEO. I’ve found no better tool when it comes to dissecting a competitor’s keyword strategy and finding new opportunities for my clients. I’ve also found the SEO Content Template to be particularly helpful when it comes to optimizing content according to what’s working for the top-ranking pages for my target keywords. I recommend SEMrush to all of my clients and content writers who are looking for a premium, data-driven SEO tool."
Aaron Dicks,1,5,"At Impression we've been huge fans of SEMRush for some time. Most recently we've been using the powerful Competitive Intelligence toolkit, as well as our own research and insights, to help our clients better understand their cross channel market performance. The conversations to come from this have been really enlightening and they have been commercially rewarding too."
Jigar Agrawal,1,5,SEMRush Social Media Toolkit is the best in the business. You always trust SEMrush to come up with something special every time and the same is the case with the social media toolkit. I'm using this tool to great effect and it has helped to increase my visibility on Social Media. Kudos to the entire team of SEMRush.Highly recommended.!
JL Faverio,1,5,"Nothing beats SEMrush Marketplace when it comes to time, cost and quality content writing. 99% of articles we purchased for our Bay Area clients have required zero revisions, which by itself is a timesaver. But my personal favorite SEO tool is the Site Audit and the beautiful reports it produces. They help clients visualize what's wrong with their website, and explain how to make fixes in plain English as opposed to geek-speak."
Kevin Maguire,1,5,"What more can I say about SEMRush, other than it's a must have optimisation and research tool for any SEO specialist. 1st in class platform with 1st in class data."
Jeff Kryger,2,5,"This tool has a lot to offer and the team got a lot of value out of it! A few thoughts include:- It has some functionality that is superior to Moz like some really tangible and actionable content, semantics, and backlinks recommendations. They are really helpful for spurring ideas and recommendations and is really amazing for research.- There also seems to be a more informative connector to Google Analytics which is always a bonus for actual data interpretation."
Aleks Shklyar,1,5,"My absolute favorite tool to use for SEO is SEMRush. While originally the tool was the go to for keyword research (it tracks keyword ranks and models traffic for those keywords), today it’s much much more. Some awesome features of the tool include:– Backlink audits to see if there are links you need to disavow– SEO audits that show technical issues that need to be reviewed and fixed– Keyword magic tool that will help you brainstorm keyword ideas– Competitor overview based on keyword overlap– Position tracking over time that does not require setting up– SEMRush sensor to track SERP volatility and predict big Google algorithm updates by topic– Logfile analyzer– Many more features outside of SEO and also new SEO features currently in alpha testingTo say SEMRush gives you everything you need to maintain your site for SEO is an understatement. Though you will not get the same level of granularity as specialty tools like Ahrefs or STAT, you get a little bit of everything. Overall, I recommend any company or SEO add SEMRush to their toolset if they haven’t already. I expect even more great features in the near future from them that are guaranteed to make waves through the SEO world and earn them, even more, industry credit."
Chris Perez,1,5,"Thank you so much for working with our students at the McGraw School of Business!  You were gracious to provide access to your platform and support the students in our Digital Marketing course.  SEMrush is an excellent tool that I make all of my marketing majors aware of to use in their careers. Chris Perez, Assistant Professor, McGraw School of Business at Olivet Nazarene University"
Sugandha Bansal,1,5,"SEMrush is truly an all-in-one digital marketing platform. It works as my right hand for my Search Engine Optimization and Content Marketing Strategy. I have used 10+ marketing tools for a different set of requirements but I have observed tremendous and significant success in the marketing campaigns after using SEMrush. Exploring features in ""Topic Research Tool"" has been on top of my head to get an excellent idea to start with content creation! Specially Keyword research, competitive analysis, backlink analysis and marketing calendar have been my favorite tools that has reduced my efforts and time with spectacular results."
KV,2,1,Still waiting for SEMrush team to come back and help with my subscription issue. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE SORT OUT MY ISSUE???
Ankitaa GD,1,5,"I have been using SEMrush for many years now, and the best part of using SEMrush is how simple and easy it is to use. It's not just one single tool for SEO. There are lots more to work with. I can find the right keywords to target, detect the keyword gaps, and even make sure I am using keywords in the right manner with the SEO Writing Assistant!And the project information that I can extract just by adding domains is incredible. I have my own website added as a project, and I also keep track of my client websites - SEO, social media, brand monitoring, link building, content analyzer, and more. While my focus is organic marketing, I have used the PPC Keyword Tool and Ad Builder tools to create ads for my clients. And those ads not only fit the client brief, but also have returned great results. All in all, SEMrush is my go-to tool whenever I take up a new digital marketing project. I can't imagine what all I would have to do if I didn't have SEMrush just a click away at work!"
Anonymous,2,5,I love using SEMrush. Semrush has help us to increase our organic traffic and stay with our bigger competitors. It a really useful tool to find out where you can make improvement to your website to better your traffic and SEO.
David Sayce,1,5,"I've been a paying customer of SEMrush for about 5 years, and without a doubt, it is my go-to tools for my digital marketing business. It is also one of a handful of tools I regularly recommend to clients and other businesses. The toolset is continually growing and evolving, you never feel left behind or that you are not using the most up to date information available. And just to top it all off the people behind the business add to an already exceptional experience!Check out the webinars and try one of the free trials available. Highly recommended!"
Tanya Bansal,1,5,"SEMrush is MY go-to tool!Whenever I have to run a detailed SEO, competitors and keyword report, I have to look nowhere but just this one platform which is super easy to use and I love the fact how I can customize my own reports using whatever segments I want to choose. I also like SEMrush's writing assistance tool that I use while writing SEO-friendly content and their keyword mapping tool which provided me tons of ideas for my clients. I have always suggested this tool to my friends in the digital industry and my team members too. In fact, I trained my coworkers in my former company on how to use SEMrush and run SEO reports. They are still a fan of this tool, and so am I :)"
Linh Pham,2,4,"Excellent platform for all digital marketing needs. I especially enjoy the competitive research and topic research features. The only drawback would be its pricing model, can be quite expensive if you need multiple accounts."
Stefania Borchia,1,5,An excellent tool to guide you through the intricate world of SEO.
Dan Callis,1,5,SEMrush is my go-to tools for keyword and competitor data. I'm a dedicated freelance technical SEO and I wouldn't be able to do my job without it!
Neel Vithlani,1,5,"SEMrush is an awesome tool for SEOs and one of the major differentiators for this brand is its active participation among the community. The tool is comprehensive yet easy to use, making it a grat choice for digital marketing activities. It is great for analyzing competition as well as content planning. Combining this with audit reports, SEMrush is one of the best offerings in the market. They also regularly publish educational material.Love and regards, Neel."
Kelley Pernicone,1,5,"SEMrush is an extremely valuable tool that every SEO should have at their fingertips! It's also an excellent audit tool for organizations to see the impact their online presence has. Not only can you see your current data and performance, you can see some historical data for comparison. You are able to see what your competitors are doing which is useful, especially in niche industries. But my favorite is the site health/audit report. It lets me know quickly if there is a technical issue with our website and gives me clear steps to take to fix (while also explaining the importance). If you are responsible for your company's webpage, you need this tool."
Zamfir Andreea,2,5,"I've started using SEMrush ever since I started doing SEO and I consider it the best on the market. It analyses the websites in depth, more in depth than other SEO tools. With its help, I brought millions of traffic to my clients and I couldn't thank more its team! I cannot think of the best feature of this app as all of them are totally amazing. Thank you for the Website's Health Analysis, thank you for the On Page Grader, for the Traffic Analysis; basically, thanks for inventing this tool, which has taught me so many things regarding SEO!"
Shehroz zaman,2,5,"I have been this for almost more than 3 years it has been great experience by using Semrush all features, and looking forward to have more new features in near future"
Skyler Reeves,3,5,"We currently use SEMrush as a key tool in our marketing agency. I’ll a run-through some of the pros and cons of our use cases:🟩 Pro’s 🟩✅ Keyword Research & ClusteringUseful for keyword research, especially the keyword magic tool and ability to segment keywords into “buckets.” This bucketing feature is very handy when you’re trying to plan out topic clusters and need to group things together. Keyword clustering is something that another tool we use, Ahrefs, is unable to do. ✅ Topic Research Tool (Topic Ideation)I’ll admit, I just used this feature for the first time last night and now I’m kicking myself for not diving deeper into this platform to see what all it can do. This feature is the primary thing that prompted me to leave this review. So here’s how it works: you drop a keyword or topic in, and it spits back out dozens and dozens of topics that you can expand to see relevant titles for. This is a lifesaver for folks like me who can write about any topic you throw at me but are absolutely paralyzed when asked to generate an idea/angle from scratch. Last night I came up with 5 topic articles to write about all around the email marketing niche in a matter of 3-5 minutes. Again, for folks who routinely get creative and do this sort of thing, it’s not a big deal. But for me...it is a game-changer. I’ll also note that I have and use Buzzsumo and Ahrefs (Content Explorer) & neither of them has helped me quite the way SEMrush’s Topic Research Tool has. ✅ Historical Keyword ReportsThis was the main reason I started using SEMRush. The way we strategize, manage, & report on our SEO campaigns requires us to pull historical keyword rankings data & compare it to current data. Ahrefs has a similar feature but you aren’t given the ability to set the dates yourself & I’m not sure you can export their rankings trends graph either. ✅ Location-Based Keyword TrackingWe work with a lot of small businesses where local SEO is important. Being able to track keywords based on location (and/or multiple locations for that property) is super nice. Ahrefs allows for this to some extent but it doesn’t seem nearly as accurate as SEMrush in this regard. ✅ Data Studio IntegrationIf you’re familiar with Data Studio then you’ll love this integration. You can build out a large variety of reports using data from SEMrush that would require API access to other tools to do (Ahrefs does not currently have a Data Studio integration). The DS connectors can be a bit wonky at times & their site could definitely use some more examples of how to set everything up, but all-in-all, it’s a very nice feature that we rely on for our reporting with clients. 🟦 Other Nice to Have’s 🟦Here are some quick “nice-to-have” features of SEMrush that I haven’t fully explored yet:🥈Integrates with your social accounts & can handle some posting functionality/tracking. 🥈Can help you with listing management if you’re a local business where citations are still very important. 🥈Content marketing/editorial calendar. I haven’t tried this yet because we manage everything via Asana & Google Sheets but I’ve been curious to see what it entails. 🥈Push site audit issues directly to Trello. This is a nice touch & they’re working on a Zapier integration so you can push items to other PM tools as well. This will be a great feature for us once they roll it out since we use Asana. 🔴 Cons 🔴Take these cons with a grain of salt. They’re not all that bad & mainly consist of things I just wish the tool/company had. ❌ A Better Content Marketing TeamOkay, so I love all the content SEMrush puts out, however, the primary reason I still use Ahrefs is because of how excellent their content is: both in written & especially in video form. The video guides, use cases, and more general educational content that Sam has put together for Ahrefs is not only the reason I signed up for Ahrefs first but also why I still default to Ahrefs anytime I need to do a quick task. It has nothing to do with SEMrush as a tool as it’s perfectly capable of doing the common things I do in Ahrefs as well — it has everything to do with how familiar I am with Ahrefs & how to use it. While SEMrush does have a solid set of posts, guides, & even courses on how to use their tool...they’re just not as good. The production quality is often a bit awkward and could use more refined post-production editing. Now, this is something that may seem like a minor thing that shouldn’t matter, but the education of your users should be of the utmost importance when it comes to user adoption if you want to build brand advocates. Useful education is one that provides multiple scenarios, and it’s on the fundamentals over & over again. ❌ No Top Pages ReportI may be mistaken but I couldn’t find a top pages report similar to one Ahrefs has.Hope this review was helpful for others in the market! 🙌"
Swarup Mohanty,1,5,Excellent 👍 as always favourite for me other also. Like and love it.Thanks SEMRUSH team
Jamie Barren,2,5,"As of today, I've completed 13 SEMrush Courses & Exams; and all within 30 days. Overall, the courses are extremely informative (and practically essential), the instructors are personable and thorough, and the end result (completing the courses) is uplifting and so rewarding; leaving me confident and excited to put to use all my new found knowledge. Honestly, I could write forever about how much I've enjoyed taking SEMrush's courses -- a MUST for anyone looking to brush up their skills; and definitely learn something new ... easily and, moreover, FREE of charge!! The courses provide all the need-to-know SEO essentials and the instructors make it so easy to understand and retain information. All in all, the value that SEMrush provides is priceless. And one thing's for sure; SEMrush tools (and courses) will give you a competitive edge and set you apart from the competition."
Ramakrishna Akula,1,4,SEMrush is one of the blogs or pages on LinkedIn that I follow. I recently started exploring this tool to get blog topics. I'm happy for the topics that it suggests.
Smita Poojary,3,5,"Excellent tool to use for all your SEO projects.You can use SEMrush for social listening, brand monitoring and social posting too.The keyword magic tool is really useful to explore more keywords. Position tracking feature enables us to keep a track of the rankings of our pages.Lots to learn and explore and they keep innovating and improving the product."
Dean Dallman,1,2,"The overall scope of the tool is great - it's mainly the bugs and errors with the content audit tool that have taken the three stars off for me because that's what I use it for.I've had numerous issues with sitemaps not being picked up properly, I've downloaded audits and the when I've tried to click into the 'article content' link the page just loads - and that's it. You can arrange content by sessions, word count etc but when you download it it reverts back to whatever order it was in the first place. I've had nothing but problems with the tool ever since I started using it. If you do a lot of content auditing I wouldn't recommend SEMrush.It's quite difficult to get in touch with customer service, too. Sometimes you get this annoying bot that is absolutely useless. Other times, a person. I've got to the point now where when I have an issue I can't even be bothered to navigate the endless maze to a person.I find the interface a bit too much as well, think Ahrefs is easier on the eye."
Erik Sunset,1,5,SEMrush is my favorite SEO tool and their people are great.
Jamil Ahmed,1,5,I have been in Digital Marketing for over 5 years. Learned so many skills to scale up my online business. One of the greatest choices I have made for my online business is using SEMrush. I have ranked over 3000 keywords in Google following the suggestion of SEMrush data.Amazing features I love about SEMrush are:1. Data accuracy (best compared to anyone else in the market)2. Competitive analysis3. Preparing SEO content template4. User-friendly interface
Darrell Wilson,1,5,"I've been a front-end developer for over 10 years and over the last year or so have been increasingly focussed on technical SEO for clients of my digital agency. Probably like most people when they start focussing on SEO I was using a lot of different tools for researching keywords, backlinks, gap analysis, monitoring serp positions for my clients and their competiors etc. I realised I would be far better off using a service which could offer a combined suite of tools that I needed in order to do the work for my clients. I spent some time researching other SEO/SEM tools but after using the free trial version of SEMrush for a while I knew it was the right service for me. I purchased the Pro version to get started but am already considering upgrading to the Guru version as my SEO specific work continues to grow.I have been really impressed with both the educational content provided by SEMrush Academy as well as the friendly and supportive community around the SEMrush social media channels.Very happy with my choice of SEMrush. Great tool."
Andrew Daniel,2,5,"Free bite-size online learning modules led by a mix of experts from the SEM Industry. The small self-contained videos are kept fresh by a change of tone from the various instructors.I decided to set myself a challenge over the coronavirus lockdown and enrolled myself on to the SEO, SEMrush Tools and Competitive Research modules. I have now become more efficient at using the SEMrush tools, enabling me to offer the very best service to my clients while making my day more productive.The above also resulted in 20 certificates added to my CV for just 40hrs of my time, I’m now intrigued to see what the remaining modules can offer.With 18 years experience in digital marketing, I’m confident that any student, blogger, affiliate marketer or marketing consultant will benefit by investing their time into SEMrush Academy.Great work from the team at SEMrush!"
Phil,2,4,Keyword Data could be a little more up to date but best bang for your buck.
Arup Parali,1,5,"A couple of years ago, I was using different tools for the different task. For example, a separate tool for content research, another for keyword research and another for backlink strategy and many more. After using 50+ tool, I came to know about SEMrush which seems to be an all-in-one tool.Do you know what is the all-in-one tool mean?After exploring couple of SEMrush alternatives, I have earned a better understanding of what is all-in-one really mean.SEMrush is really good on several factors and has the potential to help to get ranked in the search result.This is a must-use tool."
Mustafa Elnagar,2,5,"Using SEMrush We boosted our organic traffic for Mindvalley.com, First thing I do every Monday morning is to check the automated report of TECH SEO and it gives me the best and the most accurate direction where I should be focusing this week for TECH SEO. Also the SEMrush blog is one of my favorite blogs for TECH SEO. I'm enjoying reading the informative articles. SEMrush is more than a tool, it's a community :)"
Ankit Mishra,1,5,"Our association with SEMRush is of more than 4 years. Before I joined my current organization was using some other SEO tool, on my recommendation we subscribed to SEMRush, and today each and everyone member in our Digital Team loves this tool and use it for their day-to-day task when it comes to SEO, PPC or Content Creation. SEMRush Sensor is such a great feature that I personally rely for observing search engine's behaviors.I and EazyStock recommends SEMRush as one of the best tool when it comes to SEO and Content !!"
Gabrielle Bliss,1,4,"Love SEMrush's insights. Specifically, the backlink building tool and the site audit tool are extremely helpful. Only complaint is that the organic keywords tool often has discrepancies with other keyword research tools!"
puya turkiyan,1,5,There are a handful of tools I can't live without for my digital marketing campaigns. One of them is SEMrush and they're in the top two. I have a Guru license but I can't wait to upgrade.
T.J. Higgins,1,5,SEMrush is a mandatory tool I rely on for all things SEO and content marketing.  And their free online academy is superb!
Umm-E- Habiba,1,5,"I just heard from people that they got certification from SEMrush and Hubspot, I used to feel a wish sometime, man why I couldn't and can't. In these 5 months of lockdown, I started SEMrush exams relative to Digital marketing and SEO.Trust me if anyone want to fill his plate with a recipe of knowledge, SEMrush and it's community  are good or even best at it.From taking exams to get certified, they congratulated me on my every success. Cheers 🙂"
Nat Miletic,1,5,"SEMrush is a great tool and highly recommendedSome of my favorite features are keyword analysis, competitor analysis and most importantly the content template feature.The content template is what sets this tool apart from the competition. It generates a unique template that you can use to write great content and rank your website for that content."
Arthur Choi,1,5,SEMRush has been our saviour for the past 7 years. Their tools have greatly benefited us and we are so thankful to have them around on social media giving us constant tips on how to better interact with our clients on all facets of digital marketing.

Abhishek -,2,5,SEMrush is Most Professional SEO Tool used by marketers all over the world. I am using it for my blog. Which is expensive for beginners.
Minneapolis Marketer,2,5,"We've come to rely on SEMrush tools and reports on a daily basis. We find their data and staff support is accurate and robust. It's also well-worth the investment for building peer and influencer relationships in addition to excelling in SEO and SEM client services. If you are new to the search marketing industry, consider SEMrush a must-have suite for improving online visibility and discovering marketing insights."
Dave Bochichio,1,5,"SEMrush is an excellent SEO toolset that I've used for five months now. It contains keyword research capabilities, content research, technical SEO audits, competitor analysis, link-building tools, keyword position tracking, social media tracking/posting, and much more. Totally worth the price-tag and will give you an edge over your competition."
Phil Drinkwater,2,5,"SEMrush are aiming to help small businesses as well as agencies with all of their online marketing needs ... and they are succeeding. I've used the product for nearly a decade now and, in that time, it's moved on from just SEO into social media and content marketing. As a small business, it's the one piece of software I'd recommend in order to make more of your precious time."
Lukasz,7,5,I am using SEMRush for almost 10 years. Its undisputed champion tool in SEO industry. Also its great that SEMRush is always open for suggestions from users. Many thanks for decade of collaboration!
James Russell,1,5,"I've been using Semrush now for over 9 months and let me tell you this, it's been a life saver. Managing over 12 websites for work can be challenging for one person.Having Semrush at my fingertips allows me to manage all the SEO for the sites with ease. It's like having a team of SEO professionals working 24/7 on my sites to help improve the ranking of them.The tools that are available such as the post tracking and content assistant help me add SEO rich content to my sites that boost organic traffic naturally within days not weeks or months.Without Semrush I don't know how I would be able to manage all the sites myself. Keep up the good work Semrush and keep adding more tools and resources to help us webmasters out.I am a customer for life!Thanks,JR"
Leola Ijaola,1,5,
Steve Zissman,1,5,"I've tried many SEO programs over the past 15+ years, but after I tried SEMrush about 5 years ago, it quickly became my go-to for virtually all of my SEO/SEM needs.  Whether it's tracking keywords, determining competition strategy, conducting technical site and backlink audits, setting up PPC programs, keyword discovery and reporting to my clients, I've never used anything that can even come close when considering accuracy and convenience.The one time I needed support, the response was quick, accurate in understanding and helping to fix the problem (which was on my end), and they followed up a few days later to see that everything was still working as expected.Everything's in one place, and with the constant improvements, new features and great support, I can't see myself ever leaving."
ValV,1,5,"If you want to be a marketing leader in your industry than SEMrush tool is the place to go. Using this toolkit for keyword research, competitive analysis and content marketing helped the business to build up a strong marketing strategy. In addition the resource section is infinite so whether you are a beginner or at an advanced level will help you to become an all-around specialist. The only suggestion I would mention is to make the tabs more user-friendly. Sometimes you can get lost in the abundance of options."
Mike Friedman,1,5,"SEMrush is the most complete full suite of tools available for search marketing. If I was only going to subscribe to one tool, this would be the one.Whether I am looking for market research, keyword identification and research, competitor search ad data, or ranking and reporting, SEMrush is the first place I go."
William Rock,1,5,"I love the toolset, these guys are always building something new into the suite. I have been using the tool starting around 2008 :)The entire staff is amazing, I have been able to work with them at live events including seminars as well their amazing online workshops keeping me up to date on things other marketers are doing with their websites. If you manage a website, it is totally worth the money,  especially with their Audit Tools helping you to identify areas of your website that may need improvement helping your overall technical SEO. I feel like I am always learning with weekly online seminars, especially since they work with some of the Top SEO Influencers all over the world.  (Tons of SMART People)Another great resource would be their SEO Academy where they have free online digital marketing courses & exams to help increase your skills from beginner to advanced. One of my other favorite tools would be the Domain Overview Report allowing you to type in any domain including your competition giving you a ton of very insightful information. Give it a try, I know you will like it. // I am in the tool just about every day."
ali vaezi,1,5,You know : I've used the Ahrefs for analyzing but i think that the SEMrush better than Ahrefs .congrats:)
Sneh Mishra,1,5,"Everyone in this outbreak in suffering from financial crunch, that hit me too!I started looking for free digital marketing courses where I came to know about SEMrush Academy.I am delighted to learn from the incredible SEMrush Team that too free of cost.Thanks a ton for your kind gesture in this pandemic."
Joe Garrison,1,5,"SEMRush has been a huge help as I write copy and build out websites for local businesses. The SEO Writing Assistant Add-on for Google Docs is a game-changer. I wireframe my pages in Google Docs, this saves a ton of time bringing it all into one space."
Melisha Oakleaf-Wilson,1,5,"I LOVE SEMrush! It has made my life SO much easier as I wear many hats and am always looking for ways to improve efficiencies. Along with the social media poster, I really enjoy the fact that I can pull reports for social accounts, create scheduled posts and I'm able to access everything in one spot. I love the Content Audit options and the SEO keyword magic tool. There is literally NOTHING I would change about this tool. It's so powerful, I haven't even gotten to use all the bells and whistles yet, but I'm SO EXCITED! We've never had fancy tools at my work and this is making my life SO MUCH EASIER."
Louise Hawkins,7,5,"The SEMrush platform has a fabulous array of tools and reports to help digital marketers and SEO's excel. In addition, there is an invaluable range of courses and accreditations you can do for free. And a wealth of resources and knowledge on the SEMrush blog. Oh, and support is excellent too! I simply wouldn't be without SEMrush"
Rami Makhamreh,1,5,"SEMRush always deliver the best tools and solutions to exceed the expectations,"
Joe Matkin,4,5,
Clayton Cross,7,1,The competitive intelligence tool does not work. The data is very inaccurate - it is a poor mans attempt to copy similarweb.  The most annoying thing is terrible staff and when covid hit all they tried to do was take more money off you.
Rüdiger Kuntz,3,5,The service offers a lot of features for seo and at a very low price. The service is stable and support answered me at night! Recommend
Nordberg25,1,1,"Signed up for 7 day free trial, was billed $333.55 instantly. After making several attempts to contact SEMrush for a refund, I was left with no choice but to file a chargeback. So they took the liberty to disable my account, if I try to login it says account disabled, but here's the part they don't disable. The recurring payment, they just whacked me with another $333.55 charge a month later. Stay away from this shady company."
David Iwanow,1,5,Decent SEO suite and 5-10x cheaper than alternatives like Brightedge depending on which SEMrush package you offer and SEMrush has most of the same features
Himani Kankaria,1,5,"I've been using SEMrush for the past 5 years now especially for SEO, content writing, and now even for social media marketing. The team has researched in detail and have gathered everything that a marketer would need in a tool and how they don't like managing data separately on different tools. This one tool is capable enough for almost everything from identifying the gaps in technical SEO, optimizing the website for search engines to analyzing the performance of all your marketing channels. If you don't use it, you would regret it."
David Rosam,1,5,"SEMrush is the most complete set of digital marketing tools I know. It's continually growing and evolving, giving me more opportunities to deliver services more efficiently to my clients.Oh, and the SEMrush team is great, too."
Judith Lewis,1,5,"I've been using SEMRush for some years now but noticed the ratings and wanted to voice my opinion. I know the UI is a bit non-intuitive at times and you need to get used to how things are laid out but the functionality more than makes up for some awkward UI.I really love using it and cannot imagine any one tool being as useful, powerful and comprehensive as SEMRush. I realise it sounds a little too gushing but I have found weaknesses in PPC for pitches where I was only covering SEO but helped add to the PPC part, I've found clients new competitors they didn't realise they had, links they should get, keywords they could target, and more. I think the middle level is the best (I think it's Guru) as it gives you the ability to go back in time but also the lower level is great. The top level gets API access and all sorts but really, I'm a Guru level fan. I do talk a lot at conferences and in classes I teach about SEMRush because it covers so much and have for years so I'm not just a quiet user but really a genuine proud user."
Jaydip Parikh,1,5,"If you are owning Digital Agency or you are SEO / PPC Consultant this tool is kind of Swiss Knife for you. You can do a lot many things with various option of the tool. Keywords Research, Data Analytics, Prediction, Content Planning, Automated tracking of ranking as well as reports kind of key things you can do with this tool. If you want to get more insight into the website you are working, you must give a try to this tool."
Nitin Manchanda,1,5,"I’ve been using SEMrush for a few years now and what I love about it is, continuous evolvement. It is in fact my favourite SEO toolkit now because of many reasons and I don’t think any other tool can beat that because of the variety covered by SEMRush, and not to forget, they’re only adding new features to what they already have."
Dom O'Neill,1,5,Whenever I need to know anything about SEO and digital marketing SEMrush is who I turn to. Their YouTube Channel and guest blogs are full of useful advice which has helped me my thousands of extra dollars over the past few years!
Tom Livingstone,1,5,SEMrush is a great suite of tools and data. They're always adding new features and releasing new tools that make it the market leader. I couldn't work without it.
Viola,1,5,"Great tool with a huge variety of functionality for SEO and paid. I enjoyed the webinars, education, and community of experts around SEMrush."
James Boshier,1,1,"Signed up for the 7 day free trial as I wanted to give it a test for my business,Found it a decent product but wasn't ready to commit. Problem #1You have to literally search how to cancel you 7-day free trial. It's not just under subscription. SEM Rush, one of your tools is a UX analysis. I'd recommend running your own site through it.Problem #2You literally have to email them to cancel. The experience is like ordering Uber and a horse and cart turns up. Email to cancel?! One can only imagine it is to ensure they can charge your card. Everyone is going to try and use 6.9 days before cancelling a trial. Why would you be the type of company that tricks people into a FREE TRIAL, only to screw them over? I like your product. I will literally use a competitor even if they are substandard to you, because I value ethics over quality any given day of the week."
Eric Bechtel,1,5,"Their account management is top-notch, always available to help with training or answer a question. This helps because their product is so in-depth and comprehensive, that it's nice to have a professional guide you along what is most important for your businesses!"
Collin Slattery,2,3,"SEMrush is okay. You will frequently find that their data is lacking. It's good for rank monitoring in terms of SEO, but for keyword research, ad research, and things like that it is pretty underwhelming. You'll frequently find situations where there's 100,000+ searches a month for a buying keyword and they somehow have no ad history at all for it. If you're looking for rank tracking, it is very good, but the research tools are pretty useless. I've been paying for the software for years (really only for rank tracking at this point) and I have found that 75% of the time when I go to research something on there, their data is either incomplete, wildly inaccurate, or non-existent."
Gerry White,5,5,"Its an awesome toolkit - been using this for 5+ years now and spoken at length with the product team who are genuinely interested in getting the maximum value from their data. It is unusual for a kit that does so much to do it quite so well, and their community / content is incredible!"
Arianne Donoghue,1,5,"I've used SEMrush for many years and it's been truly invaluable to me in many of the roles that I've done. Whether it's putting together a pitch, investigating an opportunity for a client, reviewing the competition or putting a strategy together, it's one of my favourite tools to use.It helps that the team who run SEMrush are also wonderful - I've had the chance to meet many of them at conferences and other events and I can't speak highly enough of them."
Sandeep Mallya,2,5,"SEMrush is my go-to tool for all things SEO-related. Whether it's keyword research, competitor analysis, or backlink data, you can always rely on SEMrush to provide you with accurate insights to outmaneuver your competitors in search results."
Cindy R,25,5,"I was really pleased with the customer service. We are having financial issue due to the coronavirus and SemRush agreed with us with a better option to help us in this exceptional situation. The tool is excellent and once we are back to normal, hopefully we can go back to our initial plan."
Brodie Clark,1,5,I'm a solo SEO consultant so I need to choose my tools wisely. I've been using the SEMrush suite since day one. There's something in there for just about every purpose and they are high quality features too (there's no cutting corners). My favourite tool of theirs is the ability to see SERP screenshots for months back for certain queries. No other SEO tool on the market does this. Is insane that it's even possible – but SEMrush have somehow pulled it off. Would recommend.
Olesia Korobka,3,5,"My go to solution for keyword research, part of competitors backlink analysis. I'm also fond of project features including mentions and backlinks alerts (see Brand Monitoring), sync with GSC (see Organic Traffic Insights), and I find the keyword tracking tool to be one of the most accurate compared to many others I'm using for national organic tracking purposes.Highly recommend SEMrush to anyone who's thinking of what to choose for their SEO processes."
Tom,1,1,"False advertisement for their offers, when you say offer until 12th March stick to it. Lost a potential customer now"
Vivian 	Harmon,5,5,"Great tool for SEO, it's a good tool you can use."
Peter Mead,1,5,"Absolutely amazing set of tools, with the features being updated all the time. This is the goto tool, from checking a competitors domain on the fly, through to full analysis of your site and recommendations for improving. This is absolutely essential for the day to day SEO work! Worth every cent!"
Andrew,7,1,Once this company has your details they will spam you. I have told them many times I am not interested and yet they continue. The main thing that puts me off is the poor marketing campaigns that they run for there own business and now fake reviews. Look at the dates of the reviews. I do hope Trustpilot will look into this.
Milosz,2,5,"My team and I running international outreach and linking building campaigns that includes almost all countries in the world including the very exotic ones. Traffic analytics of Semrush module is able to evaluate each domain based on the entire visits, direct, social, search etc rather than just organic traffic. It's what other SEO tools struggle to deliver. In return we have been able to navigate 1 million domains and extract the most powerful ""news websites"" around the world in any language."
Jimmi Nielsen,26,5,
Anil Agarwal,1,5,"I've been doing SEO for more than a decade now and I pretty much used all the SEO tools. Out of them, I found SEMrush the most useful SEO toolkit for my website needs. It not only helps me with keyword research but I can also find and fix all the technical issues my site has. Works like a charm when it comes to analysing my competitor websites (whether to find their top performing keywords or knowing their SEO/content strategies). If you're someone who is looking for an all in one SEO toolkit to perform almost every SEO related task, SEMrush is definitely a great choice for you. I've been using it for more than 4 years now and I'm extremely happy with it. There's a small caveat though: it needs a learning curve (because it gives you access to over 40 tools, so it takes time to start using each one effectively)."
Kevin Gibbons,9,5,"I've used SEMrush for a long time, it's always been a goto SEO tool and has evolved with the market over the years to become / remain an essential part of the marketers toolkit."
Jason Barnard,6,5,"SEMrush ticks all the boxes for keeping tabs on digital marketing efforts from rankings, to Google Ads to rich elements to mentions and links... and even copywriting. Ace."
Anton Voroniuk,1,5,"SEMRush is a great tool for competitive analysis. We use it regularly for our courses at WebPromoExperts Online Marketing Academy. Data from SEMRush helps our students get great results in digital marketing activities.I highly recommend this tool for marketers, digital marketers, SEO & PPC specialists!"
Mitchell Thomas,1,5,Tool that every SEO/digital marketer should have in their arsenal. Excellent features and great support! Makes managing on going campaigns a breeze.
Paul Delaney,3,5,Invaluable tool for the SEO community and marketeers. Easy to use and entry level package value for money
Ben Atherton,1,5,Superb service that has become integral to daily tasks.
Gareth Hoyle,3,5,"Love this tool - It is my #1 go to for most stages - We use it to find opportunities, we use it to gather pitch data and we use it to manage the ongoing campaigns. Very responsive team and love their community!"
Akshay Hallur,2,5,"SEMrush is a great tool with tons of features. The features like SEO content template, SEO writing assistant makes perfect sense in the semantic age of SEO! For SEO, features like Backlink and Keyword Gap Analysis are great.Seems like SEMrush is growing greatly after their recent funding :-)But UI/UX needs a little refinement."
Ahmed Kamal Khan,1,5,
Bostjan Tanko,2,5,"I have been using Semrush for just over 1 year now, and since the start, I have been seeing great results! One of my websites has grown for more than 125% (before I started using Semrush I was getting 11k users monthly and in 1 year I was able to get to 30k user per month)Thank you Semrush for making this possible.I would recommend Semrush to anyone who is serious about digital marketing!"
Trevor Stolber,2,5,I am an avid and enthusiastic user of SEMRush. I am building my agency and SOPs around the SEMRush processes and tool sets.They have an active and engaged community and take user feedback very seriously by constantly introducing new capabilities and staying one step ahead of the curve.I have used Moz and Ahrefs in the past and they are good tools too. I like all of the set up and automation you get with SEMRush.There are various account levels and options to add users and share projects with other users. They are competitively priced compared to their main rivals and upgrading sounds expensive but has always been worth it for me.I love this tool and I would highly recommend it!
Donna Donahue,1,5,I have used SEMrush for almost three years.  I live in the tool daily and use almost every feature. From the projects to position tracking I know I can count on SEMrush to deliver the results I need to provide quality research for my job responsibilities.  On top of being a quality tool SEMrush delivers quality training material through webinars and certification courses.  I would recommend SEMrush to beginning and expert level SEO professionals.
Vladimir Gertner,1,5,"SEMrush is a great SEO tool ""bag"". It gives you everything you need packed in a neat package. But, the most impressive part is the community. The developers at SEMrush react to feedback and develop new tools accordingly."
Duncan Elsey,4,2,"We started with the free trial - the software great, but the free trial required a credit card, and the process to cancel at the end was ridiculous. Despite saying we would sign up when ready there were repeated attempts to set up calls etc. Then despite assurances they wouldn't charge our card - they did anyway. It feels like the pressure is on me to force them to cancel and now to issue a refund. This is supposed to be a FREE trial. So now I just don't trust them - don't give them your credit card details!UPDATE - yes SEMRush did issue a refund. However as my card was Canadian I lost $15 in the currency conversions. Still not acceptable.Update - SEMRush did get in touch and gave us a free months subscription (no credit card required!) which is appreciated. Hopefully they will also sort out the cancellation process."
Gerald,3,3,I have thought product is good. It's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Not a lot of other companies you can get this sort of data from
TenX Digital Marketing,1,1,"Have been using them for several months and without notice they reduced the number of allowed campaigns/projects by 60%!This makes a already expensive service well overpriced when compared with the competition.Some other niggles also like their Social Media Poster Tool, let's you schedule Facebook posts but not Instagram.Listing management tool is additional cost and not viable considering you need to continue paying each month for a tool that does the job once at the beginning.Will be looking at Ahrefs instead."
Habert,1,1,"NEVER BUY THEIR ANNUAL PLAN OR YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET ONE DAY LIKE ME.I have being using semrush for more than two years. I subscribed to Guru 1 month Recurring $199.95 and use traffic analytics mostly.The issue came first in November 2018, they suspended the access of traffic analytics after I used them for more than a year. I contacted them and Nikolay got back to me sand said their management has decided recently to charge separately for traffic analytics first and then they admitted that there was a bit of misunderstanding on their side, all functions of traffic analytics had been restored for my account in the next email.I thought its fixed and they looked promising, and then changed to the annual plan on Apr 10, 2019.Out of the blue, again, they suspended the access of traffic analytics  in this month. I contacted Nikolay again and he said ""At the time you changed your plan from monthly to annual subscription all new Guru plans did not have traffic analytics access included by default. Due to this change (monthly to annual) you do not have access to this feature now."", so WHY didn't you mention this and suspend the access when I changed to annual plan, but suspended it after 8 months??!P.S. I asked for refund for the remaining amount but still didn't get any reply, not to mention the access of traffic analytics."
Stephen Hall,10,1,"Really not good.The support is poor, the site fails on so many levels, I will be going back to link assistant as they cost less and provide better data.plus when you ask for help they help, semrush just took 2h 21m of chat to tell me nothing other than the settings are wrong fix yourself..Recurring payment cancelled and never returning."
Nick Campos,3,3,"I'm not sure if this is really an issue, but I noticed I couldn't be signed in to SEMrush while a coworker was at the same time. Other than that, it has been incredibly helpful for our agency when it comes to giving us insight into how our clients are doing on major SERPs."
John M,1,5,"I've been using Semrush for several years now. I'm not a ""power-user"", but I track my 2 websites and make quite a few adjustments based on the ranking factors and other info I get from them. I use Semrush with google analytics, and with those 2, I'm able to consistently rank higher and make more money with adsense."
Leyla Mehmet,2,1,Continuously deduct money from your account after you cancel. This has been on and off for 3 years. Have no banned them from taking payments via my bank. They have deducted 100 per month for a full year even though I cancelled back in 2017. Total Scam. My bank manager says they consistently get complaints re: this behaviour from SEM rush.
Trevor J.,3,5,"Great all-in-one tool to get your website optimized.Loved using this tool with my start-up team from day one. Price is high, but I believe the value is too."
simachim,5,5,"No discussion, this is the best in class website performance tool available. Who has the SEO bits of knowledge, must confirm this."
Ankit Pora,1,1,Banned the account as for security issues and not telling what does that even mean
Andreea Luka,2,5,Thank you for making my life easier. An essential tool for any marketing/seo specialist in my opinion.
Walter White,22,1,"Shame on Semrush management. If you are running a shopify site, you will never get proper audit, suggestions results. Semrush membership is useless if you are a Shopify site. Shopify blocks their crawlers and it's been several years since Semrush is ignoring that fact, cheating site owners!This is ridiculous that when you sign up with semrush and they are charging you money, nobody in their customer service bothers to tell you that ""secret"". You only find out when either audit crawler gets stock for days on some page or you get all of your pages with 404 errors according to crawler when its not true. Once you call Semrush, that's when they say ""oups its a known problem"".SHAME!!! That company of such magnitude is not doing anything to make a deal with shopify or come up with some kind of Shopify Audit app to communicate audit results from shopify to Semrush in stand alone mode. This is so stupid of Semrush!!! Laughable. Small moms and pops shops are able to create audit apps on shopify. Seriously w.t.f.????"
seoguy,1,1,"Extremely bad and arrogant customer service. Disabled the account multiple times under the pretext of policy violation even though explained to them that I need to log in from multiple laptops - work, office, remote office. Nothing worked. In the end, they just said ""well, you've been violating our user policy for 4 years and got away with it"". I usually judge companies by the people that work there. This company left a bad taste in my mouth. The actual tool is so-so too. I get more from Ahrefs or Majestic."
laura,3,4,"A must-have tool to track your keywords, organic growth, competitors and more. I use it together with other tools to see the whole picture of my company traffic growth."
Fernado Cortes,4,5,"Totally the best SEO analyzing platform.  Tried many others, all in one platform, great daily alerts on site audits."
Elian Ionescu,2,5,"Used for more than 3 years, I'm a happy customer."
Diana,1,2,"Honestly, it's not the best software i've used; keywords tools are a bit scratchy, it's definitely not suitable for businesses"
Arnold Benedict Mantos,2,3,Submitted my Tax Form for my Affiliate Account. Declined 3 times. I submitted the right documents and filled up the right details.
Nico,4,4,"Doesn't do everything and is bit overpriced, but has some really great features and API for developers."
Rudy Merouchi,1,2,"Honestly not the best sofware, the keywords Tools are a bit sketchy, is defenetly not suitable for agencies"
Garry,3,4,"The best all-in-one tool for marketers. But I don't know if it's just my computer, but the application is quite slow."
chad Bergmann,1,1,"I could not get anything on to give any results, the only thing I found that worked was there billing. They are happy to take your $99 a month and give you ""No Data"""
Brett Topovski,4,1,"I think SEMRush has way too much fluffy data and poor keywords listed as branded and non-branded keywords. This service also lacks historical data related to keywords available from other similar keyword research tools, which is very useful for advanced keyword research. After comparing SEMRush to other keyword and backlink research resources, I would never recommend SEMRush to any SEO specialists, but it may be okay for SEM experts. It's called SEMRush, not SEORush...."
クエンティンべインサント,1,2,"The tool is good and has great features - though it is not necessarily easy to use. But my main complaint is not here. After my trial ended I subscribed to a Guru plan ($199, definitely not cheap). A few days later, I received an email saying that my account was suspended and that I needed to provide an ID and a scan of my credit card for payment verification, despite the payment having been processed by my bank. I understand the need for security, but giving only TWO business days to resolve these kinds of matters and suspending an account - on a Friday - without prior notice is simply unprofessional. Especially at that price. I was on a business trip at that time and couldn't see the email before the deadline, so in the end I decided to let it go and never subscribe to SEM Rush again."
Promo 4codez,2,4,Everything is perfect but your keyword difficulty finder always show high KD on every keyword
Toni,7,4,Really good tool but not too cheap either
Kylee Wil.,2,4,"They are okay, I use semrush everyday always good metrics!"
Begüm,2,5,My job is SEO Expert and I usually use Semrush. Thanks for all update.
Anita Wisdom,3,1,I signed up for a free trial. I didn't really find the site easy to use - but maybe that's just me. I used it once and have it in my diary to cancel tomorrow.A day before my 7 day trial expires SEMrush try to take £273 from my debit card - for SEMrush services in 3 countries which I never signed up for.I'm shocked and when I went online to cancel - it says I have to email the office and they'll get back to me. Disgusting and dishonest if you ask me.
CryptoWatcher,8,5,Been using for over a month and wish I started sooner. Very easy to use.
Justin Case,4,5,Useful seo tracking and managing service. Like it.
Laurentia,6,5,They always share information about seo and marketing that is up to date written by experts.
Brendon from BigHouse Production,3,4,"very nice SEO tool, although it could be a little bit more user friendly. It takes a while to figure things out and learn how to use it properly. But once you get it, it's a good tool you can use."
Shovon Joarder,7,5,I am using Semrush since 2015. Tried other SEO tools but I feel that Semrush is the only all in one SEO tools. It helps me grow my Digital Marketing business.
Jack,2,4,Love using SEMRush its a great way to audit site and source new KW.
June Mayers,5,4,"Support is listenning, answer back in less than one day (e-mail) and the tool is very useful and completeI recommand"
Darren Hazan,2,5,Not only is the service they provide fantastic but their customer service was rapid to reply when I had a problem and they resolved it immediately. They are a bit pricier than some others but worth every penny
Mari Bilirenko,2,5,"SemSrush together with SimilarWeb, and Ahrefs, create you the most powerful competitor and web marketing toolkit possible."
Indre,1,5,"Great variety of reports - from backlink audits, content ideas to mention tracking. SEMrush is also constantly adding new features tailored to daily digital marketers needs. Recommend!"
Mark,1,1,Decent features but poor money garbing practice by making it a hard  to cancel subscription resulting in me being charged another month unnecessarily.
Ivan Mackay,5,4,Use it every day in my work. For sure can recommend it to all marketers. But I really do not understand their Keywords difficulty metric. If compare it to Ahrefs for the same keyword Semrush show completely different numbers.
gulpreet singh,3,4,One of the must have tools for Internet marketers.
Chris Bedford,4,5,Amazing free services! Great for seo and all things online. Cant go wrong here.
Sergei,4,5,"Comprehensive analysis of search traffic, site audit, position tracking. Good value for money"
Rob B,16,5,"I left another high profile company to try SEMRush and have not looked back. The data is more relevant and trustworthy, the sites works for UK out of the box and the price is competitive for the service you get. So far so good."

I contacted them immediately and requested a refund I was offered a discount which I declined as I no longer require the software and received no response I have done this twice now and same thing has happed I have yet to receive a refund even though their website states refund within 5 working days and 30’day money back guarantee this has been going on since the 24/12, utterly disgusted in the poor customer service I am receiving and want a refund ASAP"

Jack Buonanducci,4 reviews,5 stars: Excellent,Your online  CS person was very helpful and  understanding my limited know how with computers
Marsha Brown,3 reviews,5 stars: Excellent,"I contacted Bitdefender via chat with a couple of questions, i.e. whether my anti-virus would be automatically renewed across all of my devices. I was answered quickly and professionally. I remember asking another question, but now I don't remember what that was. I do remember having that question similarly answered quickly and professionally."

Naraian legrand,1 review,4 stars: Great,"I use the free version and expect no problems! If any, the support team is great. Got back to me within a couple of days! It's light on your CPU while strong on the virus!"
Danny Cadman,6 reviews,1 star: Bad,Bought bitdefender thru PayPal didn’t receive my bitdefender code or anything to download from 2checkout apart from them asking for my bank details so I’ve escalated it with PayPal won’t be buying bitdefender ever again
Judith,1 review,5 stars: Excellent,I have had two issues with my renewals but both were resolved above my expectation and done very quickly.  This is an excellent product with excellent support which is rare these days.
Nancy Nystuen,1 review,5 stars: Excellent,I needed to ‘transfer’ my Bitdefender service to my new hard drive (old one fried in electrical outage).  Asked for assistance by phone and detailed instructions sent by email.
James Barton,8 reviews,5 stars: Excellent,Head & Shoulders above the rest!  Norton talks about what BITDEFENDER  Gets Done.   Great Product and Customer Service which is seldom needed. Flawless Interface and Best Protection.
Kristen Lee,1 review,2 stars: Poor,"Auto renewal taken for £69.99 when I wasn’t aware I even had that in place. I contacted them immediately and requested a refund I was offered a discount which I declined as I no longer require the software and received no response I have done this twice now and same thing has happed I have yet to receive a refund even though their website states refund within 5 working days and 30’day money back guarantee this has been going on since the 24/12, utterly disgusted in the poor customer service I am receiving and want a refund ASAP"
R.Acevedo,1 review,5 stars: Excellent,"Excellent Tech Support. Reached an agent fairly quickly, explained my concern, and was able to get clear and straightforward direction on a resolution that worked perfectly. 10 out of 10."
MICHAEL NEWEY,13 reviews,5 stars: Excellent,No IT expert but seems to provide extensive protection
Norman Johnson,1 review,5 stars: Excellent,I had Internet Security already installed on my computers. I had 60 days left on my subscription. I upgraded to Total Security not realizing that it was two different subscriptions. I called customer support and they explained to me what I did. They change everything over to Total Security and extended my subscription. Customer support was really professional. Thank You!
Michael,2 reviews,3 stars: Average,"Good product, but awful support/service. Received email saying I had 10 days to take advantage of a discounted renewal price, then promptly took money through auto-renewal 2 days later! When I contacted them they promised to refund the difference but then never issued the refund - and are ignoring any emails I send. Spoke to CS in chat and they promised to get someone to contact me. Nothing...Update - finally resolved. Thank you."
Kevin Poole,5 reviews,5 stars: Excellent,"I have been a customer for some years.  The Total Security software works well, does not slow down my system and on the one occasion when I have had to use customer support by phone, they resolved my issue straight away.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to clarify the confusion around the various different channels through which you can buy the software - straight renewal via the Dashboard is rarely the best value, and sometimes there are glitches in adding newly purchased licences onto existing subscriptions."
James,2 reviews,5 stars: Excellent,"Although there were initial install issues, this was not down to Bitdefender and they offered a solution in a timely manner even with it being a very busy period (mid lockdown). The product itself offers a large range of checks to ensure the computers and other devices I use are running smoothly. There are checks that my previous provider did not offer and it's ability to highlight even low risks to my devices allow me to make considered decisions about the action to take. The range of available features are impressive. The only downside would be the amount of data available to use on the VPN on the package I have, but having never used one before it isn't something that is a large concern."
Laura C. Bergman,1 review,5 stars: Excellent,"Some companies have customer service that you must email.  Not Bitdefender.  I called them, got a representative right away.  He was very helpful and resolved my issue (which, in all honesty, was my error.)"
Steve Sole,3 reviews,5 stars: Excellent,WOW!! I cannot believe how good this is!! My laptop has been running so slowly lately and I have been pulling my hair out!! Ran the scan and it must be running maybe 20x faster AT LEAST!! AMAZING and i managed to get a real good discount on it! Well worth its weight in gold! :)
Erle Penn Joe Jock,1 review,5 stars: Excellent,I switched from a previous antivirus system because there was one issue that they could not resolve.   Being with Bitdefender I have found that Bitdefender checks for more security issues and resolves them and gives me feedback as to what they found and how it was corrected.

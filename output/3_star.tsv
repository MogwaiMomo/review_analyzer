9		So far I’m not getting refills on my Rxs so I’ve had pay for another virtual doctor appointment. I’m going to contact my pharmacy for them to request Rx refills so I don’t need to pay for another doctor appointment. I use my HSA so it does use that money which I’d prefer to keep in my HSA for future use now that we know my Rx is working well for me.
14		My experience with the Dr was pleasant enough, but he was supposed to write me a prescription for 90 days, but did 30 days - seemingly by mistake.
47		I signed up for my husband on my phone and all the info that went into the system was mine. The Dr had to redo everything. While we like the service the ap form is very lousey.
229		Service is great but after each visit you'll receive about 3 surveys links by email. God forbid you don't answer them as you'll be reminded daily until you do. There is no preference setting to turn them off. If I mark as Junk Mail, I take a chance of missing an actual important email.
290		"I have been reading these reviews, and I reserve my option to give them four or five stars, instead of three.  I do applaud them for giving people an opportunity to voice their reviews here about Plushcare.  I don't consider myself stupid, I have a college degree and a master's degree but somehow I  was led to believe that this was a.doctor's """"visit.""""  I stepped on a large staple, and it was embedded in my heel.  It was a Saturday night and I didn't want to go to the emergency room. We all know how that goes. I needed it removed. ( I explained all of that in the description/instructions) It was only after I paid the $99, did I see the Sunday a.m. appointment was a """"video"""" visit. Obviously, you can't remove a staple through a video visit.  Perhaps, my bad.  Well, I spent the rest of the night and early a.m. calling everywhere and sending emails everywhere to cancel this visit.  Finally, the next morning, I received an email from Plushcare, advising that I needed a person to person visit and that they were going to cancel the video visit and issue me a credit/refund. (To appear on my account within 10 days).  My complaints, are as follows:  Much of all of this was run through Algorithms, although understandably, all on off hours...Somehow, I believe I was DECEIVED into thinking this was going to be an in person visit and not a video visit. Why will it take 10 days for the credit to appear on my account?   The cancellation was made mere seconds after the charge.  (As people say money is very tight these days).  Also from reading all of these reviews I don't want to be charged $14.95, nor do I want to be a member at this time.  So, I hope that doesn't occur.  Plush Care certainly has a place in our business world, and no doubt is a great service for those people needing such a service.  But it didn't happen in my situation.  I will revisit this review upon a successful conclusion."
358		Doctor could have been more friendly. Satisfied with everything else.
577		Great for minor colds and infections. When attempting to get a prescription for a commonly used medication, I was told they could not help and appointment was cancelled.

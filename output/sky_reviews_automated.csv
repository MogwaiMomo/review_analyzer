Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.

I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."

steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"

Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."

Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again.

Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."

Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"

Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off.

No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"

Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"
S M S,9,5,I had a problem but resolved super fast Thankyou Kerri and chloe in customer services
Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do.

I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care

Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"

Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."

Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for.

After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"

Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."

I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"

Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down.

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."

AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"

Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"

Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me.

You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"
S M S,9,5,I had a problem but resolved super fast Thankyou Kerri and chloe in customer services
Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."

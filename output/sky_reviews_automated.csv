Brett,4,2,"First off, their tv, phone, mobile and fibre is pretty good, only a few problems over the last 2 years. What infuriates me is their contract. I had to pay a month in advance, and untill recently was ok with the bills. But even though i was a month ahead, they still cut off my services why I struggled to pay a bill even though I'm a month ahead, also when you do get cut off for no payment they take away the ability to talk to a person about the bill, they just make you go through a automated service where you pay your bill and set up a direct debit again, as they remove the last one, then you can talk to someone. I'm fed up with it, it's illegal as I've already paid but they don't care they still cut you off even though your a month ahead."
Claire,2,5,I can’t fault Sky broadband at all. I went with this provider as they had the best deal at the time. The installation was quick and easy and I never once had my internet service go down in the time I was with them... unlike virgin media who would often have outages lasting days at a time. I had to leave my contact early and it was quick and painless and cost me very little to get out of the contract. The customer service I got over the phone was spot on. Very satisfied customer and won’t hesitate to take out another contract in the future.
Seivar Al-Firqa,1,1,"Avoid this company at all costs! They are a joke. My broadband and TV have not been working throughout January 2021. I have spent 10 hours with Sky over 7 calls. Their ""technical"" team are anything but; simply reading off a script and concluding there is nothing wrong. Ask to complain or speak to management, and they put me back into the end of the queue for same team, twice in a row! It has made working from home during the pandemic impossible. Sky has zero customer service and its just about getting as much money out of you as possible (in my case, got me to upgrade, pay for a booster and an additional Sky box...all to no avail)."
AJ,1,1,"I recently made a complaint to the sky broadband team. With no response I called 6 weeks later to be advised the complaint had been “dealt with by a manager”. No records could be found as as to the complaint outcome, no email or letter generated to me as the complainant, and when i asked to speak to a a manger I was advised they are not able to speak to customers due to COVID working restrictions!!Shambles for a national company. If anyone from sky wants to find out more on how complaints are being disregarded and ignored then please contact me to discussThank you"
Amy,2,1,"Awful, terrible, stressful nightmare. Arranged transfer of services at a new property and was told (incorrectly) that my broadband would be cut off 1 working day before the launch date at the new property. It was cut off a week before and I had to take unpaid leave from work as I was working from home at the time. It is impossible to get any help or to complain to these people. Instead, they just try to sell you a mobile contract. No thanks."
Charles McSweeney,2,1,"I have tried for 3 hours to get BT sport onto my sky account and the customer service is awful. The automated service sends you to an incorrect message and cuts you off. If you try to get to general enquiries it takes ages on hold and then when you get through to a person they ""drop"" your call. Shocking bad service. It is like the old NTL hell!"
A Toth,5,1,0.42 MBps upload speed! That is all you need to know.
Steven Pollok,5,1,"The wife recently bought Sky for various reasons. First problem, the broadband wasn't connected on the day we were supposed to be connected. One 45min call to their call centre later, an Open Reach Engineer was booked. Next the Sky installer arrives and say he can't enter the house to install the sky cabling, so we're expected to do it ourselves. Sky you useless morons need to stop taking customers money when you cannot delivery the service required. Also the installer was a grade A toss pot, he wanted us to clip cables around the outside of the house and around our living room, which is totally unacceptable. The cable could be easily run into the loft space and down the wall into the TV position. All in all our short time with Sky has been completely dissatisfying. We cancelled, we won't be going back ever. Sky will never get a penny out of me. Sky if you improved the quality of the installation service, this incident could have been avoided, and I would have be happy to be a lifelong customer, but you failed at the first hurdle and I am not the only one you've let down. Look at your reviews you should be ashamed of yourselves."
Gareth Garvey,25,5,"I’m really shocked that sky has such a low score on here, I’ve been with sky for a month now, I was with my previous provider for over four years, not because they were good, just because it was the easier and one of the only options at the time, I live in a block of flats and previous company was already coming into the building and to have sky wasn’t very practical at that time, but as advancements have been made, sky fibre is now available direct to my flat, it’s made a huge difference, no line rental cost needed, my Netflix is included, my broadband even though the advertised speeds are far lower than my previous provider, it feels faster, there’s no inconsistency, the router is good, previous one hardly covered the flat, sky one is brilliant, the tv service is excellent, so user friendly, especially after coming from my previous provider, who I firmly believe are stuck in the 90’s, so really enjoying every aspect of sky, oh and did I mention I’m saving £60 a month and I feel like I’m getting far more, this is not even based on offers or deals, just for being in contract with sky, I think the people who are not happy with sky would lose their mind if they went to my previous provider, cos if they don’t like sky, they definitely won’t like my previous provider, but personally I’m loving being with sky at the moment"
Paul,1,1,"Absolute disgrace, daylight robbery, never stop getting on at you, when you leave and do it properly they constantly call to the point it has a effect on you, they won't leave you alone, they lie over charge after leaving over charge when with them, talk to you like dirt, avoid at all costs, anyone having problems call onubudsman and if you have disabilities call scope, they will put you in your grave sky will they do not care and do not abide by there own rules.anyone leaving can leave by letter this allows no calls, if you do it by email you do get a call this is rules, but they constantly ring you and keep charging the full rate after getting a letter to make you ring them, please do not use this company of sad people, send letter of cancellation signed for this gives you proof they have it also copy your letter for yourself this way they cannot get away with the full charges that they keep putting on you for months, you have the proof this way that they break there own rules and proof for solicitor and court.They will also do this to build debt to send to debt collection to get money you don't owe, the proof i mentioned will allow you to dispute with them and take sky court for harassment."
Tom Lally,7,1,"A friend gave me an email and password for Netflix. I used it to login to Netflix, no problem. However, next time I tried switching on my TV, Netflix asked me to login again. I logged in again but this time it said incorrect password.My friend gave me a new email and password, so I used these and logged in to Netflix, no problem. Next time I switched on my TV, I had to login to Netflix again, but this time it said incorrect password.  I phoned Sky and signed up for Netflix with my Sky package. All of a sudden there was no issue with logging into Netflix. This is just a ploy to get you to sign up with Sky to get Netflix."
Carol Mepham,5,2,"New customer with sky have had problems from the start and now have no phone line but cant contact anyone, why is is so difficult to speak to someone when you have a problem with such a big company. Will start looking elsewhere!"
Lisa Mc Ardle,3,1,Absolutely appalling customer service.. currently without landline and internet have contacted them 5 days ago and have since had no response..have spent a total of 4 hours on phone since Saturday and 2 hours this evening only to be cut off..Terrible broadband service..DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY ON ANY LEVEL!!!
Thomas Hall-say,10,1,"We have been with sky a long time but we recently decided to leave after our internet speed dropped significantly. At the start of the contract sky offered a great package but this turned out to be much more expensive than the price they advertised it to us. After giving them plenty of notice to leave, they cancelled our sky Q but not our broadband (we had cancelled both). When asked sky claimed it was our fault, despite us having informed them. Billed us even after we have left, waiting to see if they return the money or not. Highly recommend you avoid!! Just started a new contact with TALK TALK, the internet speed is miles faster and they have been very transparent and fair with pricing."
Jess Lewis-Tatton,7,2,"Been a long time customer of Sky and since WFH it has been a trainwreck. For my work I have to pretty much sit on top of the wifi box (I live in a flat so not as if it’s going into different rooms/floors). I also could no longer get WiFi in my own bedroom. There were many hidden fees that weren’t disclosed and I ended up going into my overdraft since they overcharged us then made excuses for “installation fees” etc. I don’t think I’ve ever paid the price that they promised and that I signed up for. When we moved to another competitor provider, I cancelled well over a month in advance and they still charged me for broadband and claimed it was my fault for not cancelling the direct debit. Odd because they cancelled the TV payment just not broadband, now I have to wait two weeks for a refund. Customer service from Abdul was great and he was friendly! That’s why it’s 2 stars and not 1."
Scott Wojcik,58,1,Sky's FTTP is rubbish FTTC was way better as the ping to online servers on my FTTP is so high.  I phoned sky and they said it's within there parameters. Its FTTP for god sake it's meant to be far better than FTTC!
Michael,2,5,"I spoke with Steve (up in Scotland) about a home move. They was really professional, knowledgable and easy to speak with. It's nice to have some good customer service whilst we're all still adapting to forever changing circumstances."
steven darvill,2,1,Why can’t sky get my broadband working after 3 weeks.Everytime I contact customer services (usual waiting time 50 minutes)they give a different excuse everytime and give false promises.I’ve had enough now it’s time to go elsewhere and they won’t be getting paid any notice either.For a company so large they must have the worst customer services and engineers from any other company I know.Absolutely appalling but the worst thing is they don’t care
John Richard Challenger,23,1,"You record two programmes which are broadcast one after the other.  Lets say programme 1 is the snooker final and programme 2 a travel programme.  You record both programmes on the same channel.  When you decide to watch programme 2, it shows you the last 5 minutes of programme 1 and of course, the winner celebrating.  I have exhausted forums and there is no solution.  WHAT A JOKE.  I did not have this problem with BT.  Once my contract ends I will be going back to BT."
Lisa Scarrott,18,1,Very poor and very unfair I was supposed to have sky q engineer in my home today and he said cant come in the property now I saw amazon prime come in my neighbours flat and did work inside the property. Now why cant sky do that go inside disabled customer home which been completely disinfected cleaned and install sky q box and broadband it's a 10 min job I'm classed as disabled and top piroty I'm not tech savvy and old school I have paid to have sky q fitted and installed so why cant they do the job. My covid free and my flat is spacious and room for the engineer to come in and do his job no excuse for it I find it very strange that he can not install sky q in for me. I was only told yesterday that an engineer would come in my home and do the work it's just complete laziness and very unfair treatment for sky customers who are disabled like myself. They are making every excuse about covid sky come on people like myself are stuck behind 4 walls if they got engineer booked he she should come in and do the work like they are paid to do. Please dont make excuses about covid virus. If I can see virgin media being installed at my neighbours properties then surely sky can get engineers come out and install sky q box and sky broadband and hub your getting money sky. Please dont let customers like myself down
Paco Delgado,4,1,"After 17 years using sky it’s time to leave a total wasted time customer service is diabolical and the waiting time it’s unbelievable today along I benn over two hours trying to get somewhere with sky customer services, as soon as I can get virgin I cancel this sky wasted time"
S M S,9,5,I had a problem but resolved super fast Thankyou Kerri and chloe in customer services
AMANDA & ANDY,10,1,"Unfortunately for me Trust piolet do not do minus numbers and if they did they would not go as low as i would rate sky.Got my mom a cheap contract and 3 months later still over charging and refuse to do anything.Talk about a mulit-billion pound company that would rob an old lady, but at least the gaffers are sitting in there mansions with heating/food not thinking about money during lockdowni will never never ever use sky and recommend you think twice before you do as if i explained how i really feel it would not get this message posted."
Alan Browning,1,1,Appalling presentation of Transfer Day
Tonya Lyon,2,1,Appalling! Charging me extra for no reason and without any notice. I have been charged double today and made to pay someone else's bill on top of the extra charge!!!!
Jonathan,3,1,"Ordered broadband on Dec 29th and was told the earliest they could install was Feb 1st. That date came and no call, text or email. After our time slot had passed we eventually get a call to say there's been an 'issue' and they would need to re book us in........2 WEEKS LATER!!! They couldn't even tell us why as there was no notes on the system, so you cancel a job and you don't know why?? Terrible terrible service."
Al,7,1,"I just don't believe this happened this morning. After being a Sky customer for 20 years and 4 months (I checked with the call centre lady) I have completely changed my mind about Sky customer service. Basically I wanted to cancel my Sky TV subscription so I spoke to somebody in the call centre yesreday and was told that to cancel all my TV stuff would cost £112.99p. I knew I was under contract until October, but that was fine as it still saved me money.Agreed with my wife that's what we'd do and called back today to cancel. Was put through to 'cancellations department' who told me that I could cancel my Sky Sport but couldn't cancel the basic TV package until the contract had expired. The operative told me that she was sorry that I had been 'misinformed' by people who 'didn't have the authority over cancellations'. So is this a complete contradiction, is it a mistake, does one hand of Sky not know what the other is doing (and if not why not), or am I being victimised? I've been in business 40 years never known of a contract you can't buy-out.Or it is Sky running scare of the fact I've bought an Amazon firestick and clinging on to all the customers they can even at the cost of alienating 20 year loyal customers?They need to sort it out."
Fi M,8,1,"Sky App waste of space , can't sign in , they're saying I'm not connected to a network , I'm having to use my mobile data to use other Apps even though in setting it's saying I'm connected to network. In all infuriating 😡"
BOC,2,1,"The service from Sky is appalling.......don't use them, they are just taking your money and provide a terrible service"
Robert Waller,4,1,We have been with Sky for some time now. We have Sky Q in 4 rooms that none stop keep on freezing/crashing. We have tried phoning them up for some help. But we had an Indian guy on the phone that didn’t understand what we where saying and even put the phone down on us today. We have found that they don’t really care about you’re issues and just want to sell you packages that you don’t need in the pass phone calls. If you want a Sky box that keeps freezing on you. That you have to none stop keep on unplugging/replugging the box all the time. Can’t get hold of anyone for help!  -> GO FOR SKY! <-
John,1,1,Worst company of all. Feels like your getting scammed. Virgin media much better
Anne Dromeda,1,1,"Saw was Sky advertising a 'Sale' so phoned (16p per minute phone line) after along wait and they try to cut you off by saying 'is that all for you today' even though you haven't spoken to a person yet. Got through asked if there might be a cheaper package, told there were offers on my account, put through to someone else, he immediately set on about Broadband, I told him I wanted to know about TV packages, he said he would do the fiber Broadband bit first, I tried to explain to him we live down a lane our phone line comes to us on telegraph poles - we do not have fiber, he would not listen and huffed and puffed in irritation at my questioning him. He then set on about a Q Box I explained that we had been offered a Q Box, when the engineer came he said it would be no good for us we have an old house with thick walls, the engineer took the box away. I tried to explain this to the salesman but he just huffed and puffed and ignored what I was trying to tell him. Because after a bit of jiggery pokery I appeared to be saving £10 I agreed to be talked into this, I am aware that this all makes me sound like a silly old woman. I have spent the last three days trying to cancel Sky Broadband, the phone wait has been up to an hour - I've not hung on, emails promise they will respond within 24 hours, they don't. I'm tempted to cancel my subscription altogether, the customer service is so poor. The engineer is supposed to be coming tomorrow - I feel a little alarmed and very foolish at being so bamboozled, as my son said I should have hung up, when the huffing and puffing started because he did not want to listen to me just make a sale."
Ben,6,5,"Been with sky tv for around 2 years at my new home, recently upgraded to multi room skyQ and ultra fast broadband, service I received on the phone was excellent, very helpful very friendly, and found me some great deals to add to my package, for a reasonable price, saving me a lot compared to what Virgin were charging, and giving much more service, so moved fully to sky from Virgin, I get more for my Money and for less."
Joni Mistry,3,3,"Customer Service is poor, prices also high. May switch"
Paula Smith,1,1,"I have had sky Q boxes and they're just cutting off where I can not get back on them. I have been getting 1MG of internet for around 2 years, I have phoned and they've said "" there is a problem however we are sorting it"" and they haven't as they didn't get back to me, the internet is still the same & they're still charging me the same amount of money (£130 - £140 a month). My children are home schooling due to covid and no more than one computer can be used at a time as the internet is that slow leaving them behind on their work. I have 3 sky multi rooms and I can not use them again as they go off when they feel like it especially at night. I will be getting rid of sky now due to the very poor customer service & having to pay for something im not getting, even when I've been with sky for 10 years now. Disappointed!"
mark pearson,2,1,Have been trying to cancel our account for the last 4 days but still no luck have been waiting for the last two hours for an agent it now after 7pm so I'll probably be ignored again as it's getting near to closing time.Will be complaining to ofcom about these clowns 🤡
Iffy Shaikh,4,1,Absolutely rubbish company . If you want to join them they will answer your call straightaway but if you need help with anything then you have to wait up to two hours . I would give them no stars at ll if it had a option . RUBBISH COMPANY . AVOID AVOID AVOID .
Melanie Underwood,2,5,Have just spoken to a lovely girl - I'm an existing customer & wanted to upgrade my broadband - unfortunately fibre isn't available in my area at the moment but I will be upgrading to it as soon as it is - I've saved £28 per month just by making an enquiry call - I did manage to get a small upgrade on my current speed - I work from home and need quicker so will be more than happy to pay the extra when this is available - if this could happen asap I will be ever so grateful
Customer,2,1,"Shocking customer service .Problems with Internet, Passed from department to department speaking to advisers who i struggled to understand most of the time due to  their English . Was on the phone for  2 hours 40 minutes,  Despite being with sky for years, no customer loyalty.  Will definitely be moving to another company when contract ends ."
Stelios,2,1,"The worst call center ever.You have to wait many hours until you speak to human.Really bad experience, avoid if you can."
Dawn Collins,1,5,Had problems with my router connecting to the internet and my sky Q box not working the man on the phone from sky he was called James was excellent he stayed on the phone talked me through every step of the way until it connected cannot thank him enough.
SP,3,4,"I've just left Sky TV as I'm streaming more. It's worth saying though I spoke to 2 excellent reps. We have so many bad experiences with customer service but thanks to Andrew and Jack for being so friendly and professional. Because of them, I'll stay with Sky for phone and bb and upgrade it too. It's such a change to have really friendly staff and I hate ringing customer service. Cheers lads. These little things make a big difference. It also leaves the door open to return if I miss it. I only took off 1 star as the automated phone system asked for my password, didn't understand my accent and said ""thanks, was that all you needed"", oh dear!"
Song God,1,1,During an important price of work my phone wi fi dissconected
Tim MacLachlan,15,1,"Unreliable fibre connection for months!Been getting unreliable fibre server from Sky for 10 months now without any improvement - some days getting 20 outages a day, for a few mins at a time. This is so unacceptable when doing video conferencing and really embarrassing in front of colleagues and customers. Sky refuse to accept it's their fault and keep sending out engineers but the poor service continues. They want to charge £5 for a better router but I just want a basic reliable service for what I am paying for. They now ignore my complaints (as I keep complaining daily at them), and don't want to release me from the contract. I have to suffer another 6 months to the end of contract. I'm now launching a complaint to CEDR to get them to give Sky a kick up their backsides. I will NEVER use SKY again - I was a customer of theirs for over 10 years with Sky TV, but dropped that service, and now dropping them completely. They don't deserve any more of my money"
John,2,1,Cancelling my account after 15 years They just won’t pick up their phones 12 phone calls and can’t get anyone Moving to Virgin TVCan’t wait to see them go out of business
dee Freer,2,1,"If I could give no stars I would. They charged almost double this month as our package was due for renewal. When we called to discuss they offered us a worse package for more money!!! Sky is an absolute joke, appalling customer service, abusing majority market share. During times like these it’s disgusting, they know how much we need internet and entertainment so they abuse their customers and take advantage."
Jamie Wright,2,1,3 times I have emailed sky I have 2 sky boxes NO VIEWING CARD 😡😡😡 customer service disgrace
Phil Davis,30,1,Was persuade to get multiroom and the signal keeps dropping. All I need is a booster and have spent over an hour on three separate occasions with no success.
paul,7,1,Avoid these guys like a plague! There customer service is an absolute joke. They couldn’t make it harder to contact someone when you have a problem if they planned it! Be advised they just want to take the money and run!  Should be shut down
Dritan Lulaj,1,1,"Shameful business. Been with them for over 5 years now and when wanting to remain with them, they were happy to let me go, no offers, nothing from them. Loyalty customers is what a business flourishes from!! So I am leaving them on 2nd of march after my contract ends. They Don't know the meaning of the word loyalty. Money grabbing pigs! New customers be very aware, think twice. Talk Talk are currently doing great offers!! CHECK OUT TALK TALK"
Jas Dhaliwal,3,1,Left sky for another provider. Was told I would be posted an envelope so I could return my hub. Now I'm being told I'll be charged £50...
Pussios,1,1,sky broadband is so bad we just upgraded to a the top fast package and I've tested the WIFI it says its doing 45mbs but its really not its just saying it is please don't buy sky its overrated and pricy you're betting of getting Vodaphone or BT I would like to cancel the contract but you cant its basically a scam and this should be looked into more we have 5 people in the house even when everyone is out of the house except one person the Wi-Fi is still terrible it crashes every 10 seconds my son cant play his games without lagging i cant do my work because it crashes so people don't buy sky Wi-Fi please don't.
Joseph,2,1,"I have just been charged £101.50 by sky Mobile for a 57 min call I have NEVER made to the USA +1872-240-3212 on 01/01/2121 at 01:54. Never been to USA, number not in my contact list, been with them for many years but they still refuse to investigate this OBVIOUS fraud which has now shattered my family finances"
Jane Priceman,2,1,"This has to be the worst company in the UK. The service is like something you would get in adeveloping country.There is virtually no service. Why someone can't give them a serious run for their money I do not know.I am going to complain to Ofcom. Waited 2 weeks for an engineer to come receoiving no signal and when he came he stood on the front door, told us he couldn't come in and left.We had explained the problem on the initial call and they knew they would have to get on the roof to fix the dish but at no time did anyone mention they couldn't enter the house.What a Mickey Mouse company."
Steven Ashforth,17,1,"Want to downgrade my package, however when I click it then the page has expired. I want to call the about this and the wait time in 20 minutes. No options for a call back at a quieter time or anything!"
Taskin,7,1,
Amy Marsh,5,1,Been with sky for over 10 years decided to switch to sky Q what a mistake. It is horrendous constant cutting out. Does not load. Freezes. Can not wait for contract to end. And switch too Virgin.
DM,8,1,"Having been a Sky Customer until 3 years ago (moved to Virgin) after Sky were offering better deals for their new customers than existing and had no concept of loyal customers; I attempted to get a new package as my Virginmedia price has increased. This package was good deal for an 18 month contract and via Top Cashback it had £130.00 cashback deal.  This deal ends tonight.Trying to process the request has not been possible as Sky still hold my old account details and wanted me to log in using details that I no longer have. Rang the contact centre absolute JOKE, 30 min wait asked why they still have my husbands details and that I want to create a new account in my name.  Transferred to new business - queued for 20 mins turns out they were shut, rang back had the same performance by which time it was 19.40 person I spoke to wanted to speak to my husband to confirm account info didn't understand that we shouldn't have an account. Finally caved in and my husband spoke to him to confirm what I had already stated. Asked for a supervisor as the deal ends tonight refused to get me one, said his back office team said the supervisor would only say what he had said. Having been a contact centre Manager this is something that I would not have allowed any member of my team to say.  I appreciate it was nearly the end of his shift but not my problem I had been trying to sort this for over an hour.I will now speak to the ICO as Sky in my opinion are in breach of the GDPR regulations by keeping my data when it is no longer required.I will also log a formal complaint with Sky and submit a DSAR. Regardless of the outcome I will not return to Sky, its my hard earned money and I'm not willing to part with nearly £2000 over 18 months."
Ziad Ghandour,19,1,"absolutely herrendous service. We switched to Q as supposed to be the newest latest and greatest. what a nightmare. Everyday we get all sorts of problems with connectivity, the boxes seeing each other etc. what a miserable service . the fact that no one from this company is bothering to address thier mounting pathetic service should be an indication of how they value us... thier VIP clients! been with them for years, but never seen it so bad"
Alan Worth,1,1,"sky tv, absolutely pathetic, will not connect our sky tv up after moving house because the engineer would have to walk through a lean to utilty room to reach the ariel. Despite having had a gas engineer and boiler repair man working inside the house in the past week  sky engineers are too delicate and precious to even walk through what is effectively an outdoor area with a roof. They expect us to wait until March or April while still charging us, no chance, Virgin media here we come"
Scott s,3,1,Shame I have to click 1 star but no lower choice
Mr Finch,7,1,"Sky quite simply have not got a clue when it comes to their ""sales team"". We have now wasted another day waiting for an install to be told it will not happen until after lockdown (happy to take my money of course). We are going back to Virgin and cancelling with this cowboy operation. Anyone looking to Join Sky think twice as the sales rt=team are incompetent to the point of breaking GDPR rules, would not honour packages promised and now waited 3 day of my life. They should not take any more contract on until lockdown has finished as they cannot honour them. useless, useless, useless..............."
Bailey Walton,2,1,Every single day I work from home the wifi will cut out atleast once The sudden disconnection effects every device in my house AVOID
Jaswinder,44,4,"We've had Sky for more years than I can remember and the customer service on the phone has been efficient, even if you need to press them for issues to be resolved. We've been able to amend/remove products as and when we needed once we get out of contract. Not much flexibility within a binding contract but so far what we have (broadband) has been working as expected. Their router doesn't deliver the strongest signal around the home despite advances in 5Ghz bandwidth so have to use extenders. TV packages although good are quite pricey (for single and multi-room) but at least they have a phone line unlike their shady counterparts NOW TV."
Scott.w,2,5,Declan is a serious asset to your company. He even called me back when he was suppose to finish 30mins earlier to get my issue sorted. Highest level of customer service given by this advisor. Massive thank you!
Customer,2,5,On Friday 22/01/21 I had Craig the sky engineer turn up to install my new sky Q box Although he was not allowed in my property because of Covid I was able to open outside doors for him to   Stay outside to see and do his bit with no danger to either of us .I had a plastic shed in the way of him reaching the sky dish. He emptied the shed and dragged away so he could do his thing to my dish and then put everything thing back in the same place . He was polite knowledgeable helpful and a credit to himself and the  company I would give him 10 stars if I could .Well done Craig and thank you .
Roy W,2,1,"I was with Sky for almost 20 years. Mostly because of apathy. I just kept paying their annual increases. Recently however, I investigated other ways of streaming and other broadband and phone options. Sky broadband gave me very poor download speeds. After hours, waiting to complain on the phone, I was told an engineer would have to call but, because I had been with Sky so lin, I was 'out of contract warranty' and would have to pay £60. So much for 20 years of customer loyalty. That was the last straw. Now, after l have left Sky, I am getting better Broadband, more choice of TV and films tuned to my liking and, all at less than half of what I was paying Sky. Sky do not care for customers. Sky increase prices annually. Sky service is abysmal if indeed you can get hold of them. Sky is only interested in profits and increasing their customer base. After they have you on the hook you just take the poor services and like it. I was so happy to dump them, get a better service and, save money. Don't go to Sky. Search around. Read more reviews, don't just take my word for it."
Steve,19,1,"Why do Sky advertise that they want to look after their VIPs (i.e. all Sky Q TV customers) yet are happy to increase prices without notice or discussion. As a long and loyal customer my bill has just gone up by £30 per month. There main interest when calling them is to sell broadband, Sky mobile and more services! Why would I want to give Sky more money when they treat me so badly.Looks like most people are unhappy with Sky. I wonder how many customer they're losing by upsetting them. When I leave a company I'm gone forever - but Sky don't seem too worried about that for now."
burbage91,4,1,"I had a monthly mobile phone plan with this useless company for the last year and was nothing but trouble since the get go.This week was the end of my contract and couldnt wait to leave. I contacted them and they said we wont cancel the contract and wont renew the agreement either and I am free to go.Days Later they delete my number, which I have had for 8 years and rely on heavily for business, and can never get it back.They then claim they couldn't locate the calI had had with them prior to this. They need to be investigated and this affected my livelihood and cost me money in other aspects now!"
Ashleigh,1,1,"I would give a 0 if possible! WiFi connection is horrific with very poor download speeds. Endless emails with no response, finally got through to somebody after a many attempts and long wait times to actually upgrade our so called VIP package for better speeds. 7 days on, speed is actually slower and no one to speak to about this, you’ll still take our money every month and have the absolute nerve to charge an administration fee just to get an extra kick in. SHAME ON YOU AND YOUR RUBBISH SERVICE SKY!!! Complaint to Ombudsman is the only action left for me."
Customer,2,1,"Every time I call Sky, I am told I am a Sky VIP customer, there is no VIP in it, it simply means I have wasted too much money on Sky!Having had problems with Broadband for over 40 days with internet kept dropping off or stopped working fully, I spent about 15hours on the calls to Sky (at least 10hours waiting on the line), now still I am paying for the not working broadband without any compensation!Sky customer service promises to phone back to follow up the issues, NEVER did! Sky promises to feedback on the complaints, NEVER DID!Sky customer service said, home broadband is not designed for the purpose of working from home, as long as the service is fixed within 30days, Sky is not breaching the contract and I have to pay for early cancellation! They don’t care at all how many of your work calls, meeting are cut off! Now the issues are not fixed for over 40 days, I was told last week that I was eligible for free cancellation, today Sky says, oh, we need to count the days differently because the issues you reported are not on our notes! Sky takes no social responsibilities at all and doesn’t care about customers. There is no shame in providing such low quality service. They simply keep the phone queues 30min-60min long and hope you give up on calling. They don’t allow you to cancel, so you must continue to pay your monthly bills even it’s not working! I have called them 3-4 times, there has been no compensation.Sky uses cancellation fee to hold on to customers and make extra income.Shameful company!Don’t use them!"
Steve,4,1,Been on hold for 50mins!! Not the best way to welcome potential new customers is it. Never again!
Annamae,1,4,"Very good internet, im very happy."
Michael Bower,1,1,"Terrible i cancelled my sky wifi ss changed to someone else,when i rang them to cancel i found they owed me 27.00 they paid me back fine.But then 2 weeks later sky take 93.50 out of my account on my bank account it says sky subscription so i ring to tell them if i cancelled never rang for this and the man on phone couldnt understand me,said i had no registered account with sky,i argued with the man on the phone and he agreed to give the refund,i ring back up today to see where my refund is  a woman answers who cant understand me says they know nothing about any refund being authorised says she cant find the details but shes sure itll be finw and go in i understand your job might be hard but how can you not know you owe someone 93.50."
Pamela Amos,2,5,"I agree with most people on how difficult it is to speak to anyone at Sky but must give credit to Sam who today came to install Sky Q. Though not allowed inside he managed the difficult situation admirably, with clear instructions in everyday language of what we had to do.  Very impressed with his professional, knowledgable and friendly attitude. A real credit to Sky."
Fleur Cowgill,2,1,"Called Sky to try and find a way to save money off my bill - I knew I was in contract until Oct 2021 but times are tight. I wanted to ask what the penalty would be for cancelling Sky sport. The first thing the agent offered me was a free Sky Q box and mini box for multi screen. This would cost me an additional £10! I explained that wasn't the point! Besides which I only have one television. I then discovered that if I took the offer I would be locked in to another 18 month contract. The conversation took 34 minutes of my life that I will never get back and the dialogue was a litany of offers and costs that were really hard to follow - I felt the guy was trying to bamboozle me and blind me with science. The end result is that nothing has changed, other than my opinion of Sky who, previously, I had held in quite high-esteem. All the guy needed to say to me was 'I'm really sorry, your contract runs until October and there is no way I can save you any money'. The agent should not have seen my call as a sales opportunity, but a genuine call to see what help I could get. If the rules say you can't give me any, just tell me."
gary Hammill,2,1,Avoid sky broadband all together. Internet is shocking and you just get fobbed off everytime you phone to get it sorted. Il be glad when my contract is up so I can switch. The routers are rubbish can hardly get signal in other rooms and I’m supposed to be on 80 meg but can’t play online gaming without lagging. Don’t make the same mistake I have. AVOID and go elsewhere.
Tommy Stranack,4,1,"I would recommend everyone avoids buying anything from Sky Mobile. Long story short, had an issue with an iPad purchased from Sky which has been ongoing for nearly 4 months resulting in Sky having the iPad for nearly 2 months. Sky are full of broken promises. They never honour anything they say they will do and even lie to the ombudsman, CISAS, who by the way are completely useless as they have no jurisdiction to enforce anything. Avoid Sky at all costs. Take your custom elsewhere."
David Micklewright,6,1,"Miss sold a mobile phone and no resolve even though they state all calls are recorded.  Absolute shocking service.  Hiding behind Covid not answering calls, everyone else is working, why blame Covid for having to hold hours for calls to be answered.  Customer for 20+ years but doubt I will stay with them."
Sara,2,5,I would highly recommend sky engineer name Tajinder anytime. He cam to install my sky Q boxes. Due to Covid lockdown restrictions he could t come in my property to install but he was very helpful and polite. Was also very patient with me when I was struggling to fix the wires. I would highly recommend him to anyone anytime.Thank you Tajinder.
Richard Collings,3,1,I’ve been on the phone to them for over 2 hours about 3 appointments they did not show for. No broadband for over 1 month. Absolute joke. They’ve gone from brilliant to the worse company I’ve ever dealt with. Each person they lose is a lifetime of sales. Do the math. I’m leaving for good if I ever get through!
James Ross,6,1,"You guys are going to go bankrupt. Worst service, terrible prices. Glad I changed."
David Donnelly,25,1,"I  had no problem with Sky until they sent my renewal at £42 or a new contract at £35. I replied to the email asking for the new contract, but heard nothing. I tried to contact them to no avail, so I looked on the internet and found Plusnet and Now, who would do the same deal for £18 a month. Tried to contact Sky to negotiate, again to no avail. I decided to go with one of the others, but when I looked them up on Trustpilot, the reviews were diabolical. I tried Sky again, spending several hours and using every trick I learned over 40 years as an investigator.Not a crack in the defences, so I decided that if I was going to suffer lousy customer service anyway it would be better to pay £18 for it'.'Luckily""  I was led to EE who did the deal for £27. I would not have switched for £7. I will not do business with people I cannot speak to"
Phill Demoore,1,1,"If I could give sky less than one star I would. Parents moved to them from talktalk (had phone and broadband) should have happened 12th December, given the run around. Promising to call with an update and not calling, blaming openreach, eventually previous supplier disconnected both phone and broadband around 12th jan, promised update 23rd, still no update, say they now may need to visit premises, but need to arrange it, promise to call back. Still no calls. Website support is rubbish. Trying to go somewhere else they want to charge because they no longer have a working line. Parents are in late 70s with one having health problems and no method of communication. This is unacceptable."
AT,2,1,"Rung up as I’d had an email saying my broadband was going up from £25 to £37 as the contract was coming to an end. After being hit with lots of sales pitches for various TV channels and packages they said the best they could do was save me £7 a month and let me have it for £30, I argued saying in that case I could save £37 a month and not renew my contract. Disgusting when people are struggling financially due to covid and need the service to be able to educate their children.Pure greed."
Adam Fairley,3,2,"I have been a sky customer for about 7ish years. My current contract ends next month, so was in the back of my mind to renew. After trying to select the “renew current package” option on both the ap and online - it kept giving an error so I made a mental note to just call them when I had a moment. That call got brought forward as an email caught my attention yesterday - “click here to activate your Sky Netflix account” As I already have a separate Netflix account - I initially thought this was spam. Luckily I checked my sky ap however , and then seen they had automatically renewed my contract AND increased the monthly cost by 68%!(Top tip - if you call the cancellations team you should get out straight through to a human in their Glasgow call centre.)I explained what had happened and instead of an apology got told that they do not notify you of end of account changes as they tell you when you open the account (in my case 7 years ago). I told her, just cancel my account unless you can keep everything the same (or better) as I have been paying all this time. A simple request. We then went round in circles trying to seek me broadband and mobile phones - not listening to my continual saying no! (Agent would not understand why I would not want to change from 900mb to 147mb sky to have everything in one bill!), couldn’t fathom out why I pay less using nowTV vs sky movies etc. So round and round we went, before finally getting my contract renewed to the previous terms. Her helpful suggestion at the end of the call was to set an outlook reminder for 17 months time to check my account. By no means the agents fault - she was as friendly and helpful as could be expected - however - their highly scripted retention process is clearly set up to squeeze every last penny out of customers who’s goodwill is at an all time low!"
Jabir Ahamed,1,1,"This network is a very very bad network that I had,because it's not working good at all.Its very very very very slow"
Tia,2,1,"I love sky, I’ve had it since it came out but gosh it’s awful. I would not recommend. It is very accessible appearance wise, it’s easy to navigate- personally I find it the easiest of any TV box but that’s where the good stuff ends. Subtitles ate absolutely shocking. I can hear but use subtitles as I’m autistic and it makes it a million times easier to understand the words. But I feel awful for the people with no/not much hearing because the subtitles are complete rubbish. Half the time they don’t even work, when they do they slow the show down or it comes way out of sync with what they’re saying, or it just decises it’s gonna crash the show you’re watching. The sky go app is completely inaccessible. No subtitles whatsoever, not even an option to turn them on. Do not recommend at all."
Mikhail Kleptsov,2,1,"I have been a customer for a number of years, and it all went downhill over the past 12 months. Broadband was virtually non-existent, and connection was completely disappearing several times a week (and in the occasions when it did work the connection speed was very feeble). Today, the router stopped working at all. The last straw was the laughable troubleshooting page which suggested that I unplug the router and plug it back in. When that didn’t sort the problem out the website suggested I contact customer service. An automated response suggested that all operators are busy and it will take 45 minutes for anyone to pick up. 45 minutes. On a Saturday. Right. That was the last straw - cancelling my contract with this joke of a company today and switching to a different provider."
Norah Dunne,1,1,"The Sky signal cut out for days on end over the course of several months, leaving us with no TV service for extended periods of time. I spent hours upon hours on the phone and on chat explaining the problem, and lost so much of my time as a result. Eventually they sent an engineer out, who didn't find or fix the problem. I had to get back onto Sky again and again until they sent another engineer out and they eventually located the problem outside of our house. We were offered zero compensation for what was a faulty service provided by Sky; we were only offered a reimbursement for the days we were without the service we were paying for - if we could show proof of this. Appalling service...so so poor, I simply could never recommend them to anyone."
Kevin K,1,1,"Where has all the common sense and customer service gone !!!. I have in 1 week rung sky on 7 occasions to sort out an issue that they created and did not pickup on until i rung them. I have spent approx. 6hrs on the phone waiting or being transferred and still issue not resolved so iv decided just to cancel the bloody lot and go back to BT. What a complete shambles they have become ""SO FRUSTRATING"" Why oh why does it always go to someone working from home in India with a crap phone line as well, the last guy i tried to speak to was having what sounded like a party in the background going on !!"
L Perry,8,1,It is virtually impossible to contact a human being to discuss the details of the account - there is no telephone number displayed on the website.  Bring back humans for customer service - auto bots are not helpful!
Dominc Staussi,1,1,Sky you should look at how you deal and talk to customers very rude.! dont waste your time on hold  to talk to someone for up to 30 mins only had problems with wifi in home sky then said was going to look have to run test told her no you will.say all is ok but we are the ones who live with the bad wifi in the house so the test is not right they dont listen to people who use day in and day out that it is not working sky just hung up the phone!!! Dont waste your time am looking else were am sure I will get a butter service and deal as they can not run customer service centres no one is looking over them so they say and do and tret people bad not even to call back as they hung up i I work for a customer service team and if I had done that I would be pulled up and asked what was j playing at we pay for a service from sky but same old sky they just say and do what they like and want you to pay pay pay for a all round poor service even down to the staff that work for the wifi team poor
Barbara Bates,13,1,"I had my account cancelled when I moved.. stating when I needed the returns package to return the Qbox ... it never arrived. I constantly emailed, tweeted etc giving the new address for them to send the package to. 6 months later after god knows how many emails.. I got a letter saying I owed £104 from an agency. I rang them up told them the story and thought that was it. Anyway again I was bombarded with calls from this company and emails from sky .. eventually I got through to a lovely lady who went straight into the account and could see all my communication and that the contract should have ended July ‘20. She said that this should have been picked up months ago and that at least one of my many emails should have been replied to. The lady was amazing and when she sorted it all .. Sky actually owed me money. She contacted me regularly as promised updating me on the progress And for once she didn’t try and blame it on Covid like others before her . if I haven’t have been in the ball with this issue I would have just paid it thinking that’s what I owed. So the best way forward for anyone is email them then you have copies of all your correspondence... if this had been my elderly mum she’d have worried herself sick over it.. as would many other people"
Dave Annandale,13,1,"Wish we never changed, worst product and service ever.Failed a few days after installation, had to pay to get someone to visit solve the problem. Without extra payment no chance of anyone coming.Lasted a few weeks and then back to square one.It loses connection 5 or 6 times a day. Sometimes for minutes sometimes linger, even a few minutes.To rub salt into the wound  they are taking more than was agreed. Paying for something that has never worked properly almost from day one is bad enough, paying someone to keep fixing it is very poor, and then paying more than the agreed amount is just taking the micky. I wish I had never bothered,"
David. W,2,1,"I would literally rather have a mild form of throat cancer than deal with these toxic mutants again. Vile operational services, vile customer service, vile approach to modern day business. Leaving them is only comparable to leaving an LA gang. Near impossible- without serious injury to your bank account.  They are horrific and should be investigated by their respective governing communications body both nationally and internationally. Shame on them and shame on you if you support them. Go ANYWHERE else for your service."
Jeannette Wells,2,1,"Crooks. Avoid at all costs. Pitiful customer services. Shocking price increases. Company DO NOT automatically put you on the best deal once contract expires. The worst standard of broadband known to man. Second hand TV equipment issued ""as standard"". Worthless clowns whom are now left to count the cost of losing yet ANOTHER customer for life. AVOID AT ALL COSTS......you have been warned x"
Mr Shangruo Wang,8,1,"When I checked the bill today and found out the bill was 10  pounds more than usual. So I rang customer service who strongly deny price increase but discount end. I asked her to explain everything through email because I couldn't quite understand what she was trying to say(a bit accent). She refused. I requested to cancel the whole contract and she said no as the contract won't expire until 22 August.but can degrade sky cinema with charge of 50 pounds. On the bill, the sky cinema is 8 pounds and intially it was free and included as part of the package!!!! To be fair, she was talking politely. But my opinion on sky is totally ridiculous and they are just force you to sign another contract with them otherwise increase the price using all sort of excuses!!!!"
Kim Rainbird,2,5,"I spoke to a wonderful gentleman today at the sky customer support centre. His name was Allister and he truly was so helpful, he went above and beyond to help me and my elderly grandmother in a difficult situation and it meant so very much in world where you don’t always experience such kindness. He really is a credit to sky and the team he works for.Thank you from a very grateful family in lewes."
John Jones,7,1,Unreliable broad band. Had 4 engineer visits still totally unreliable. Trying to get in touch with them is a nightmare it can eat up your whole day. Because of corona virus trying to work from home but it has become impossible. Tried to contact them by email but cannot because it will not accept my landline or mobile numbers and without filling that section in the email will not send. For your own sanity don't go near them
Kayleigh Sharp,2,1,Sky is an absolute joke! Bought a package with them. Told me I’d be waiting 2 months to get it fitted!!! Tried cancelling it been on the phone three times been hung up on every single time!!! Then was on a call with them for over 2 hours being bounced from department to department!!! Can’t cancel everything at once. Absolutely fuming!!! Do not go with them!
Brandon Jay,1,1,"Sky Sky Sky, Where do I start?I checked internet in my area when I moved and it was around 20-35mb... We was told it would be all working when we moved in, Which it wasn't. They told us a engineer would be sent to the box 2 days later... which was then pushed back to the next day. Again, Not engineer went to the box. We called to cancel and they told us the job was cancelled anyway. He said we could get Sky but our internet would be between 3-5mb download which with 3 people in the house who watch Netflix... It would struggle for good quality.They're liars and useless. Would NOT use for Internet."
Arsenal2,16,1,"I have been a Sky customer for twenty odd years and am a black card VIP member but apparently this counts for nothing I tried to upgrade my iPhone from an 11 pro to a 12 pro when it arrived it did not work and would not pick up any WiFi whatsoever I spent 6 hours on the phone to Sky and 4 hours on the phone to Sky neither could get the phone working they said they would send a replacement this took over a month to arrive the new one still did not work so back on the phone they still couldn’t get it to work so for a laugh I asked my 10 year old Grandson if he could get it working to my amazement about five minutes later he said it’s working Grandad and indeed it was apparently the problem was caused by a dodgy iCloud download,with the phone I agreed to swap my 11 for £525 I kept asking for the returns packaging to be sent to be told it had been sent now I’ve traced the footsteps from the sorting office and there are no dead postmen along the way so just another Sky lie they also promised a £20 Tesco voucher for my trouble that has never been forthcoming another Sky lie this morning I phoned to request the packaging to be told my phone was worth £490 I pointed out that he problems had all been at their end but to no avail Sky mobile customer service is non existent they are paid to lie and fob you off,but fortunately I will have the last laugh as I am cancelling all my Sky subscriptions as they come to an end my advice look elsewhere for a good deal with a company that wants your business"
Tanya Erica Biggs,1,1,"Just called in to find out why I'm being over charged since cancellation. Previously when cancelling the agent told me with immediate effect, then when my bill is mounted up I reached out to customer service and was greated by a very argumentative agent that couldn't even speak proper English telling me about a 31 day cooling off period. And my issue was not resolved. How can you keep charging people when they cancel your services? I was not informed about 31 days but I'm not using your services so why am I charged? Very bad customer service when many are going through financial difficulty during covid. I've spoken to debt collectors with more empathy than your agents. Absolutely rubbish service. I will not recommend  sky to anyone. Horrible people and service. And you're definitely not the best provider out there. Service was constantly dropping and internet was not as speedy as many other providers."
Rjn21,37,2,"I’ve been with sky for many years, only for tv. From sky, to sky+, to sky hd, and now to skyQ.Sky HD had eventually become stable, no lip sync issues, no skipping on Ffwd / rwd, very rare box crashes, stable planner, good control app. I changed to skyQ to get 4K and HDR. 4K is only available on some downloads, plus some live F1 coverage and some live football. HDR is a subset of those.The main problem is the v3, HDR compatible Q box. I have the 1TB 32B206 model, ES340d8.It suffers crashes, requiring power off on reboots, roughly every 2 weeks. Both the main and the mini. Lip sync is a major issue, in my case generally (not fully) resolved by using optical direct from skyQ to soundbar and not via HDMI eARC, thereby losing Dolby Atmos.It suffers frequent sound drop outs. Again partially resolved by using optical. I can fully resolve it by using 1080p not 4K, but that entirely defeats the point of Q. It suffers occasional image drop outs where the TV loses the HDMI handshake. That can be resolved by using 1080p, again defeating the point of Q.Sky’s own user forums and other AV forums have several long threads with many users reporting the same issues.Some users are reporting major wifi problems commencing at the same time as the installation of skyQ. Some, but not all, users have reported disabling all power saving settings on the main and all mini boxes has reduced the wifi network spamming issue which can severely affect download speeds. I disabled all box WiFi inc the hidden sky mesh network and use wired connections (albeit then over powerline) direct to my router with no issues. Some users experience problems if the boxes are hard wired to certain types of network switch. Sky customer service generally says they are unaware of any issues. Some CS agents do say sky are aware of the issues, some customers have received a credit equal to the cost of the v3 box / install.Whilst I’m happy to pay the significant cost of the full monthly package, I expect it to work. SkyQ currently does not work for a large number of subscribers."
Abdul Wahab,2,1,I have a very bad experience with sky since my contract starts now since 4 months i am having more issue i report them as well they listen they don’t bother we pay them on time never miss the payment they took the payment but on return give us a nothing broadband connection we pay 30 pound the higgest price but in return get nothing my daughter she have to wait all the times for internet to watch her cartoons i am always using my phone internet so whats the point to get wifi at home if we have to use our mobile internet at the end in one year only one engineer same they spent. Hour and then nothing happens same problem i am very angry on sky team
Rubal Kaur,1,1,Very bad customer service they lie about their product and they try to do fraud with their customers. I wouldn’t suggest anyone sky. Horrible service and very big liers
Harry,10,1,"I had Sky Q and a mini box installed today.Engineers visit.I didn't receive the promised confirmation of visit notification.I was only told when the engineer arrived that they were not allowed to enter the house and the engineer could only work outside and fit a new dish.I had to unpack and connect the boxes to the aerial/wires and set the boxes up with the engineer watching and guiding through a window.I had a good idea what I was doing but I doubt many would have been able to do it.But there was NO warning.Apparently if I hadn't been able to do it I would have had to re-book for a later date when engineers will be  allowed to enter houses.The equipment With Sky+HD we had 2 boxes - we share a house with my sister in law and we had a full box each.Sky+ boxes had output sockets for surround sound, and we were able to output  programmes to our separate bedrooms where we had 'magic eyes' to change channels.Sky Q and the mini-box are connected by WiFi and any programmes my SiL records are also stored on the single main Q box although she can watch them independently.There are no output ports on Sky Q so we have lost surround sound, and there is no output to the bedrooms unless we buy extra mini-boxes at £50 each.BroadbandI have also lost broadband speed.From the Sky speed test I used to get around 35mps although a speed test app on my mobile recorded it at around 28mps.I am not that technically knowledgeable but assumed the 7 mps was being 'used by other WiFi devices. This evening that remained at 35mps on the Skytest but  initially dropped to less than 1mps on my mobile and has only increased to 5mps following a call to Sky.I need to follow up further to find out whether Sky Q is causing the substantial reduction.Not the happiest of customers."
Pete Danbury,2,1,"I joined sky Mobile 5 months ago... after 4 weeks had issue with my new s10 phone... call after call after call to sky mobile as they advised they will call but never did... took 5 months to get my phone repaired. I did all the chasing, I packed my phone and posted it to repair centre.... Customer service and the whole Sky Mobile is a disgrace, they are a joke..... after months of me paying my bills with phone that didn't work properly, they would only offer £15 compensation... absolute joke, There service is awful.... Avoid Sky Mobile..........."
Tanbir,1,1,Sky has the worst wifi ever. I don’t care what anyone says but sky wifi is the worst. It’s so slow and sky if your reading this stop lying to your customers. Sky says that there wifi is so fast and excellent but it’s not there wifi is so Fing s**t . F*c*you sky lying out here to get peoples money. I will. Sue sky one day for lying to all there customers. I hope you read this sky because you owe all your customers a refund
Nick Musk,2,1,"Existing long standing SKY customer wanting to upgrade from an old HD box to SKY Q and Signature package. They want to charge me £99 to fit the box, but if i were a new customer I could get it installed for £20. Adviser on the phone said he could do nothing about it other than add me more monthly packages with monthly charges and then the initial install would cost less. No thanks as it doesn't look like you need me as a customer and i'll look elsewhere for my TV viewing."
Lachlan Mactavish,11,1,"I just spoke to a Sky operative who was very helpful but I have to wait and see if the problem is resolved.I swapped a 6 month old Huawei p40 pro mobile phone in perfect condition because I found it more and more difficult to use without Google apps. Sky offered 275 pounds for the phone, scandalous but I accepted.After the swap I received an email confirming receipt of my cell phone which indicated ""as agreed"" instead of the 275 pounds they were offering 55 pounds as the phone was damaged. The problem was there was no agreement as they confirmed the phone was in good condition.The Sky operative spoke to the relative department that stated: the problem was a glitch in the system!!!This so called glitch was already known to Sky but notwithstanding this they sent who knows how many emails with the same problem without taking any action. I was advised I will hear within 72 hours the result of my call.I wait with bated breath the response . I'll post the result."
Andrew Pennells,3,5,"My main Sky Q box broke down last night at 9pm. A new one was delivered at 12.30 today. Great service Sky, well done."
HAROLD ISAAMAN,23,5,i have just sighned a 18 moth contract with sky the young lady whos name was miriam and lives in Newcastle was a diamond so polite even helped my wife set up her tablet there was no panic and it was a pleasure to speak to such a polite young lady you don't get this type of person working for virgin media that's why I took a new contract with sky miriam deserves 10 stars well done sky.
RICHARD BONSER,1,1,"If I could give no stars I would.Its impossible to get hold of anyone.You cant email anyone, live chat anyone, all you can do is ring the number they give you with a one hour wait.Dont know how they get away with such a dire service.Please go with somebody else, or you will regret it,they really are that bad,please look at the other revues,everybody cant be wrong."
J Bhill,15,1,"I have been with sky on a TV package only, for 14 years. All that time, I had no complaints, occasional glitches, but mostly HD Sky box worked. I even had it replaced free of charge though I never asked for a new box. We are moving house next month, so I tried to arrange for sky to be supplied at the new house. Then the fun starts, they tried to sell me all kinds of addons, but still I couldn't get an answer if they will fit the system. It transpires, that can come and fit the dish, but cant come into the house to set it up!!! I will have to do that! after going back and forth, we decided to cancel our sky package.... fortunately I was on their message service, but 31/2 hours later I managed to cancel my sky. I have never know such a company that makes cancelling a service so difficult. After reading other people’s experiences I think I am going to try BT tv, as see how they are. Sad to think after 14 years, they wont fix the unit inside the house, due to covid restrictions. We could sit in another room, and wear mask while they do their work, other companies do it. What if i was a 90 year old person, would they still expect me to set up the box on my own? What poor customer service."
Jade Forster,1,5,"I have just moved to sky from Virgin after a terrible service the past 2 years (i wish I had done it sooner!! Virgin were AWFUL!) Overall the whole experience has been very pleasant. Easy to sign up online, Advisor I spoke to was great. Broadband and TV installed on time, Engineers turned up within timescale. The sky engineer Anthony covering Stevenage, Herts area was brilliant and was very very helpful. Please pass onMy thanks! Thank you for a great customer experience SKY. :)"
Luke Hughes,31,1,"What a load of sh%t! 82% 1 star reviews and counting. No wonder they are getting smashed by BT!I said to my partner, don't make us get sky, they are so bad at communication, history of ripping customers off amongst other shamefully poor service they provide.....Don't worry, Sky didn't disappoint! They like to live up their woeful reputation and somehow, (if its possible) make it worse, thats actually hard to do.Booked to get sky fitted and they cancelled the appt on the morning, despite it being booked a month in advance. Re-booked it, then despite three calls of clarifying that they will 100% be coming, you guessed it, they couldn't be bothered to show.Well, there is one positive....my partner has now agreed they are load of Sh%t too and we will be taking our business elsewhere."
Lorraine Sciberras,1,1,"Terrible man turned up this morning didn't even come in the gate, said I'm sorry can not do it my dad asked why its the wiring, what, he already had sky 2years ago s he showed him sorry be back in 2weeks, rang up to complain they said next insulation is 1st March, my dad is nearly 90 distrusting behaviour, end of"
David James Curry,2,5,"Last night having trouble with my sky Q box. Spoke with Meggie. (She was from Bulgaria) and part of the technical team. Very professional, helpful and fixed my problem. Sky are lucky to have her as a employee. Thank you Meggie."
Jackie Jones,7,1,"Disgusting service, no help when needed, talking to answer machines, broadband always playing up, would not recommend to anyone"
DEBBIE STANDEN,1,1,I am completely appalled  of the service that sky is giving to my father he applied for tv broadband and home phone on thev14th October he has stillnot had this service complete or installed and has had several engineers out and the latest this morning saying its fine and drove offMy dad needs to get this service completed he needs access to email for a hospital in London this is really not the service I expect we have tried calling sky and the last update washcloth novemberv2020 and we were told it would be completed 22/12/2020 we are now 20 January 21 i want action and reasons why this is not completed and a human being to talk to me before I take this to my solicitor or to the papers
double menthol,1,1,"I wouldnt recommend sky tv to anybody, all repeats and to expensive, I'm so happy I left, more money in my pocket.🤑😉"
Gary Forster,1,2,I have the so called best broadband and every channel.  With a sky Q booster.   Can’t watch anything upstairs.   Pointless.  Then the system sometimes decides we haven’t upgraded channels.     It’s like going back in time to the early 90’s.  Awful.    Then you can’t speak with anyone for over an hour.   Total rubbish
Glen,1,5,"I cannot under these reviews! Nothing wrong with this, Company at all - Customer Service- Team are fantastic and signal and overall - Service is better than any - other, Network - I’ve dealt with.Keep up the good work, Sky - Team - it’s fantastic"
AMac,1,1,"Quite difficult to even find the number to contact when you have a problem. Which is particularly frustrating because you can't seem to do anything productive on Sky's website - in my case, buy a Sky WiFi Booster. Spent 45 minutes on hold to buy one because the Wifi barely stretches beyond two rooms - finally got through to somebody and, after 15 minutes of trying to buy the booster, was put on hold while she tried to figure out how to do it. Then she put the phone down on me. So over an hour of wasted time and energy. Still have poor Wifi with no solution to be had unless I fancy another hour of on-hold music and my blood slowly boiling with impatience and other people's incompetence. I also was ""upgraded"" to Sky Q but I can't access it because they're not sure there is the right satellite on my block and they can't be bothered sending anyone round to check (this was pre-COVID so no excuses there). Therefore also impossible to get Sky Q. Time wasters. Get fibre wherever possible."
Ian Elwell,7,1,Awful Customer Service. They intentionally make it as difficult as possible to contact them. Unless you want to cancel of course when all of a sudden a phone number appears.Don't bother with the online chat support. Awfully slow and painful process with someone who clearly doesn't speak English as a first language and isn't allowed to deviate from prescribed scripts.  Their only interest is trying to up-sell rather than help. Most of their prescribed scripts don't make any sense either.Currently on hold waiting for their technical team. Even on this line they tried to push me off the call and back to their website.
Anita Jones,3,5,Our internet wasn’t working. We had a sky engineer come to the house and he replaced the wiring.  The Internet is now working really well.  He was very professional and cleaned up after himself leaving the place very clean. He did a brilliant job and we were very impressed with the engineer he is differently a real credit to sky.
Lou,3,1,"Dont bother with Sky TV, what a load of rubbish! More entertaining watching subscription services ...and cheaper! They want to double our bill and end our contract 2 months early because we moved! Bunch of scammers."
Andy McFadden,1,1,"I tried  to get super fast broadband,got an email confirming conection and price,then an text saying it was cancelled, now paying more for the service i had before i tried to upgrade, useless company, dont deserve any stars."
Scooby Doo,5,1,"It doesn't even deserve 1 star. Worse provider I've ever had. The Q box is rubbish. Always a problem. Catch up stops displaying the latest episodes, all the programs you can and can't watch (because you're not subscribe) are mixed together so you spend ages scrolling through to realise the one you chose you can't watch. You have to select standard definition to watch a lot of programs which is stupid and another few steps everything you want to watch something and if you want to catch up on a series they show the oldest ones first so you have to scroll all the way down to the bottom through weeks worth to find your latest episode. Landline is usually static as its through WiFi (stupid me didn't realise when signing up) and I often have no signal, mobile i barely get one bar. Turning on the TV every morning takes three buttons with pauses between each one just to get normal TV on and the stupid programs all have silly numbers so 1 is 101 and 3 catch up is 203 instead of 33. Very confusing. Cant wait to leave. Always a technical problem to solve and a stupid automated voice when you call the helpline which can't understand what you say and when you do get through you get sent a link to your mobile to troubleshoot before they will talk to you. When you do get through to someone though they're pretty good but just finally got through to someone who took my name and yep the line went static. I absolutely hate Sky. Had thought they had a good reputation but they are on par with Talk Talk which is saying something"
Deborah,6,1,"sky sends engineer to sort out property on our group of flats only 6 of us he cuts everyone of doesnt tell anyone when i get hold of hes so rude it is what it is .always been trouble they failed when built to put cabling in correctly,so no sky ,then failed to up date dish to be able to use ,then just cut everyones tv off disgusting"
Mike Percival,9,5,"Just spoken to Melanie in the Sky help centre. She sorted the mini boxes freezing in an efficient and positive way. She was helpful, friendly and her instructions were very clear and easy to follow.I have to admit getting through to a person took a long time, but if you ignore all the requests for information that the recorded voice asks for, you eventually get put in a queue for a human!"
AndroidGames,1,1,Trash hope sky dies i swear to god worst thing ever!!!!!
Marko Maslakovic,1,1,Avoid like the plague. They are great when they are selling something to you - but when it comes to them fulfilling their responsibilities forget about it. Pure scum.
Phil G,21,1,
Davy Rogerson,1,1,I have been waiting 12 days to get my inner net fixed  2 open rench engineer and 1 engineer  that  did not turn up  I have to 3 days of my work about 8  hours  on the phone                        Engineer booked for tomorrow we will see
Customer  Stephen Crainie,28,5,"Joined on 8th December and contacted sky a couple of times, before install and were very helpful broadband not installed on 8th due to pole issue sky credit my account after it was installed on 22nd couple of issues with the second box and again when I called very helpful and sent a new remote so I must say they have been great with me and I loonforeard to lots more great customer service"
James Winter,3,1,"It’s a shame you can’t score less than 1 star. It’s difficult to rate customer service when there is none. First contacted them on the 18th Dec with a WiFi issue.. we’ve had several engineers visit & lied to many times when saying they would be calling & they just didn’t turn up. Eventually someone did call on 30th December to try & resolve & installed a new line. This lasted until the 11th Jan & then packed up again. Another engineer called to resolve & got it working briefly again & guess what it’s now stopped working again. For the price you pay you expect a good service & if you do have issues, a good customer service. Unfortunately you don’t get either."
sue evans,31,1,"One of the biggest companies in the country and they cant send out trained engineers to fit sky. The first 2 people couldn't find a cable (didn't need to find it because it was already installed) another appointment made and the second engineer comes without the required tools and then cant enter house anyway because of covid. Sort it out sky, other companies are letting engineers work and enter peoples homes if they are happy to do that but sky book appointments and pay engineers to just say sorry we cant do that because we cant enter your home, why book the appointment in the first place. I presume people who answer the phones are working from home but hours to connect to someone who can help, maybe their employees are with sky phone and cant connect"
SM,1,1,"Worst Customer Service I’ve ever experienced!! To be honest Sky do not even deserve 1 star! It's really disappointing to hear that my order for Broadband Boost, Sky Broadband Superfast has been delayed again! After placing the order on 21st December, there was no mention of the possibility of any delays due to BT! To make the matter worse, I have received the following via text!That this is now delayed again and I'll get an update on the 21/01/21 and it's all BT's fault and sky can do nothing about it! Then using the text number provided by Sky... I get this message!! Hi it’s Sky, this number is no longer in use. You can still reach one of our Messaging experts by texting 07786200623. This message has not been delivered.Hi and welcome to Sky. We're sorry, but our Messaging Service is currently closed. We're prioritising customers who need extra care or have been to sky.com already, so wait times may well be longer. The fastest way to resolve most queries is online at sky through our My Sky App or on your Sky box.Then our waitress of the blue... another text message saying... Unfortunately we are unable to complete your order. Please contact us at 03442 410046 to discuss furtherPhone calls so far - Monday 11th January - 52 minutes - no answers.Thursday 14th January - 1hr 31mins - told order cancelledI can ring on the 28th to find out if there’s available fibre, not you call me! I have a contract that doesn’t seem to apply on your part.No managers available to speak to me for 4 days! 143 minutes on calls and no success! And after all of this... I now see my order has been dropped by Sky! Not me, I want my order to stand and I want the service, and yep they’ve dropped it and even told me to try another provider!! Heaven help us!!!!"
K Mak,1,1,"Way too expensive, when they give a better deal they just raise the price again without warning. Every channel constantly playing old repeats. Internet is an absolute shambles. You never get the high speed internet as they claim. If your satellite dish hasn't been installed in the correct area you can forget getting signal when windy or raining. When you call them out for anything they don't turn up. Do not go with sky there are far more better options. Been with these guys over 10 years and it's gotten worse. It's no wonder all my family and friends are telling me to cancel and come over to virgin.Time to cancel. Don't waste your money on this provider"
john ginty,7,1,After many years been away from sky my misses decided she would like it get it so we looked what channels we wanted etc and booked the installation costing me .. the sky man came and refused to install it because there wasn't holes already drilled for him .. I asked if he had a drill bit I would drill my own hole he said he can't do that so in reality sky are sending people out to refuse to install sky because there's no pre drilled holes...... they charged me to fit sky lol yes we in lockdown but why don't they state we will not drill no holes so you're chance of getting sky are very very slim complete scam to get as much money as possible us as the customer mean nothing to this company so now I have had to rebook the installation and have my own holes drilled ready for the sky man to poke his wires through then I set my own box up ( I charge £150 ) installation fee tho
EMILY TAYLOR,2,1,The worst broadband i have ever had rang over 5 times and each time done nothing about it and keep sending the wrong engineer out! absolute joke a company!!
D Castaldi,2,1,"Shocking , shocking, shocking. Constantly underperforming broadband. They made an appointment with me to have an engineer come to the house, gave me a time slot and went through the COVID-19 procedures. No engineer turned up, no phone call and another 45 min wait on the phone as I try to understand what is going on. They then said that the reason for the no show was due to the engineer not being able to enter the house due to COVID! Sent a complaint in by email no response. £120 per month - what a disgrace"
David Gibson,3,1,I wish I could score zero. I am a vulnerable person self isolating alone following a heart attack and suffering with diabetes and ptsd. Sky reatened to cut me off and threatened fines and breech of contract after I told them they were wrong. They left me with no money for food and basics this weekend after promising me a call back to resolve the issue[s]. They are wrong and I told them listening to previous customer service calls would prove me right. Yhey have had circa £20k from me as a loyal customer and treat me like this.
JR,2,1,"I've been a Sky Fibre broadband customer for nearly 4 years. When originally ordered, I was getting 28 / 36 Meg available... my initial contract ran out and I was offered a potential 63 Meg faster fibre broadband ... this has been fitted and I only get 24 Meg :(Called sky which took over 47 minutes to get through to a person, to be told, the maximum speed for your property is 18-27 Meg and because you're getting 24, that speed is ok and we will not send out an engineer - lousy customer service - I will cancel the whole Sky service as soon as a credible alternative becomes available.My neighbour has faster fibre broadband but with BT , the same router type, the same cable in the street up to the cabinet - he's getting 40 Meg."
Chloe Evans,3,1,"My family have recently moved from virgin to sky and the engineer was meant to come today between 1 and 5, my mom comes back and we have a card off them saying we missed the appointment but the engineer didn't knock the door, we told them a month ago to not use the first door or the doorbell as they didn't work and the first door isn't our front door. we have been on the phone to them and now we have to wait another 2 weeks for them to respond to our request. Every tv company in this country is just a joke."
Shaun,5,1,Terrible service I joined sky on the 8th of August 2020 and from that date on I had nothing but trouble with my phone and broadband terrible speeds phone was hit and miss when it actually worked.I then tried to cancel in October it took then 5 months to close down my account and now they over 700 out of pocket thanks to the complaints team who made sure I had 300 in cash and free cancellation on all my services
imran smookin,3,1,One of the worse service provider. Trying to buy plan from iPhone 12 pro. Been refused by saying such a shift credit company called ecoflex refused credit history. I bought new house and my credit history is the best. Avoid sky and ecoflex if you want credit history perfect
koyrulp islam,3,1,
Mehmet Mahmut,22,1,"Bad customer service. I phoned to say that sky have the have made a mistake having the wrong address even though they have the correct post code.We have 2 different buildings on my street with No:1I rang before the install is done on the 16/01/2021 I was informed by a sky rep that hey can not change the address even though you have the correct post code, and only had 2 options was either let the engineer decide if he or she will do the install on the 16 Jan 21 or cancel and rebook with correct address.This is how you treat new customer's you can not even change the address to correspond with my post code so instead I have cancelled completely before the install....!  NOT MY LOSE"
David Gardner,24,5,"I rang them up to discuss some issues on at my property.   The customer service lady noticed I was out of contract and ran me through some new options that gave me everything I have now for a reduction of £40 PER MONTH.   We really enjoy the service so that was really nice (we have 5 Sky Minis, all TV options and broadband).For the reason I actually called about, I was sent a new router and replacement mini Q box and a Sky engineer is visiting soon to hard wire one box that is struggling with wifi.Really happy with everything they have done."
Yv,2,5,"I had an issue with broadband speed and a crackling/buzzing phone so rang Sky.  I was helped by a very polite and friendly operator called Gemma who looked into my problem and then said she could get an engineer out the next day.  However, that didn't suit, so he came the next day.  I think his name was Kevin, and he too was extremely helpful and polite, spending about 6 hours at our property and in the local area to sort us out.I have just spoken to Sky again, on another matter and once again a very professional and friendly operative, Lauren, was able to deal with my query.Many thanks to all of you."
jediexodus,1,1,"Very disappointed with Sky TV we haveBeen with them for years they try to push sky Q on you then keep interrupting the your service which your paying for, then you have to phone up to get it reset... very long phone calls, last time I called I was put on hold and no one came back, left on hold - after being on the phone for an hour I gave up... very very bad customer service... avoid sky at all costs try virgin or BT instead... we will be leaving sky at the earliest opportunity... shambolic"
Maurizio & Ann Marie,8,5,I have great experience on landlines and broadband and I have understood that service and speed is not about the company you go with but has to do with bt (openreach) they own the line So I was with talk talk good company was I am with sky and I great too so what I am try to say for those who leaves bad review to sky is wrong as they don't own the line so if the line is a crap the speed would be bad with whoever you go but I can assure virgin is really bad high price bad service big liar customer service I hope this review help but to me sky best company so far as customer service
Chloe C,1,1,SKY IS THE WORST. INTERNET. EVER. I have to use my data in my own house as my wifi only works when I am in my living room next to the router. It is so frustrating and personally I think I should be payed compensation for this traumatic time.  Also I only have like 4gb of data a month and I HAVE TO USE IT IN MY HOUSE. It is ridiculous.
Nat,7,1,"Recently switched to sky mobile from EE. Ordered my phone, got it the next day. Phone had a fault. Rang customer services after speaking to an idiot bot who couldn’t understand my Yes & No. Abusive snappy man I got put through to. Basically called me a liar and asked for proof. I literally got the phone 10 mins earlier in the post. Been on the phone for 3 hours with them. Trying to cancel my PAC request to keep my same number. I’m not staying with SKY. I’m terminated my contract as I don’t like how I was treat and would rather give my money to a better more respectable company. Wasn’t even with them for 24 hours. Let this be a warning to you before you decide to switch to them."
Steve Harvey,1,1,I have just upgraded my standard sky broadband to fibre sky broadband. On the day it was activated I discovered my telephone number had been changed and missed a call from my doctors. After two call to sky the following day I was promised someone would attend the following day to correct their mistake. As you can guess no one turned up. Another 40 minutes on hold to be told it was going to take 3 to 5 days before someone would attend to put their mistake right. Sky customer service is appalling. When you make a mistake do you not try to correct it not put it to the bottom of the list of things to do.The text I have just received still insisted it is a fault when someone who changed the broadband over made a mistake. Talking to their call handlers is like talking to a record list of answers they can not understand what you tell them or solve a problem. Goodbye skyQuick update the number they changed me to is someone else's number and I am know getting their phone calls.
Andy Trott,2,1,"The service Sky provide can only be put quite simply as shocking! If any one is considering signing up to one of there packages I'd urge them to reconsider, I've had more failed attempts by engineers (who don't seem to have a clue) than I've had hot dinners recently, The TV keeps cutting out, the wifi is intermittent and now even my land line has stopped working after the last engineer decided to dismantle the phone sockets as they where causing interference with the signal?As per usual the customary 30-40 minute phone call on hold awaits before you meet the obligatory raft of excuses......!Roll on Virgin, BT or any other provider, anything has to be an improvement over this shower..........."
Want.not.get.not,1,1,"Absolute  joke. Instalation ment to of been start of December and still  not. Been waiting  for broadband to be fitted over  a month, so tv package doesn't work because it needs Internet.and still getting  charged for it. Get less channels then freview. If i didn't pair my sky card on the Internet with phones Internet id still have no channels.. 6 weeks down the line and numerous calls still cant be told a date when my broadband will be fitted"
Chel,5,4,"I signed up to Sky about a week ago with a helpful agent. She walked me through the process and offered great packages that offer value for money by adding on extras and like most people, i got excited, bought into the dream and agreed to the package. However, upon review there are add ons that dont really add value to my situation (i.e Signature, sports & cinema). So I called up with the intent to cancel the add ons and keep just the broadband. I spoke to a very patient and helpful gentleman, Dave Sheen, who asked genuine questions to completely understand my thought process. This, I believe, is the real definition of customer service. He didn't act like a rep but rather as a consultant to ensure that get the best value for my money and that i was completely happy with what i was agreeing to.I decided to keep the package as is thanks to Dave. Sky, give that man a bells and a raise! Dave thank you for your consultancy and most importantly, your integrity! I look forward to seeing what Sky has to offer. :)"
Dee,2,5,"I phoned sky to see if I could upgrade my package, the lady I spoke to was lovely, polite and helpful. She asked lots of questions to make sure the TV package was right for me, also found me discounts and had a great conversation inbetween, due to have it installed tomorrow, had a call from an engineer yesterday who confirmed this with me who was also very helpful. I have had broadband and phoneline with them for 2 years now and never had any complaints."
James Pritchard,1,1,Sky internet is quite possibly one of the worst services I have ever purchased in my entire life. It’s disgustingly bad.I’ve not had a consistent internet connection for months and it’s always slower than advertised.Not only that but every time I try to get help I go through the same circles with machines and nothing ever gets resolved.I’m going to try and get out of my contract as soon as physically possible.
Andzia Sak,1,1,"Absolutely rubbish! I am VIP customer which have been with sky for a year's. My broadband do not work properly since October. I am work from home, well I try to work but is difficult without broadband!!!!!!They force me to change a contacts to get even faster ! Bull**** !!!!! Not working at all. You want to take only the money. Will moving out from you asap !"
Mrs E. Chukwuemeka,2,2,"Upgraded to sky Q on the 24th of Nov 20 scheduled for the 2nd of Jan which I felt was excessive but anyway, then I had a call a few days before the 2nd to ask if I wanted it sooner, I said yes and it was due to be installed in the 30th of Dec. The 30th came and I suddenly got a call saying that the installation wouldn't be happening on the 30th due to an error and the next available date was the 7th of Feb. After much complaining they managed to move it on the 26th of Jan, which I still think is too long. It shouldn't take almost 4 months just to have sky tv installed."
Astrid McElwaine,4,1,I recently asked & am paying for an upgrade to my Sky Broadband & it is much worse than before I changed. I am not technical & just need it to work so requiring me to faff about with their equipment in the middle of my working day because it has yet again failed is not good enough & they don’t even make it easy to get it sorted as you need to sit in a queue for 20mins only to be hung up on my a stroppy operative. Not happy
Andrew,1,5,"I would like to state that two members of sky were extremely helpful for me today Danny from the cancellation team and pan fro the tech support, I had an issue where I wasn't getting the services I pay for, I was spoken to professionally and calmly by both these operators and I am grateful for helping me resolve the situation without me having to end my contract with sky"
Disgruntled Dave,1,1,"Wow - took 1 hour 25 minutes on my second call to them yesterday and went to billing, to tech support and finally to cancellations.  What I wanted to say is the people that dealt with my call were all exceptional and so professional and are COMPLETELY let down by the system.  To get to speak to someone, I was on hold a total of two plus hours.  That is just not good enough.I was initially swayed by the price, but to be honest if there isn't a service to match then I am not going to switch to SKY.  I was calling on behalf of my mum who is 82 and there is no way she would have even navigated the complex automated service at the beginning.Poor Poor Poor and so sad that we put up with these types of companies taking the you know what out of us.  Two hours of my life wasted Sky!"
lucie,2,1,"Been with sky about 4 year but the past 10 months or so have been one problem after another. Super slow broadband that constantly cuts out baring in mind schools are shut so the kids are homeschooling which is all online and now we have to wait three weeks to be upgraded to fibre. The sky Q box randomly decides to disconnect from the internet and then you have to go through a range of annoying tasks to try get it connected again including turning the box on and off, removing the viewing card and putting it back, manually going through the  connection settings on the box, holding your breath for an hour while smacking yourself round the face and sacrificing a small child. Your bill ( despite your services not changing) randomly goes up with no explanation and god forbid you try and speak to anyone on the phone you are either met with a braindead robot or brain dead person not much difference and neither are any help whatsoever."
Kelly Raven,14,1,"End of contract came around, (I was looking forward to this as my situation had changed and I needed the contract to end in order to be able to afford basic necessities) and with no warning my £40 bill became £73. I didn't consent to my contract being auto renewed so I was shocked. When I contacted them I they refused to do anything about this bill OR the next one, claiming I needed to give 30 days notice to cancel. Eventually I let the crazy bill go and explained that if I have to pay an extra £33 the NEXT month I would not be able to afford groceries... at all, but they absolutely refused to budge despite having the power to do so and me not having requested a new contract or even consented to an auto renewal. I used the service up until the last date of that month and disconnected everything the day before the next payment period, so I did not use any services I hadn't paid for. Over a year later, and they have sold that £70 debt and I'm constantly harrassed by debt collectors. They are an evil company with horrible customer care."
Andrew,5,1,"At first we had a problem with the synopsis not displaying, and the second signal on the sky box 'not locked'  The engineer that called said we didn't need a second cable for the second signal, and removed it. They said we had a faulty aerial port coming through the wall.  When they left, we discovered the sky box was unable to record 1 programme, and watch another.  And would only record the channel being watched. Found out the 'single feed' mode had been turned off.2nd engineer that came to fix that, refused to enter the house, and would only instruct through the window.  Said the problems would be unable to be fixed for months due to the pandemic, and left without fixing it. We had an independent engineer to come out today, who reinstalled both cables, fixed the hard drive recording and signal locking problems, and left within 10 mins."
Manjit K Sandhu,2,1,"I tried on Friday to get hold of Sky to cancel, I waited nearly an hour no luck.  I then tried online via online chatter, the person could not help online because my password asked confusing because it said it's not the one you login with or set up.  Trying again today, I am still waiting.  When you sign up, you can do it online and enter all the payment details, no questions asked.  When trying to cancel you have to phone and answer... obviously you are happy to take on new business without phoning in but to cancel you cannot be bothered to answer or help online"
L Hughes,11,1,"Have been trying to contact sky for days to alter the account from which they receive payment, plus my email details. A simple enough task for most. But all sky can do is ignore the request, place one DELIBERATELY on a carousel of id**ts trained to “not understand” simple questions, & to put one back on the carousel to wait another 20/50 mins until one loses the will to live. They therefore make twenty phone calls last all shift whilst not accomplishing any proper work."
Charlotte Willes,1,1,"For the past two years I have had constant trouble with my broad band . Extremely slow and hardly ever works (yet funnily enough works when I need to use Sky catch up and box office  ). I have upgraded to fibre and had a number of engineers sent out. The last engineer was extremely rude to my grand father and I was furious when I heard the things he has said to him. Then I called Friday evening to finally find a resolution to this broad band issue , and the lady I spoke with was rather rude, abrupt and not really that helpful. She made me feel like I was a burden calling. After over an hour phone call, still no luck with the broad band."
Gary Dow,8,1,My mother in law called Sky mobile to ask for a new sim as she is on a sim only deal and purchased a new phone.Her current sim will not fit her new phone The guy she got through too at Sky Mobile was quite reluctant to complete this quite straight forward task.He waffled on about how he might not be able to do this and how she should take out a deal on a Samsung galaxy tablet for 4 year.After telling this Sky mobile operator that she wasn’t interested he then began to ask how much she paid for her new phone.After 30 mins of haggling the sim was eventually ordered.Beyond belief and extremely unprofessional sales tactics when all that was required was a simple SIM card.I would avoid this company at all costs as there is far better and more professional company’s out there that won’t waste your time.Very poor from Sky mobile
Manon van Thorenburg,1,1,"It has taken three hours to cancel my Sky contract, and I have been asked 5 times whether I want to bring Sky to my address.  Absolutely ridiculous - if people wanted to stay on Sky, they would. Asking them 5 times, and taking up someone's entire afternoon to cancel a subscription isn't going to make them stay."

Tyrone Nightingale,1,1,Very disappointed with sky mobile they accepted you to join sky mobile contract then take it away from think they need to think about what they doing because they messing with people emotions by getting there hope up and then turn them down
Iulian Antohe,2,1,"Rip off and very expensive.  We are paying over £30 a month and the quality of the picture is rubbish . Definitely is not HD as they saying.   I am running a dts 7.2 Yamaha amp and you can see the difference between watching a movie on Netflix,Prime and Sky."
Jakub Barzal,1,1,"Terrible service and customer service aswell, internet rarely works and every week there is another problem and when you call them up u have to wait for over an hour to even speak to someone after answering a million of questions to an automated service, if you ever get a chance to speak to an adviser its usually a matter of a week for someone to come in and have a look why the broadband you are paying for is not working"
Linda Lawlor,1,1,Tought sky were great happy with all that was subscribed but when I called them about the box after paying for ten years subscription I lost lots of channels and when I called them they didn't do nothing for me .I think 2021 I'm going somewhere else .loyalty I'm not so sure.
Kerry Burns,5,1,"Absolute farse.Ordered sky to be installed early in December, for a start online the advert said “order now and have installed by Christmas” but when we phoned to order the best we could get was an installation date of 5th Jan,Went ahead anyway... 5th Jan came and went and noone appeared - no call or email to inform us. Logged in to sky account and there was a message saying “actions required” to rearrange installation!?Called them were given no explanation as to why there was a delay and were told the next installation date would be February. Told them this was unacceptable and they miraculously confirmed installation for 12th Jan.I’ve just logged in to my account again and the installation date is stated as 9th February!!Have launched a complaint and will be cancelling together and asking for a refund of the upfront cost I’ve already paid. If this is how Sky treat a brand new customer then I dread to think how they treat you once they already have you tied in to a contract."
Jo Sargant,5,1,"I had the wonderful pleasure of enjoying the amazing customer service of Sky today and honestly I’m so pleased I’m not a customer. I rang them up to to reduce my brothers rather large monthly directly debit which was an absolute joke. The Customer Service advisor was adamant that they had customers who were happy with their service but I should have pointed her to trust pilot and the large percentage of customers who are unhappy. Don’t bother calling them, they don’t care!"
Eileen Pa,1,1,"I have been with sky for over 20 years, my neighbour upstairs disconnected my sky cables from my dish and connected hers. The dish was in my garden with no access apart from jumping over my fence, after complaining  to sky I waited a month before I was reconnected. My neighbour insisted that sky had set it up for her, surely sky should have checked whether she had an account or not, or find out to set up her skyQ box and connected it to my dish."
Stephen Todd,3,1,"I have fibre broadband and I live in the SR6 postcode in South Tyneside, Sky broadband is rubbish!"
Ahmed Mahmoud,7,5,"I have been using sky sim only for my second year now. Excellent coverage with good internet speed.Excellent value for money, on my contract renewal I was offered better terms.Highly recommend it!"
Sameer Khalid,1,1,Do I even need to explain it?!? The reviews are appalling. Alright speed but insanely unreliable internet pings are over the roof sometimes. When calling they said I should get the sky broadband guarantee for a EXTRA £5/ a month and it wasn't even my problem! And said that I will have stronger WiFi. Which was a bunch of rubbish.
Akki Deyya Hussain,6,1,"I am not happy with the service i have received from customer service team i have been with sky for 16 years i am diamond customer, i called in December to speak about renewing my contract i was not offered a good deal and customer service advisor said she can’t do anything else this is the best deal she can offer i refussed the offer and said i will leave sky and would like my pac code she gave attitude and said leave sky and go nothing i can do when i said to her don’t talk to me like that i said i want to speak to manager she started with givinv attitude again and said no you can’t speak to a manager wont be able to help you either i wanted to complain and she refused to arrange a call back so i could to a manager i said to her earlier on you said i was a sky diamond customer was being nice and now your talking to me like this she changed her words and started being nice again i requested a pac then ended the call, I had to call sky again on 7th Jan i accidently deleted my text message i was sent for pac code the guy i spoke to said he will have to cancel the pac code i was given and send me a new one out which he could not do and said has to escalate it with another team who will issue me with a new pac within two hours i should receive a text message & email but i could take upto 24 hours i waited called again on 8th Jan after 24 hours the lady i spoke to told her why i was calling she said will look into and the team who provide pac code she has worked in that team and going to escalate it with the team and i will deffo get a new pac code within 4 hours some one will call me i waited 6 hours later i called again the lady i spoke to said she can’t doing anything other colleague has already raised this and can take upto 24 to 48 hours i am being told different every time i am calling the customer service advisors say to me your ours valued diamond customer blah blah but keep flogging me off with wrong information and the excuse they come up with is we are working from and keep flogging me off it has been 72 hours i am still waiting, i am going to cancel my mobile contract, sky tv, broadband sick of this service"
James Harley,1,1,"Broadband at home is useless. I am frequently without internet. It crashes constantly. If I lived in a remote area, I would be more understanding. I live in central London. BT were infinitely better. Please don't use SKY- it is a major mistake."
Drew fraser,1,1,"I used Sky Q for 1 month faulty remote control and no satellite signal, sometimes record failed,  don't buy sky"
Graham’s,4,1,"No real customer service. Can’t email, talk or live chat. They are a total waste of time."
Barry Collins,23,1,"TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!Takes ages to answer the phone considering they are in telecommunications. I tried to sign up for Phone & Broadband on a new property we are buying. 1st I was told I could use my existing number .  I asked four times the salesman said 100% YES. I Then gave them the address of which he said it didn’t exist, after over an hour on the phone he was so insistent on completing a sale he said I have found your post code & address “can I now have your card details” I then found he entered the wrong address but still proceeded.The next day I received an email saying they were unable to proceed as the address was wrong (the salesman’s fault). Then told it was impossible to use my existing number.I wasted half a day for nothing so cancelled the lot & went with another provider."
Iain Cummings,1,1,"I have been trying to arrange an upgrade to my mobile package (2 new phones).  I have a couple of simple questions about the package, neither of which can be answered by the online FAQs.I have spent hours trying to speak to someone but just get redirected to the useless Sky online website.At this stage I am considering taking my business elsewhere."
Maria,8,1,The worst company I have ever dealt with. Took over 1 hour to  sort out an end of contract sim deal to then receive an email with a completely incorrect order.  Nothing but issues with Sky TV and trying to get hold of them to sort it out is practically impossible. Wish there was another provider in my area which I could go to. Sky...sort yourselves out! people pay enough for you to have a better service than the one you are providing.
CB,1,1,They have extorted me because of a pandemic. I have been with them for a year and no issues till the pandemic came. Paid a total of £185 with the help of my 21 year old daughter because she needs the wifi for laptop and clothing line business but now they want to charge and extra £50 this month and £75!!!! next month for a bill that's £30 but there's no way I am giving in this time. Aint no way. Stay away from these crooks. The directors should be ashamedAnne nile
Jo,2,1,"I have been trying to downgrade my sky package that I was offered a few months ago.  I tried twice yesterday for 20 minutes each time and today for 56 minutes.  I simply cannot speak to someone, they will leave you on hold all day and give you no alternative options to contact them.  Do Not accept upgrades from sky, they lock you into a contract and they make it impossible to Downgrade again."
Elina,9,1,"The service is horrific. If I didn't know the company before, I would think they are a scam. I received a broadband in early November and still don't have the WI-FI. The customer service doesn't answer any questions, they are trying to confuse me. SKY is blaming all problems on the other company without assisting me in solving the problem at all. I only receive updates from them when I call them, but they are still useless and uninformative. NEVER use this service."
Marco,3,1,"Over priced, nothing but crap on, Netflix, Amazon prime and Disney + are far better and better value for money"
Stacey,2,1,Don't waste your time with skyWas with them 2 years and was paying £50 odd for the tv and broadband never came down in price so when I left they said I owed £90 out of contract fee which I never took a second contract out for I phoned them multiple times for them to just go and take the money out of my account there a horrible company with no manners when speaking on the phone tried making me out to be a liar. I will definitely not be recommending them to anyone
"Stephanie ODonnell,",3,2,"We have a couple of sky boxes in the house. One required the sports and the rest to resume as normal. Sky confirmed this could be done so we paid for the sky package. 2 months and 2 payments later it still was not working. Several painful phone calls later and we decided to remove sports, Disney plus and movies. They didnt seem too fussed from loosing a lot of our custom. We shall be moving to another provider"
Money Grover,1,1,Hi guys If you want save your hard work money so please don't buy sky ever never..I cancelled my sky TV and broadband and paid all dues already and still they deduct 51euro from account .. I work too hard and save money for myself and family but these disgusting sky company robbed our money because they have all our direct debit details..so my suggestion please don't buy sky ever never and don't recommend
Amber,1,1,"Please save yourself the hassle and time and go elsewhere.The bad reviews speak for themselves.After 2 ‘ghost orders’ which is basically when your order goes through, but doesn’t go live we got to our go live date to find that we weren’t actually going live at all. This was due to a system error on sky’s end. I spent over 7 hours on the phone with them in 7 days trying to rectify this issue that wasn’t my fault. Eventually they told us that we would have to go for the basic broadband so the order would go through and not ‘ghost’ again (?) and then someone would call me after 7 business days to upgrade to super fast. Needless to say I never got that call and throughout the 20 days of our contract we were unable to use the basic broadband at a speed of 1.2mb. Today we went ‘live’ on the super fast and waited for the text message to confirm we had gone live. The broadband then stopped working completely within the hour so when I called sky after sitting on hold for over an hour, they told me there’s an issue with the line in our area externally. This is on day 21 of having broadband that doesn’t work. I’ve looked at my phone records and have spent almost 30 hours on the phone to sky during this time. They’re mostly unhelpful, somewhat unapologetic and utterly unprofessional. Today we cancelled our contract. I work in customer service myself and this is just unbelievably poor service. We are now left without internet trying to go live ASAP with another provider due to them not advising us on the ‘external issue’ until the hour we went live. Please save yourself the time."
Lorraine,1,1,"Multiple engineers to fit sky Q and mini mobile sky Q box. Mini mobile box not working although connected to main Sky Q box. Engineer said it would take between 20 minutes & 4 hours to resolve, just leave tv on with high volume and you will hear when resolved. Message on screen still says same after 24 hours - ‘Please check your subscription entitles you to view this channel on this box. Otherwise if using this box for first time wait a few minutes’. Main Q box works do must be entitled!! Tried to sort on sky.com without success. Trying to telephone is endless without success. Just to add I’m already paying for both. Please help - Lorraine 07944 671968"
Karen Bamford,2,5,"I called to reduce my payments as they were unaffordable, I was paying £66 per month for tv and broadband, really unhelpful assistant told me he could reduce my bill by £9 a month, told him this was still too expensive, he said that was the best price I could get, I asked to be put through to retentions, he advised it would take forever to get through, I told him I was happy to wait and asked again to be put through, he transferred me without a word, I was put through to Keir who was working from home, you could not ask for a more helpful, polite and funny advisor, he went through absolutely eveything with me and chatted while details were being uploaded, he finally got my package down to £39 which I was more than thrilled about, his patience and second to none customer service is the reason I am staying with Sky, oh and the price 😀 so thank you Keir for brightening my day, this 5 star review is for you and I hope Sky value you as much as I do today Very happy customer"
shauna mary,1,1,"Absolute joke of a company, we waited for 3 different days just to get our broadband fitted and so we waited nearly a month in total to get this and then to top it off we spoke to sky this morning to confirm our engineer coming out for tv installation today as we had been awake early this morning to wait and would be waiting all day and didn’t want a repeat of the broadband, they confirmed this and at around 13:30 the engineer turned up only to tell us we couldn’t have it installed as they are no longer allowed in customers houses and we needed work in the house to, sky could have warned us of this new change on the phone but didn’t so now we have to wait until restrictions are lifted just to get tv fitted. Another day wasted because sky failed to communicate!"
Mick Tilson,5,1,"appalling!!!!chat guys clueless then give generic customer service number for 20 minute + wait, they then hand you over to another script monkey after another 30 minute wait.So glad I left for Vodafone"
Rick Phillips,2,1,"I have been a customer for over 20 years with Sky and they have managed to alienate one of their best customers. I have had such an unprofessional and shocking experience. I called them to start a new Broadband contract since the existing one expired. It took a long time to get on the phone and when I did, they offered me after a long time a price for the whole package. The guy got disconnected and tried to call them back the next day. Two new agents tried after an hour on the call to offer me the same bundle, but they kept offering me a much higher price bundle than the one I have. Their agents have been completely amateurish and unknowledgeable, they kept coming up with different prices every 2 minutes and it in the end I terminated the call. I plan to move away from Sky. This company is a complete and utter joke. When they treat their VIP customers like this, don't waist your time with them."
Laura Cumins,4,5,"After a truly abysmal experience with Virgin Media, we switched to Sky TV, phone and broadband three years ago, and have been very satisfied. Our package is well-priced, we experience virtually no broadband downtime, the TV package is excellent with a user-friendly interface (although the voice control struggles with Scottish accents), and we've had no billing issues at all. Contrast that with Virgin, who got every single bill wrong and were still incorrectly claiming we owed them money four months after our contract ended.On the few occasions we've had recourse to contact them, Sky's customer service agents have been great. We received several spam calls one afternoon, and with a single phone call, a Sky agent added a Talk Shield which instantly stopped bogus callers getting through. For a while, we were experiencing connection issues with some of our smart devices, and the Sky operator suggested our existing router may be unable to support all our devices at once. They posted out their latest smart hub a few days later, which solved the problems at a stroke.Our only complaint is the broadband connection speeds in our home are very slow - 10Mbps down and 1Mbps up. However, this is due to our property's ADSL connection, and any ISP apart from a full fibre cable firm would face the same obstacle."
Zoe Evans,1,1,"Ordered sky broadband 12 months ago. I was never connected due to a line issue. The order was in limbo for 12 months and the fault was never put through to the line provider. 4+ hours on the phone to sky customer services. Promises repeatedly broken and nothing done. Forced to cancel, which was a painful process in itself."
Louis Murphy,1,1,"I Have had an original sky box with no problems for years, they then tell me to take the SKYQ box, what a mistake an hour after they leave i get no signal, I now have to wait a month without anything until they can come back!! Poor customer service too"
The brand Man.,7,1,"Sky took 6 weeks to come round to fix a problem and the person said his ladder wasn’t big enough, couldn’t come inside and would use the scaffolding we had up that lead to the satellite. I said I think he can solve it from outside where cable goes in and I will follow his orders for inside. He would t help there. Basically rude slow and unhelpful. He said call customer services. Then customer services is having technical problems. They charge a premium for a terrible service."
Harvey Sullivan,1,1,"I want to be as constructive and helpful as I can, but truthfully I have no respect for Sky. They are a disaster of a provider and I can't in any way endorse their terrible and inconsistent service"
Aya Kunbus,2,1,Sky is the first worst WiFi then Vodafone as I was saying literally glitches too much fix your dumb WiFi sky or just cancel all the contracts
Phillip Morrison,2,1,"Genuinely can’t understand how Sky is still around. Sky player is incredibly glitchy, very poor compared to iPlayer, 4OD, Netflix or any streaming app. Not worth £60-90 per month with limited streaming abilities, channels that are often free elsewhere and it has ads everywhere (so Sky are making money twice). Ditched sky in favour of other services, don’t miss it a bit."
Mr Lee Whittick,2,1,"awful customer service which ended up costing me money which they refused to refund ,left after 16 years and will never go back"
Jay Evans,3,1,Horrendous. The telephone help is awful. They’ve not delivered my equipment and not helping me to progress. Awful
Michael Lastella,6,1,"I have been waiting for Sky Q since October, 2020, had it arranged for today, only for the engineer to ring me saying as from today that he was not allowed to come into my house... i had arranged the morning off from work... i do understand what is happening out there but why not ring the day before and pr-warn me, he said that he could only work on the outside of the house and i would have to install the main box myself plus i had arranged for multi room and he said that he could not do them either, so i said what was the point of you coming... Rang Sky and told them what had happened and they told me that that was the first they had heard of this and was not true... so again no Sky Q been with Sky for 19yrs and treat me like this..."
Martin Huxter,3,1,"Without a doubt the most infuritating and unethical company of all time - Had basically no service for 2-3 years - raised a complaint and booked an Engineer on December 23rd - Just had a call to tell me that there's no complaint logged and the Engineer isn't coming Prateek just calmly told me there's no complaint logged, even though I had logged a complaint, on a recorded call. They are beyind awful. The call was recorded at my end. I've played it back just now, they're claiming it doesn't exist. Log a complaint with the CISAS - don't let them keep ignoring people and telling lies. It gets to the point that you don't want to call them, because the knock on affect the rage they create by ignoring everything you've said, has such a horrendous knock on effect to the rest of your lifeSo it's easier to just keep paying them for a service they don't provide. No more though, just walk away from this terrible group of people."
Frances O'Leary,2,1,Services I pay for went awol early December After waiting ages online was persuaded to upgrade to Sky Q then miraculously my services came back online! cancelled upgrade over phone then kept getting messages about how engineer will come and I will incur charges if cancel Dreadful !!! Will be switching providers
David Hutchings,19,1,To all sky customers please don't fall in hardship through this pandemic during the first lockdown I got cut off couldn't speak to sky because they only priorities key worker as I wasn't a key worker nor a valid customer after 15 years but they cut me off so I had no sky to watch during the only time I would have had any benefit from sky so I cancelled because I had to pay for the time they cut me off i paid obviously but then I wasn't getting all the friendly staff calling just arrogant staff that have been demanding the equipment back or I'm getting charged £180 for all the equipment I don't want it I have gone straight to BT as sky and other providers use BT lines so I'm a BT customer just saying that personally I will never be using sky/ now TV or any other sky owned company
Dana Von Black,1,1,"Worst service ever! Nothing goes live (net,tv) on the time,you have to call them every day and kinda chasing to ask to solve the problem(waiting 30-40 mins on line)till they pick up the phone and they keep saying that they will keep you updated in a week time which is ridiciulous!"
LG,1,1,"Three hours, five calls to renew my Sky subscription. Left on hold four times for over 30 minutes each call, after someone told me that they will be right back with me. One of the contact numbers I was given charges a connection fee and then a per minute rate. This is not good customer service, if it weren't such a hassle to change providers I would have told them to not bother.  You can't renew online, only able to upgrade/downgrade.  Long-time customer with Sky, why don't they make it easier to renew, or enter into a new subscription for existing customers?  Always end up paying more when I renew.  So much for customer loyalty appreciation. If I move home again I will definitely not go with Sky."
Hal Braun,3,1,"no tv signal after ten minutes every time used, terrible service, over multiple attempts and complaints they never sent an engineer for months"
Paula Duffy,1,1,Beware!!!£25 per month then jumped too over £110.00 per month no notification.Then I paid the outstanding balance to unblock my landline but I’m still unable too use my landline and my account is up too date. The customer service is shocking. Wish I hadn’t changed now!!!
Janes,20,1,"Too many adverts fir the money I pay each month, it’s crap"
Kenneth W,1,1,Very poor customer service with no respect for their customers. They hyped up my bills and went from £25 a month to £110.00. I have cancelled my subscription.
anon,2,1,"1 month later, and still no internet. Installation date changed without consultation, and can never get through on the phone. The internet chat is an automated bot, so that's equally useless. Made a complaint, but they've made no effort to resolve the issues we have with them. £5 a day compensation really isn't worth no internet, especially if you work from home.If Sky rely so much on Openreach, why are they unable to communicate with each other?"
Joane Angell,8,1,"Really one star too good,i was with sky 20+ years theres no loyalty what so ever,my satellite went down so I called and got told it would be between £59-£79 for a engineer to come out then hes gonna tell me my dish is broke(which is what I already know)then book another appointment for another £59-£79 then I'll have to pay for another appointment and then pay for them to fix so for my dish being broke gonna cost me hundreds,I did ring to see if being a loyal customer I could get some help as I only have one income coming in,point blank  NO,so I've gone and got a smart t.v and broad band it's a quarter of the price of sky NO SKY, BROADBAND WAY TO GO!!!!!!!"
Mrs B Meakins,14,1,"You fail your customers time and time again ! Waiting for my broadband to be fixed for four days now ,then you have the cheek to cancel my engineer appointment for tomorrow with no reason other than open reach did it RING AGAIN TOMORROW! Thanks to you I have spent four days trying to cope with just the data on my phone and the promise of £5 daily compensation won’t cut it! Looking at alternative providers who treat their customers with respect!"
Ady vrsboy,3,1,If you are thinking of changing to sky... DON'T. I have been with them a month the internet drops out then takes about an hour for devices to reconnect. Common issue they know about. Sky Q is dreadful doesn't connect to the internet and drops. I have everything wired with ethernet now. Sky Q mini is absolutely dreadful and rarely works throughout a full program stops and starts. Engineers been out and admit the new routers are crap. Still loads of issues. Wish I would have stayed with bt never a problem but more expensive but little point on a service that doesn't work. BEWARE....
Dominik Jankowski,2,1,I rated sky with 1 star only because I can not give less. The service is horrible. Solving problems is non-existent. You agree to something on the phone and later on the bill it is completely different. I have been with sky for over 10 years but it looks my journey is coming to an end.
Angela Baker,16,1,Another day without a landline I have spent hours onto BT but they can do nothing.  Posted another message on sky's fault line page with no talk facility.  No daughter has spent hours talking to them they will not talk to her as she does not have our password.  Thought you passed you pad word TO NOBODY.  She is just trying to get them to understand the grave danger we are in.  Six acres is a dangerous place to be without telephone back up and no mobile signal  nearly one hundred pounds a month for nothing.
Andrew Moss,1,1,Engineer booked for 3 weeks to fit new shy Q between 8am 1pm. Supposed to call 1hr before by 2pm start calling sky to see what's happening 2hrs later finally spoke to someone who told me installation is in progress  and engineer should be on his way would get that department to confirm. Guess what nothing. Did have a text saying if I wasn't in or cancelled I would be charged £25. Well big deal I'm self employed and lost £200 today for absolutely nothing. Sky customer service is about as bad as it gets
Madalina Maria,1,1,"Virgin did not have coverage where we moved so we went with Sky. Needless to say, it is absolutely terrible. We've had countless issues and constant disruptions which were not fixed because our contract expired. They convinced us to renew giving us a discount and promising the issues will be resolved. One month later, the situation is the same. The internet disrupts 5 - 10 times a day and the coverage in the bedroom is weak. It has always been slower than we paid for despite having had engineers over 5 times. Seriously, avoid it like the plague, it's a scam."
Ellen Lowther,13,5,We had a problem with the bill sky have sorted it out and compensated us with money off future bills which is more than I expected abig thank you to the whole team at sky
Andrew K,8,1,"Needs to be a minus star rating. Been with sky tv from bskyb days without many issues. 18 months ago changed over to them for Broadband and landline from BT. All fine until a house move. What an absolute disgrace of a company . They make BT look competent. Issuing dates then changing them, texts sent for me to contact them - when I do contact them they have no idea why the text has been sent, engineers missing appointments for the tv setup and weeks after the move still no landline or broadband. Makes things worse being subjected to their adverts saying how wonderful and efficient they are. Hmmmm - I know the truth - the UK has a serious problem with its communication companies such as sky and its other 2 lettered competitor. They can’t communicate."
Matt Higgs,1,1,"Regretting moving from BT. DO NOT DO IT!!! Now tied in to a 3 year contract with terrible wifi, even paid more for a “guaranteed” speed in every room of the house. It’s virtually impossible to make a complaint or get someone to agree that there’s a problem despite several phone calls longer than an hour each. Then I’m told there’s too many devices using up the bandwidth, funny they didn’t mention that would stop everything from working when I paid for the guaranteed service in every room! Literally been going round in circles with them for months. An utter disgrace of a company that takes your money and doesn’t give you what you’ve paid for."
TJ,3,1,"I am extremely disappointed with this company. Their ""moving house"" dept is a fiasco. Not to be repeated by me! Ever!Not only did they mess that up completely by putting the wrong house number (a singular number not even a double digit one). And sending the hub to the wrong house in time for it to be installed on Christmas Eve, they cancelled the install until well into new year! Oh and to rub salt further into the wound, they refused to allow me to take my phone number with me. A number I have had a few decades now.. a number with sentimental value! (Being disabled with memory glitches I cannot now re learn new numbers...soooo a tad more than  inconvenient!). Needless to say, I cannot possibly recommend this company to anyone especially if they are moving house. P.S some constructive criticism- your system does NOT work... what sort of system cancels the entire installation because the hub was sent to a neighbour's house 1 door away! Not logical!!! Goodbye Sky.. you (probably) couldn't pay me to go back as a customer but no doubt you will waste countless pamphlets and slaughter  several hundred  trees to try to enlist me again. Save the trees (be environmentally friendly) and don't bother."
Mark Davies,9,1,After 19 years it's time to move on. The customer service is appalling along with made up bills which will leave you baffled and stressed. Not the same company. I would stress not using them if you want your 2020 or 2021 to be any worse than it is.
customer,2,1,I am disgusted with sky how dare you take a film that has been on sky cinema for years and put it on sky store and think I will pay for it you low life scum don’t you think we pay you enough for all these extra channels and packages . We are in tire 4 lockdown people have lost there jobs and don’t have money to waist . The Greed of it it Disgusts me and it’s Christmas time . What an absolute disgrace you are . You should be ashamed of yourselves my contact is nearly finished I will definitely 100% be leaving. And the absolute drool you have put onto entertain the British public over this Christmas period and lockdown has been an utter shambles your not even worth the 1 star that was mandatory to select before I could write this review . Maybe you should stop paying Jamie Carrigger and Gary Neville so much money to talk utter nonsense and give back to the people the line your pockets it is Despicable and just so you know there was originally a few f**** and s*** in the review unfortunately I wasn’t aloud to use them .
Andrew Miller,3,1,Hi all please think twice before you enter into a contract with sky as they are the biggest liars you will have to deal with  as they are  most disrespectful disgraceful and not a nonce off manners from the customer service they make you wait on hold for 11/2 hours on hold if not longer to be told they don't care and there's nothing they can do as they have been told by management  to fob the customers off which it's no wonder why we get is service as sky was taken over by AT&T a American company I have had my problems with sky since September this year to be fobbed of with lie after lie which it's about time they realised that they don't have customers they don't have a job but what can you expect from sky when they are told by CEO and the rest of his management to not transfer any calls to mangers as this is company policy which is not true as there is no such thing all they tell you is pure lies  bye bye sky as yous are a laughing stock of all other suppliers to TV and broadband and they are a lot cheaper and they treat the customers with respect and will endeavour to do anything in there power to resolve the customers problem not like sky who treat there customers like dirt which if they actually would read the reviews  customers put up might show them where they are going wrong but they don't as they don't give a toss for there customers as long as Jeremy Darroch CEO and the rest of his exelusive team get there big bonuses  and big wage in there wallets they don't care
TA,9,1,"SKY IS A TOTAL RIP OFF!They put me on a TV and broadband package and put the price up, double the direct debit amount. So I cancelled my TV Package and kept the broadband. Then they kept on sending me begging emailed to come back and purchase the deal😆..I think not."
Tom Napier,3,1,"I ordered a Sky Q mini box before Xmas and they made a right royal mess up of the delivery and then a catalogue of errors trying to resolve it - internal forms wrongly sent, charging me for a lost box when it is clear from the Royal Mail tracking that it was returned to them. Four hours in total on the phone to them over the last few days and counting. The most significant failure is that they do not appear to have any form of ticketing system to deal with things like this so every time I call I have to start with a new person who then blames the previous person who I spoke to!"
Ifeoma Ekwubiri,3,1,I’ve been with sky for a while now and I have to say it’s been a load of rubbish especially as it’s Christmas period and where in tier 4 lockdown. Everything they put on was something I had watched earlier this year on sky (old films). They could of done a hell of a lot better.
DPTQ,3,1,"When you just need to speak to someone and the automated phone bot keeps sending you a text message for fixing a bad satellite signal. Sky, your automated strategy for helping customers with unique problems is non existent. I’m going to cancel my new subscription today and sign up with Virgin"
MR A S ALLATT,1,1,"Shocking company,  we decided to swap to virgin media and cancelled the phone, broadband and tv for my 84 year old mother on 10th January, was advised we had to pay extra month due to notice period,  we agreed. THEY CUT OFF HER LAND LAND LINE JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS LEAVING HER ALONE AND UNCONTACTABLE OVER CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR!  This was after telling us she's a VIP customer. Go with these at your peril. Disgraceful"
Charlie Searley,1,1,"Worst broadband going, constant lag, wouldn't mind it if it was once a week or month but its every day. Download speed is appauling"
Jonathan Tapp,1,1,"I have a first generation Sky Q box and paid £50 online for the more recent version with HDR. Despite nothing about this in the emails, the courier wanted the (still working) original Sky Q box back as a swap. This was not what I was expecting in the teeth of a pandemic, a negotiation with a courier on my doorstep. He left without taking the old box, but returned later, unmasked, showing me a message that said he must take the (unopened) new box back. Therefore I have had several minutes of conversation with an unmasked courier all for the return of an old box, which I could have sent back separately if Sky wanted it back so badly. Instead I have now had 28 minutes of mostly muted telephone converdations with an Asian call centre, who seem to have cut me off as I wanted my £50 back. All this for £106 per month just for Sky's own package (no phone, broadband, Netflix or BT Sports etc)."
Nashia Mamun,5,1,Sky is very slow and likes to overprice their Standard Broadband. They told me that they couldn't give me Fibre because of Covid-19. Their service is not good enough to give my family a stable connection and Online Gaming is impossible.
James McCullagh,1,1,Sky broadband and Tv Customer service is utterly horrendous. Extremely disappointed.
Ted01,24,1,My Sky TV went off Boxing Day saying no signal being received. Went on line to report it and could not get a service appointment until 18th January so have no Sky for at least 3 weeks. That to me is disgusting and will certainly influence my decision not to renew when the time comes. Appalling customer service
Disappointed,5,1,Trying to get broadband installed. I’ve waited for a month. It’s all OpenReach’s fault apparently..... !
Archie,4,1,"Appalling customer service called and cancelled my package as no longer afford what i am paying and was given a cut off date, however they still billing me and when you call up you just get past pillar to post and eventually calls dropped..  and the tone of the advisors is like they paying you not reverse.would not recommend"
Emma,2,1,"Horrible. Just what you’d expect from Rupert Murdoch. Very expensive, a lazy disorganised interface, shows listed randomly, no way to pick up where you left off and constant connection fails. And no way to complain or withdraw from subscription. If you want to pay through the nose for absolutely dreadful service, this is for you!!"
Paul,4,1,"Complete disaster - issues for nearly 18 months where broadband speeds less than contracted guaranteed minimum. Also Sky lost one of my complaints and I have written proof of this. Also a follow up complaint open and closed on same call whilst booking an open reach engineer to fix the issue - how does that happen I hear you ask? Great question as I would like to know. Offered £50 compensation but no real apology. Instigated CISAS complaints process as deadlock Sky then noted failures through CISAS route offered £200 compensation. Thought CISAS would be sympathetic to my case - onus on consumer to prove the injustice but very long and drawn out . Despite SKY admission and offer of compensation CISAS adjudicated that I was owed £2.77 - wow the champagne is now flowing. In summary Sky unable to meet the contracted guaranteed min download speed I.e I have paid for a service that cannot be delivered but no real apology from Sky. So in summary min download speed of 2.8 Mbps not met, admitted by Sky, offered compensation, CISAS then noted an injustice and awarded £2.77 plus no apology. Net result a move to BT. Internet speed now routinely in excess of 250 Mbps - why could you not do this Sky? Poor show and your ability to mismanage my complaints was a fine show of smoke and mirrors. My thanks to you SKY and to CISAS. Stay well all."
MOHAMMED  ESAT,3,1,"When it runs it runs, but every week broadband has issues. Specially when you really need to use it. After my contracts up, i wont renew, terrible service provider!"
John W,11,1,The issue that I have experienced was: I had a £13.99 credit in my sky store account so purchased a film at the same price.Sky have added the £13.99 to my bill and not used the credit.I called sky and spoke to a gentleman who put me on hold for 45 mins so i had to give up. I called again and got through to a foreign lady who i could hardly understand and she did not understand my problem and was just trying to sign me up to sky moves.It occurred on: 28/12/2020This meant that Spent over 1 hour on the phoneRefund my money
Martin,2,1,"Sky FTTC connection has been sub standard since upgrading to a point now when it barely works and is incredibly slow. Managed to report it easily enough, however best date for engineer visit is 3 weeks away and that's after an escalation. I can arrange for another provider to bring a new service within that time.Their T&Cs state 'ideally faults will be rectified within 5 working days' and the threshold before falling fowl of ofcom is 30 days, so for the poor users you're on your own in the event of a fault.I'm in that position and am ordering a new service with another provider this afternoon, who actually offer sensible SLAs"
becks rodwell,3,5,"Really great, clear, concise and friendly customer service.  Always a pleasure to speak to these people on the phone.  Thanks for offering me great deals and for going out of your way to get me the best price!  Shoutout to Jawaria for lovely service and a great price!"
Rosy Williams,1,1,"Where do I start.... just avoid them. Price hikes, impossible to speak to a human being, painfully slow broadband, inconsistency, engineers don’t show up, lies lies lies... booked a FOURTH engineer in April for the same problem and he hasn’t showed up yet... can’t cancel the visit or rebook another without speaking to customer services but it’s impossible to reach them... press 1, press 2, press 4, please go online to solve this problem.... go online and get ‘please call us’!!!!! Which is it, call or use online?? I’m Key worker and all through lockdown I struggled With my internet and whenever I tried to call them a recorded message told me they were only helping key workers and then cut the line off... no way for me to tell them I actually A a key worker?! Currently on hold now with them while they rectify the problem I’m having... hilarious considering they haven’t actually asked me what the issue is.... they just said “I understand you’re having problems with your broadband” and then put me on hold... that tells me they can give you better speeds etc but choose not to. I regret being with them for three years so so badly and they won’t let me leave so I’m stuck with them sadly as I can’t afford the charges they want from me to leave them for another company. Shocking shocking shocking. Avoid this company at all costs."
Erin Seamus Ring,2,1,"I recently moved home and it has been one problem after another with Sky. I informed them I was moving out well in advance(called on 11th Nov, to let them know I was moving 15th Dec). It gets to 15th and my Internet isn't working. I call up and they say the move out was never even actioned. And I will need to wait til the 18th.18th rolls around and then there is a problem with the line. They say we are chasing this with BT. I call back as hear nothing from them when they say they will call me. They say still looking into it. I have been calling daily ever since and always speak to someone different who doesn't know anything about it and there are no no notes so I have to explain myself from the start every time I call. It had taken me to call every day for them today to say they are sending an engineer out in the next 1-5 working days. I won't hold my breath. Awful customer service and no one has a clue what's going on."
Amandrose,18,1,"Furious!!!  I have Sky Broadband and Telephone.  Firstly on Christmas Eve, they install 5G into my home without consultation or notification. So I sent a complaint online.  Then someone called me in the middle of the day on Boxing Day, I had family here and we were busy but I went to speak to her anyway but she had to ask me a barage of questions which I couldn't answer from where I was sitting and I couldn't deal with it.  Krithi I believe.  She then sent me an email asking me to reply with a good time to call.  I did on Monday 28th.  Akilesh replied, setting the time at between 9 and 10am.  Fine.  Sadly, I had a bad night and was not awake at 9am, but I did wake at 9.15 to an email from Avinash saying that he had tried to call me and there was no answer, gave me a customer services number.  I replied for them to call back, but also tried the number. Answerphone (as usual) advising me to go online.  Then asking me to hang on and they would get me someone - they lied.  I was sent a text that took me to the online help.  Round in circles.  I am now changing supplier as they are not the cheapest.Update:  Eventually got through to someone else by default, and he was very helpful and explained that I DO NOT have 5G broadband.  Thank you Stewart!  Still very frustrating that you can't get to speak to a proper person the first time around without a lot of headache!"
Oliver,1,1,"Sky is simply the worst company in the UK. Full stop.  Not a single person you ever speak to ever wants to help you - all they are trained to do is sell you something you do no need.  It is an awful company ru by senseless people - there is competition now, Sky, wake up!  I have known companies in emerging markets better than you at serving customers.  Awful and shameful!!!  You will get no more of my money."
Katherine Vino,1,5,"We have swapped from another company back to sky. Customer service was brilliant.....the guy came out (Paul) and he was quick, efficient and very knowledgeable. We got everything we asked for and more and was cheaper than the other company. We love the new shaped controller and the broad band is excellent. So so far so good. We are very surprised to see so many negative comments. We are from the era of 4 channels.....so we are delighted at what's on offer with sky. Christmas trees we use to have to get up off backsides and push a button in to get one of four channels...so we are more than happy. People have obviously been too spoilt. Gosh be happy with what u have got. (Sorry needs saying)"
Harry Nix,3,1,We don't get the advertised broadband speeds promised. The Sky broadband speed test doesn't match any other online broadband speed tests. Always giving us a higher reading than the other tests which seems suspicious. They make it difficult to get help and support to fix this.
Will,6,1,"VIP?! - is not only a complete waste of time with nothing 'real' to offer, it always seems like 'old stock' you're trying to dump somewhere (read all the other, many, slating VIP reviews on Trustpilot). Bet someone in SKY is getting a pat on the back for this awful waste of time. Been a customer for 24 years, and I honestly would feel less insulted if you offered nothing at all."
Reece Coker,3,1,"Absolute sRubbish! It is Christmas, Netflix works, youtube works, Terrestrial channels work... What a surprise, Sky has gone to hell! I have never experienced such a spurious piece of technology! My ZX81 worked more reliably! Shame on you! I reckon another few years and you will be bust! Customers are leaving you at an incredible rate! I have been a customer for over 20 years, and now I am leaving! Bye bye broadband (thats a laugh), bye bye telephone lines, and bye bye TV!"
Homer Simpson,13,1,"I now have Amazon Prime Video ( Prime used for deliveries and music aswell ), Freeview, Disney+, Netflix and UTube premuim for a cheaper price than I was paying sky for there basic TV package and films. Had sky for probably 23 years with ever increasing prices. Last renewal they refused to budge much on the price so I just left. I now get weekly emails begging me to come back, but I can get far far more for less money. It isnt till you leave sky TV you realise how much choice is out there, at a cheaper price and you dont miss Sky atall."
Customer,6,1,If I could rate lower I honestly would. I will Never go with sky I’ve been over charged a million times over what should have switched broadband to another company because they were charging me through the roof they said there was no extra charge being added it’s Christmas Day and I get an email to say they are charging me I paid 57.00 for broadband I no longer have they haven’t amended the bill correctly in the time frame and not to mention the only way you can ever get out of tv with them is if your moving abroad They are truly one company you have to watch more stress then it’s worth tbh never will I return to sky ever. Not to mention they cut my broadband off at 8am I’m the morning and said it wasn’t them but no one else could have so Please really think about it before entering a contract with them if you loose your job or something changes your circumstances they have no understanding and will expect you to stay.
Joseph Ewohime,3,1,My account number is 430037124152. Best thing i ever did was to cancel my account with sky to join another company. After cancelling and paying up front every month for nearly 5 years. Sky is chasing me for €27.66 for my my account that was cancelled and no service was provided. SKY HAS THREATENED TO TAKE ME TO  A DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY FOR €27 .66 FOR A SERVICE THAT WAS NEVER PROVIDED. SKY HAS WRITTEN ABOUT 10 THREATENING LETTERS TO ME.  KEEP AWAY FROM SKY THEY ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN YOUR MONEY.
KINGALPHZ,3,1,Worst wifi in the entire universe. Some a big company with such sh.. service
Mr Linden,40,1,"With my package I am supposed to be able to access discovery plus. Despite calling Sky and Discovery plus, I still do not have access.Sky upgrade is not recognising my stored password since the upgrade happened.Wasted 2 hours this morning ‘Christmas Eve’ still no discovery plus. I have better ways to spend my time that trying to get help from those who are not interested!Will think twice before attempting to upgrade again with Sky as the support is absolutely dreadful and the concern for customer satisfaction apparently zero!"
Daniel,4,1,"I plead with you, that if you are yet to sign up to a Sky package, DO NOT DO IT. I purchased a Sky package over a month ago and I am still waiting for my set up to be completed. This is following two engineer visits, both engineers were completely incompetent and had no clue what they were supposed to be doing. I ended up paying to have a private engineer come out to fit the correct installation.The call centre is full of rude and deceitful liars that will tell you anything in order to get you off the phone and/or they will just attempt to transfer you to one of their, equally as useless, colleagues. Quite frankly, I have no idea how these people got their jobs in the first place. I didn't receive the Sky viewing card which is necessary to activate the Sky package, and was told by one call centre member of staff that the engineer will come with the viewing card. Of course, he didn't have any viewing cards. So another call centre member of staff promised to send a card out by next day delivery and that it will arrive by 10am, which of course it didn't.When asked where the card was, I was told it was not requested and now unlikely to arrive before Christmas - it has ruined Christmas to say the least. To reiterate, avoid Sky like the plague and sign up with Virgin instead"
Alasdair MacMillan,3,1,"What an awful experience dealing with this company is.Didn't turn up for fitting appointment. Phone service just directs you to the website (the wrong area at that) and hangs up on you.If you manage to track down a customer service number, they tell you everything's fine. If you insist, they call the driver, tell you they've left a message and he'd call back, but no issue with the appointment. Then you sit around for another 3 hours while you get no phone call, and nobody turns up.Even now, I have no clue if/when anything will happen in the future.I seem to be able to make a new appointment... for the end of January."
Mr Russell Smith,40,1,"SKY VIPWhat are Sky doing: “Extra Special Gifts from Sky VIP”1) The film Dolittle on Sky one on Boxing Day; I have sky movies and can watch it anytime.2) Football on Sky one on 27th December; I have sky sports.3) Santa Clause the movie for free; wow....not interested and it’s on ITV 24th December.4) Free sky landline calls Christmas / Boxing Day; I already have free calls but don’t use the landline anymore.5) Sky mobile customers have free data Christmas/Boxing Day; I don’t have sky mobile.What a complete load of rubbish, absolutely nothing for me. I’m still waiting to see one advantage of Sky VIP? It’s the worst loyalty programme I’ve ever seen!Spend some money on sorting out your customer service; aim for some decent reviews rather that the constant poor ones you are receiving!"
Vaclav Jasso,1,1,"The worst company I know.  I have waiting for the new brodband update for 4 months.  I lost 4 days off any appointment and 4 times no one came.  They are not able to solve the problem in 4 months, they just apologise.  They will take the full price for the service which they did not even deliver, and they pretend that everything is fine.  And they still have the audacity to call you about feedback on how they helped you."
Myrna Kemp,4,1,"Terrible company for customer service, very difficult to contact. I am helping a 91-year-old SKY TV customer, he relies on it these days. Last night we installed a new BT hub and this morning was trying to link it with Sky Q box but the TV won’t even turn on now. I have tried to ring Sky support but you are only directed to online help which I have already done and not able to solve the problem. Please help your elderly and very very vulnerable customer at this crucial time of the year."
Ian Tindell,1,1,"WORST company EVER to deal with..They just make it as difficult as they can to prevent you speaking with a human being who would be able to sort my issue out in seconds..... We have a problem with our home phone line. After lots of aggravation in trying to get through in the first place to report the issue, we finally get an appointment on Christmas eve. With the changes in government guidelines around covid we have tried to change our appointment repeatedly using the SMS message they have sent to my mobile confirming the appointment, which then takes me to the Sky web site, where it tells me I CAN'T make any changes and gives me a telephone number to call. However when you ring the number given, it just sends you back to the web site where it says over 90% of issues can be dealt with. Despite me changing lots of the options the recorded message gives me it ALWAYS ends up sending me another SMS message and then cuts me off. I have being going around and around in circles for the last day without any success. What a way to treat customers ! Worst Help line ever !"
DSA,13,1,I terminated my TV contact with Sky after 20 years as I had stopped watching sky. I returned their equipment in a timely manner (Sky Q box and 4 sky mini boxes) but Sky charged me £130 as they claim that the boxes were never returned. They are refusing to provide a refund.
EJ,12,1,"Ordered fibre broadband on 14th Nov, open reach engineer cam on 8th Dec said it cant install the fibre and need another team, which came 2 days later, but they need to dig the pavement, I tried to call sky muliple times and emailed them asking for update, every single time, they just tell me they dont have any further news, just need to wait for update... now i wont get any update until 4th Jan 2021, and all these time I am without internet since they terminated it with my old supplier when engineer came out..."
Leslie,4,1,"Trying to get Sky Q installed.  Engineer failed to come (no notification), so had to re-book at the end of the queue.  3 weeks later (today) engineer turns up and is not prepared to walk out of a window onto a (new) flat roof with over 3m all round before any tiles or drops.  So would not change the LNB and said he had spoken to and booked 'special heights team' to come today - finishing 2 jobs then they'll be around.TOTAL FABRICATED & BLATANT LIE.Spoke with Sky and no booking made, and earliest install date is now not until February.Call centres are unable to do anything - hands are tied by systems which have nothing to do with customer care.Even had someone trying to sell me sky mobile while I was complaining about what is happening today.Their engineering teams should be answerable to the customers, and customers should have access to people in management.  Sky does not deserve to be successful treating customers like this.  If they mess up it should be a priority to sort the mess - not to ignore and start again.I have no choice but to cancel before its started.  Back to Virgin who suddenly look really good."
TF,1,1,"I agree with the various other negative reviews. I have been a Sky customer for many years, I have a sky+ box which hasn't worked properly in months. I have been told that I must continue paying for a further 11 months as I am not in a position to let an engineer into my home to instal a Sky Q box due to the pandemic. I intimated that I would just cancel my tv and broadband but was told there would be an early termination fee for the broadband and I would have to keep paying for the TV service I am not receiving.  It is fairly astonishing behaviour from Sky. Also the customer service is dreadful. I would recommend using a different provider."
Jade,1,1,"If you take anything from visiting this site, PLEASE DO NOT SIGN UP TO SKY! I have used many broadband and TV services and yes they have their ups and downs but Sky is the worst of them all. We cancelled after only 2 weeks with them as our broadband hub with go down 20 times a day. Calling up to cancel was the easy part and has just gone downhill since then. Unsurprisingly they disconnected my internet as they said they would but ""apparently"" there was a problem with their systems that made it hard for them to cancel my account. I received multiple texts to tell me they were trying to get me back up and running. I had to get in touch AGAIN and ask what was going on! Eventually after a month and trying to get them to cancel my account, it finally happened. Not after taking 2 lots of payment from me!! Payment for services I have not been using for a month and a half. Please save yourselves the trouble and go with ANY other provider!!"
David Culshaw,12,1,"The only broadband company that I have ever used that failed to send out a router.  I switched from BT in November, not because I had issues with BT it was purely down to cost at the end of my contract.  I switched to Sky Broadband and it went live on the 14th December.  My issue was that Sky Broadband failed to send me a router so I am unable to use the internet!!!  I have phoned them several times only to be told that they have sent one out for next day delivery.  That was a week ago and it has yet to arrive.  Disgraceful customer service and I will not be using Sky Broadband ever again."
Joe,2,1,"Sky is by far without a doubt the worst internet provider I’ve had, I find myself using my 4g more than my actual sky internet, I’m genuinely clueless as to how they can charge for internet this bad👍🏼 And if you play online games on console or pc don’t even think about sky, ever since we’ve had sky internet I haven’t been able to touch an online game without lagging the whole time or disconnecting all together. When I hotspot my Xbox from my phone I genuinely get better connection. They’re basically scamming you."
Nathan,1,1,"I was with sky for 7 years and due to moving property we decided to change our provider. When calling sky and informing them I wanted to cancel, I was transferred to 3 different departments of which none were able to help. When placed on hold for the final time I was waiting for a total of 1 hour and 7 minutes. Completely unacceptable and disgusting to say the least."
Associated TeleVision Limited,3,1,SKY dont care about their Customers as its AT&T now thats AMERICIAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH COMPANY the Worlds Biggest Phone Company you can trust them they are overpriced and hopeless!
Rie Milburn,4,1,"As a brand new customer of sky I was told to set up a direct debit.This never got set up by them so received a number of emails to pay my bill which I did.They then used the card I had just paid with and took a duplicate payment for the same amount.It’s taken me a week of calls, emails and an escalation to a manager to have the money refunded.I was blamed telling me I shouldn’t have made the payment?!!! Sorry sky but as an account manager for a utilities company, when a customer is asked to make a payment you shouldn’t then be using that same card without the customers consent to take another payment.It’s not a good start as a new customer.I used to work for sky in Newcastle for years and know how bad the billing system is. Now it’s outsourced it’s even worse!Come on sky you can do better than this. Your advisors and teams CSAT and nps rely on promises being kept"
Jade,1,1,"I feel like 1 star is being generous.We’ve been with sky for 4 years and have been nothing but appalling.They can happily give new customers what they want and good support but exciting customers, we’re like s*** on a shoe.Broadband is shocking and never works.Would never ever recommend sky to anyone. They really are failing in the years."
Wil Gil,3,2,Sky mobile are not answering help links but sales answer no bother I was told only NHS staff get help( Samsung quickly sorted my problem) this is lying to customers  and taking advantage of the situation. They are not the only company doing this. I am going to be chasing my shops carefully  where I shop after pandemic pases
customer,2,1,"I had recently canceled as Sky was getting quite expensive. My initial 2-year contract expired in April and it automatically switched to a rolling contract. To be fair the watching and viewing experience was not bad, it was just the increase in monthly repayments that was getting too much for us. I canceled via phone and was told a couple of times by the salesperson (after I asked repeatedly for him to confirm) that I would not be charged anything more as they normally charge a month in advance. Long story short, I was charged a further £43.75 the following month (December 2020), and when I queried this with them they said I would be getting a refund in January 2021 however it would only be £17.00. After taking this up with their complaints manager she said there is nothing they can do but refund the £17.00 and have the agent who advised me to get put on remedial training. This is because there is a 31 day notice period. My argument was that I had been informed that there would be no further charges, so we had stopped using the service and had all the hardware sent back, so essentially I will pay for a service that I did not use. When I asked the complaints manager for a reference number for the call so that I could take the complaint further, she hung up on me. Bearing in mind I had to wait a considerable amount of time and speak to 3 different people before getting to her. I do not recommend Sky as they are overpriced for the service that they offer, you could get better deals with the likes of BT for the same package. Or if you're thinking of becoming super thrifty like myself (as a fallout of the current pandemic) you could bin tv and broadband packages altogether and just get a standalone wifi system that you could use to stream off. Our family does not watch tv often so this worked for us, and we only pay £15 a month as opposed to £52, which is what Sky charged. Don't get Sky."
Sammy,2,1,"I moved into my new property first week of March 2020 I rang sky in February and informed them that I will be moving in there in March and ask them to send an engineer out to sort the sky television which they did but what an absolute headache that was trying to get them here. Eventually the TV got sorted and my sky television I have been trying to get someone to my house since March to Try and sort the broadband, I have been on the phone Arguing with Sky for nearly 10 months Trying to get open reach to come out to fit the cable to the house. That took eight months I had numerous days off work when I called open reach and sky told me they were coming out to fit the cable to the house. Over seven times I waited for them to come and had seven days off work No one ever came until I made official complaint. When they finally came out, they fitted the cable to my garden not to the house and left it tied to a piece of rope so whoever came out from sky could pull this from the ground and feed it through the wall Nothing ever came of that. We have been constantly arguing with sky, trying to get them to come out and get the problem resolved I have been on the phone every other day for the last six months trying to resolve the problem. When I call up people don’t know what I’m talking about and I am talking to someone different every time nothing ever gets resolved it is an absolute terrible company. I have even cancelled my direct debit and tried getting with virgin but they’re not in my area at the moment. This is how Sky treat their customers my wife has a tumour and cannot leave the house I can’t work from home because I have no broadband So I have to go into work and put myself and my family at risk of bringing the virus home Because of Sky and Open Reach Both absolutely disgusting companies that do not care about their customers Outrageous Is an understatement.The whole process from start to finish has affected my mental health and my whole family’s well-being The amount of stress and arguing I have been through because of these two companies It’s just added to the problems I’ve had this year losing one of my friends to Covid and my Dad It’s now December I’ve been contacting them since February 2020 And still not have a resolution to the problem I’ve tried other companies but they will only use open reach as well apart from virgin I’m in a no-win situation I’ve had to upgrade my phone and extra £13 a month for the last 10 or 11 months So I had some sort of Internet At my own cost Also I’ve been paying for my Netflix which is £10 a month and my Amazon Prime account which is £30 a month I’m completely out of pocket as I cannot use any of these because I have no Broadband And still I have no cable coming into my house and I still have no Internet I’ve never been treated like this by any company in 37 years of my life. I Cannot believe they put their customers at risk Because I have to go to work and cannot work from home because we have no broadband. Also when open reach came round to fit the cable they dropped a whole bottle of oil on my pathway and road outside the house Completely ruining the tarmac which needs resurfacing, I’ve tried cleaning it several times and the patches are still outside the house a brand-new house with oil all over the road And when I cancelled my direct debit all they wanted to do is sell me another package and promise me someone will come out and resolve the problem still nearly 10 or 11 months on nothing has happened and they think they can charge me for my TV package and broadband even though I don’t even have broadband I cannot believe how the company is run Totally unorganised and needs managing properly and Need to train their staff. Every time I spoke to someone, I spoke to someone different they didn’t know what was going on with the case I’ve made several complaints still got nowhere even reported it to watchdog. I couldn’t even FaceTime my dad when he was dying in his hospital bed because I had no broadband and my Internet on my phone is not good enough where I live to get proper signal for a video call. To say this has Destroyed me inside is a total understatement. This company needs naming and shaming."
anna ksiazczak,5,1,"I have moved home and phoned to sky to let them to know so we can book engineer in, well they booked on 14th of October when he came he found an issue underground which requires underground engineer obviously. Sky sentan engineer but the he just checked the outside socket and left, did not get any update from Sky, when phoned them again they said I need to book an engineer again, well engineer has been book in two weeks when came he told me the underground issue has not been resolved yet and he is not able to do his job. For the next day called to Sky and told them that I need specialist engineer who can do underground work, i been on the phone with rude advisor who was kept saying first i need to book ' normal' engineer. And it looks to me I am in crazy circle, Sky do not fix the issue just kept sending engineer who report issue. Today been visited by 4th engineer who reported 4th time the same issue. Gave up! Horrible service. I'm with the Sky 10 years and never experienced that horrible service like I'm getting nowadays."
LM,1,1,Sky Mobile.Shambolic Liars who sell faulty devices and give misinformation and use any cop out in the book too get out of fixing issues with their devices. Call centers useless. Not necessarily the people working as many have been very nice and helpful...not all however.Brilliant package if the phone works but if you have an issue...good luck.
Bridgette Burnett,19,5,Feeling rather worried that I had to sort out my father's Sky TV Package and what a great support I had.  I spoke to Harkash Samra - what an absolute credit this employee is to Sky.  The service he provided was first class - nothing was too much trouble.  He explained the best package for my elderly parents and implemented with no trouble at all. I would highly recommend this Company and I am with another provider and thinking of changing due to the customer service I received off Harkash and the package that Sky offer.  Harkash is an absolute credit to this company - a huge thank you to him for making what I thought was going to a very stressful situation so straightforward.
Ami Archer-Barker,2,1,"Sky are trying to charge me £40 in set up fee’s for a new contract taken out in the Black Friday event, when the colleague told me at least 10 times on the call that I couldn’t be charged any more than the £39 a month and she would waiver all the set up fee’s. I have just been slammed with a £90 odd bill, two days before Christmas and I’m in SMP. The gentleman on the phone put the phone down in me and spoke over me the whole time I was trying to resolve my issue. The service was diabolical- now I remember why I never went back to sky in the first place This company must be rubbing their hands together during this pandemic and they still continue to take advantage of people. DISGUSTING!!"
Karl Collins,8,1,"Trustpilot you really need the option to give no stars or negatives. Besides that thank you for allowing us to share our experiences with companies.Now the matter at hand is Sky. Years ago as a customer you did matter. If you was unhappy they would do what they could to assist. And if you was leaving then they would try ways to keep you. When Sky got bigger the customer became smaller. A few years ago we had everything with Sky. All channels, multi room, internet. Apart from the programmes being continually repeated and the internet dropping out on occasion we could tolerate it.The price suddenly jumped up around £50 ""more"" a month. We contacted sky and told them that it was far too expensive and to reduce our package that dropped it back to around £77 which we were originally paying. A few months down the line the bill climbed back up to £125. We instantly told sky no more we will stay with internet but take the TV service away. This is where I originally said sky would fight to keep you. The representative said ""no problem I'll transfer you to our cancellation team"" so that is where the TV service ended. 2 weeks later sky contacts us again trying to get us to come back with no deal on the table no thank you!2 years down the line internet suddenly stops. (Week before Christmas) Contacting Sky they tell us it's an outage outside and to ring tomorrow. We do this to be told it might be router and a charge of £75 will be payable as we are no longer in contract. We asked when that ended and was lied to saying 2015. I know this is not right. And the engineer will not be able to attend until Jan 2nd. Of course we can have it for free if we sign up to another contract. I found an email today stating my actual contract ended 26th October 2020 We suspiciously lost our internet December 18th 2020 8 weeks later. And an addition to Sky's fantastic customer service we received a letter this morning telling us because we have been with them for 8 years we are VIPs LOL. So if I at least change one person's mind about joining these deceitful liers with total crap customer service then this huge torrent review has been worth it. Be aware !"
Nattalie Campbell,1,1,"The most appalling customer service and ability to provide service ive ever experienced. We were due to move our internet to our new property and were booked for this to go live on 17th November. 21st December and still no internet. We have been lied to, accused of lying, guaranteed go live dates which have been moved more times than I can count and also promised additional services in compensation which they haven’t delivered on either. I’ve spent over 30hours on the phone to more representatives than I can remember, all at my own expense. They literally do not care about the real life consequences due to their continuous failures to provide what they promise. We have had to chase time and time again to try and find answers, as well as trying to provide solutions like talking to open reach directly. There is zero communication between them and their suppliers (open reach) or between their own departments. I would avoid at all costs."
Ashley Slaughter,3,5,Great service by Gareth (Irish accent) in the customer service team 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Gioany,18,1,"Yeh bad company who holds a large stake, however our own fault signing up to them.  Just go back to Freeview as since covid Sky been rubbish anyway and waste of money.  Got a couple months left and will not be renewing."
Natalie Lee,2,1,"We have left sky after being with them over 10 years. Where start cut tv out few years back because every time we got bill it was always over 100 pound a month even though we cut pretty much everything out. then ok silly us for staying with you for broadband and phone but we did and yes well guessed what Internet down and they say outside fault it was not. But if we want sky engineer to see us we have to pay 75 pounds and guess what we out contract, been pay them monthly now cost to us unless we going another 2 year contact well no not we out out and if you  reading these reviews please avoid we were long term customer you no more thought of ."
Paul Robinson,2,1,"I am reluctant to even give them the 1 star but I cant give them 0. I have phone, TV and broadband with them. None have worked from the start. This has been going on for weeks. I have been with the top complaints team for over 5weeks in that time they have only managed to send one person  who did not fix fault. There has also been two times I have been waiting for someone to turn up but did not arrive. The fact they hae removed the live chat, their phone numbers and email from all their sites tell you a lot. They act like they are the only player in the field like it is 2000. They will not send someone for one of the other faults until the first one I fixed. Not interested in the customer service just looking to save money."
Barry G,3,1,"1 star because 0 not an option Promised the world with broadband but after 15 years full package service they won’t put broadband to my new house ! False promises, lies and a waste of time !!!!"
JohnB,3,1,"Typical Sky. Many (music) channels removed, apparently due to Brexit which doesn't complete for another few weeks, no communication, no reduction in fees for loss of channels. Typical scum attitude of sky."
David,11,5,Problems yesterday with vuner
Conor,41,1,"Every weekend, no broadband...Completely disappointed..."
Andrea,2,1,"If I could give no Stars I would. I have just Cancelled my subscription after 10+ years service as their customer service is Shockingly crap!! Once again there are deals on line cheaper than my subscriptions. This has come about because we were experiencing Internet problems & their answer, spend more money. I spent 2.25 hours on the phone yesterday with we can't offer you a good deal. Stay away from this Company as their loyalty is to Money not Customers. I will tell as many people as I can about their Crap Service......."
Michael Tatlock,1,1,"When i first got my sky package 3 years ago it was £50 a month, now after steady sneaky increases it is now £129 a month, this is for tv (no sports) broadband and phone line which i don't use, so decided to cancel, your penalised for loyalty, what a performance, so easy to upgrade but a nightmare to cancel, and they blame it on the corvid."
Missty,19,2,"Why do they offer us faster and faster broadband only to find it slows down again, until we pay to upgrade for the super fast, fibre optics bla blah blah. Ar but then its the Bluetooth fault. I mean who has got all of their Bluetooth all plugged directly into the router. But do signal booster, amplifiers really work?Why is it that Sky can bombard me with adverts, contact me via letter, email, advertising, text messages, even people selling it on the street. However I cant get to speak to anyone for love nor money. Ask the community, trouble shoot, go to questions and answers, talk to an AI but never imagine you can talk to a human for your £50 plus a month. Blame Corona and stop answering the telephones. Make telephone automated systems twice as long and none of the options pertain to your problem. If you get through to the wrong department they put you back on hold, try to transfer you, tell you to phone back and press option two, gives you another phone number and finally cut you off.Why are they confusingIs Discovery plus free?Why can't I download Sky go on any device older than a year old. Why does the Sky app not appear in the app storeWhy does Sky app say say ""not available in your country"" I'm in the UKWhy does Sky go, once loaded tell me I need to upgrade my system.Is it only people under 25 that can easily navigate their way round confusing gaslighting.What happened to a good service or product for a fair price. No such thing as customer loyality. Not satisfied? We'll try and extract a few more pound before you go.Why are these companies allowed to hold us in unsatisfactory contracts and if you do speak to anyone watch out cause they'll secretly roll you into another 18 months without you knowing.Can the government not limit them to 5 or 7 tariffs so at least it would be less confusing and easier to compare."
David,1,1,"Very pushy selling tactics, selling products that I specifically stated i didn't want (TV with lower broadband speeds when I explicitly stated I wanted fast broadband only). Then sold me a product (fast fibre to house) that sky can't provide me (and I suspect they knew that other providers could and sky couldn't provide me as they kept trying to sell me slower speeds with a TV package). After they cancelled (5 minutes after placing the order), when I called sky back they claimed that I don't have fibre to house when I do. Overall horrendous service due pushy sales tactic and on top of that I have just been charged £5 for a product sky have cancelled. Will never return to sky again. This is not the level of service I've previously had a few years ago with sky. I fail to see why they think it acceptable.BT took 10 minutes to do what sky made last 1 hour 45 due to persistent incessant sales tactics. One redeeming feature was that the cancellation team were pleasant, apologetic and refunded the money."
Lloyd Quinn,5,1,"I cannot believe they can cut you off on a Sunday when their call centre is closed, oh and call centre, what a joke. Every number called, reminds you that you have not paid and the only way is to have your card ready to get sky back on and no one to talk.... Outright bullying. We have recently canceled our contract as we cannot afford, when you explain why, they proceed to try and talk you into staying, more bullying. We only had 15 days left and as explained they know we are on universal credits now. So at least we know when we pay for the service we did not receive, we will not return. HOPEFULLY THIS HAS HELPED OTHER PEOPLE TO NEVER CHOOSE SKY!!!"
Andy Jones,10,1,Believe in better is a joke. Terrible to deal with unless you get really lucky.
Tom Mccollum,3,1,"Absolutely shocking, I have rung 100 times in the last week and can't speak to a human!!!!Broadband is so bad, no one is helping and no way to speak to someone!"
Robert Anderson,10,1,
philip hadlow,6,1,"Recently made the mistake of upgrading my sky broadband, they sent a Router and are desperate for a seven year old piece of equipment to be returned to them or they're going to charge me. They send a stupid text message telling you to phone a number which, when you get through to. It has not got any option for the item that you need, or you can go onto their website. Sky's preferred option because every opportunity they want you to go away and deal with it yourself because they can't be bothered to provide customer service. I persevered and got through to somebody on the telephone absolutely and completely unwilling and unable to help asked to speak to a manager, only to be told ""you can't speak to a manager because I haven't got one at my home!""Continue calling back until I get somebody go through security get some bloke on the phone who can't deal with it. That leaves you hanging are listening to stupid music, then just dumps you back into the phone system so you have to go through security again and get somebody whose answer is, I'll send you a text, no, send me an email with not allowed to send an email. The process is as followsI have to do. Bundle up the productI have to put the paperwork in with it, sky didn't provide anyI have to take it to the post officeI have to go online and print the labelI have to put all the details on itsky have no interest in customer service and you need to avoid this lot. Wherever possible, absolutely no interest in customer service, however, very keen to answer the phone if you want to spend money with themDreadful, dreadful organisation"
Kevin Mcneill,10,1,
Paul,6,1,"I signed up with sky over two weeks ago and the initial installation was fine and everything was dandy for the first 2/3 hours. Our second box (multiroom box) keeps loosing comms with the main box sometimes we can watch it for a few hours sometimes it's just 10 mins.Nothing unusual with a fault, we all get them, so started to try and contact sky to get this sorted.There telephone system usually ends in them saying they have sent me a text with online help and hanging up. I've done all the online help nothing works.I've even waited to talk with someoine for two hours, phone cut off in the end.I've sent 3 emails to sky customer services, none of which has even been acknowledged.To my delight sky called me tonight at 1957, Yipee, I though, unfortunatley it was someone who was trying to sell me more services and as soon as he knew I was unhappy he couldnt get off the phone quick enough and put me into the same telephone loop that i've been in a dozen times.My advice isSTAY CLEAR OF SKY, if things go wrong they are no help at all."
Robert Lynn,2,5,SkyQ box gave up the ghost at 19.00 hours on the 15th December. Box frozen unable to switch on. Attempted all on-line fixes to no avail. Ordered replacement box at 20.00 hours. New SkyQ box arrived at 09.30 hours on the 16th December. Very impressed with the service provided. New box up and running without any issues. One happy customer!
Bob,1,1,Decided to sign up for sky broadband. Sales agent was polite. However I have now found out that they are very misleading with there information. Signed up . Was advised an open reach appointment for the next friday to install my broadband. Text today a vague text saying there has been a delay called sky. They then advised me openreach have to carry out a survey and report before my order goes any further. Now this is not how it was explained by the sales guy. So I feel sky have not been open and honest.Off to a bad start with a company that has so much negative reviews. Therfore the question is should I cancel and go with bt?
Emily May Parish,7,5,Brilliant customer service so far and no wait times to get through. 1000 x better than virgin!!!
Geoff Morley,1,1,"Simply appalling trying to contact them, eventually found a phone number to ring & you get a computer trying to decipher your words & they wanted my mobile number to send me a text with a link to the same useless help guides I'd been reading online for ages - you just go round ad round in circles and can't contact them. Wish they didn't have such a monopoly cos I'd move like a shot!"
Nick Chapman,3,1,
Alastair,4,1,"Sky mobile. They sent me a phone that stopped working after a week, after 3 attempts to arrange for it to be fixed they finally sent out a pre payed envelope to send the off to be repaired. A week later they sent it back refusing to attempt repair because they say the screen was cracked - it wasn't, a slight cosmetic scratch that could never be interpreted as a crack !I contacted the regulator who sided with me. They were ordered to replace my phone and pay me £100 compensation for failing to honour the contract. Will never be a customer of Sky again."
Webster roofing,21,1,Waiting since 19th October for them to cancel something from openreach round ! Unfortunately sky are being bullied and dictated to by open reach come on sky you promote boxing 🥊 there’s numbers you call call for being bullied get from under your desks and tell them can you plz cancel the service you couldn’t supply to me webster Or if you need me to ring them for you I’m always happy to stand up to the nasty people for you
Mrs Clark,6,5,"We have been Sky customers for 20 years and decided to get SKYQ fitted last month.  The Sky Man who attended was absolutely fantastic.  He was so knowledgeable, helpful and professional.  Wish I could remember his name to give him a shout out.  It’s so nice to have someone so good at their job and leaves you feeling valued.  Great to see you invest in such great engineers, Sky."
Dzida Tempa,5,2,"I`ve got it, Sky Q... one BIG bad point... the most uncomfortable remote controller I ever had in my hands... you have to keep it in two hands to operate it."
Miss Kayla Dennison,4,1,"Absolute scam. Renewed my package as unfortunately Sky is the only option other than Virgin who are equally shocking. Got told my package would cost X amount for the next 18 months, all of a sudden it’s almost £15 extra a month and it’s “their mistake” but they won’t do anything about it so I’m now paying more than I should be for their mistake. Furious to say the least! And now I’m stuck in a so called contract (which feels very way one at the moment) with them for the next 18 months that they have the cheek to charge me for if I leave, despite their mistake! Unbelievable. Not the first major issue I’ve had with Sky messing us around for their own mistakes."
HobbyBobby,3,2,"Sky not too fussed about letting customers go right now. After 7 years of loyalty, I’ve been rewarded with a monthly increase of £5 to my broadband bill, with zero explanation and no offer of reducing the price. Left for another provider. I do like Sky as a company, I’ve never had any problems and I think their call centre staff are great. But currently there’s waits of 45min to speak to them. Sad to say goodbye, but not willing to pay that increase."
Steve Pearson,3,1,"Ordered Sky Q TV and Broadband last month for christmas. Built a package with Sports, Movies UHD (Quite expensive) Was meant to be installed 27th November. Engineer said it was ""too dark"" and didnt feel comfrotable fitting a satellite on our roof... Even though we told Sky that we would need a dish putting up 2 weeks before the appointment. Re-booked installation for today 15th december. Waited in all day with a dfay booked off work.. nothing. I call sky and they tell me something has happened and they have to rescheule for 11th Jan 2021. So not only did they not turn up (AGAIN), They didnt even tell me that they were not coming, i had to find out by calling them up after sitting in for 7 hours. So now we have no TV Over xmas when we ordered it over a month ago and have paid quite a lot of money. By far the worst customer service i have ever received. After reading other peoples reviews on here i am surprised they are so popular. Would cancel in a heart beat but then our house would be without interent over xmas so we are stuck now with no TV, Great... Merry xmas sky"
Anon,2,5,"This review is purely for the gentleman I spoke with in the retentions team. I think his name was Kay, he was so delightful and a big change to the other grumpy people I spoke with. I got cut off before I could fill in the phone survey for him but he needs a shout out! Even though he wanted to he couldn't round down that extra pound for my weird obsession but I'll let him off due to him giving me a good deal. You need more of him in all your departments!"
BSS Football,1,1,This is fu*k*ng terrible. £50/month for shi* Internet. And literally no help of advice evrytime we call up for bad Internet speed.
Nicholas Ansell,1,1,"Sky movies packages have gone terrible. Sky premier films are shockingly bad, with a poor selection and film that I've never heard of. Waste of money and come 30th April 2021 I'll be cancelling that and even Netflix which is not with having. Sky really are pushing up prices and giving less quality films to watch every year!"
A Wood,2,1,"Absolutely ridiculous, been stuck in a contract for 10 years, got rid of the abusive ex who was the account holder 7 years ago, all I have managed to do in the past 7 years is change the bills into my name, I cannot change the account holder name, upgrade or cancel without getting in touch with him. They made light of it saying ""just phone him"" like it is so easy."
Everything Amazing,8,1,"Poor service for what i pay them.Poor customer service at all.While working from home now, i have no service at all,using my mobile data.Called on customer service, spoken with James, he says its take up to 5 working days to fix the problem, external problem will be solve by open reach.So how i  am gonna work from home now?Very bad customer service at all."
Jason Smith,1,1,Waiting 8 weeks to get internet on wast of time do not go with sky
Ellie James,1,1,"Do not use this broadband service, we pay for extra strength and speed broadband and we can only get WiFi in 2 rooms of the house. The customer service is awful, when ever it goes down they never keep us updated or tell us we just have to wait all day for it to come back on, which isn’t very useful for school work or online work. Multiple times we have tried to change it and they won’t back down! Awful service, awful customer service!"
Julie Birch,1,1,I wouldn’t advise anyone who has tv in more than one room to have Sky. Most mornings to access the tv in my bedroom to watch the news I have to go downstairs and reconnect the tv box in my room to the main box. On some occasions it doesn’t work and I have to phone for assistance. Unlike Virgin they do not have 24 hour service. The day my contract ends can’t come soon enough and I have only given them one star because I couldn’t give them a lower score.
Rebecca,2,1,I wish I had never signed up. Three mess ups that are completely their fault and I have no tv at all now all over Christmas. They couldn’t care less and with them 20 years. We messed up. You’re inconvenienced. We will not be helpful or flexible at all .
Barry Jackson,2,1,Have been a sky customer for 30 years. Over 70 years of age we have been taking care because of the virus. Since Friday evening we have no satellite signal. We have spoken to sky their response was 45 says to wait.They are obviously not up to the job. At this time we would not recommend
Mr Hunter,23,1,Been with Sky for just two weeks and our broadband is down already. Inconsistent service and poor infrastructure makes working from home during this pandemic almost impossible. Sky should appreciate that people are more reliant than ever on the services they claim to provide. Disappointing service.
John,50,1,Cowboys!!!!Where is my installation you useless cowboys??????6 weeks and nothing!!!!
Robert Bruce,2,1,Nonsense contract terms to try and squeeze money out of people. Also required me to send the equipment back at my expense - i am paying for their DRM systems now... what a joke.
Gerry Singer,4,1,Awful I reported my new I phone 12 as faulty after weeks now they want me to return it.What am I supposed to do without a phone Never ever will I buy a phone through sky
Steven Wilcox,12,1,I would not recommend sky in a lifetime they are the worst company out there I do not like them this sky Q box as they keep telling me is the best ever is a load of rubbish I would not recommend this muppet absolute crap all I keep getting told is follow the link on your text message I do not wish to follow a bloody text message sky sort your crap service out NOW
Miss Walker,3,1,Since joining sky caller id has stopped. They have made it impossible to get through. Just referred to website. I can't even go online as the bill is online to get account number. On a merry-go-round to put a complaint in. Shockingly bad customer service. Never used be like this
Simon Beacham,1,1,"normally a big fan of sky - we have full TV package and regularly purchase box office. We're staying away from our home address and would like to watch the Joshua fight... nothing working on line, chat bot cyclical and no option to speak to someone.  We are desperate to spend additional money with them to see a great sporting event and they're not letting us! Very frustrating"
RJ B,3,5,"Head and shoulders the best customer service in UK broadband.We moved from TalkTalk (the worst business I've ever dealt with) to Sky and they are genuinely so helpful.  We moved on to their Superfast Broadband and Essential TV package, which has worked well.  Unfortunately, I was under the impression that the Essential would include Sky One, Atlantic etc (which it doesn't),  but the customer service team were super helpful in explaining and then removing the TV package and reducing us to down to the broadband only.All in all, very good service and felt it should be recognised."
David Falconer,16,1,"I phoned Sky to organise getting Sky Q Box. I spoke to customer service agent Fahal, who told me that I was a VIP customer as I have had Sky for over 20 years.He gave me all the details, an engineer would call and set it up,  I agreed, he then read out all the terms and conditions. And at the end he said, let me get you a date for installation.And to my amazement, he said the date would be February 14th!!! TWO MONTHS FOR AN ENGINEER TO CALL and I am a VIP customer, that is shocking service.I am now thinking of cancelling Sky"
John Garrood,1,1,"All I have is an email with them. They can't comprehend that I wouldn't have any other possible products, making their automated reply a nightmare to deal with and an extra 5 mins of waiting. So now somethings changed in the background and I can't access my emails. This is idiotic I've had this email for 10 years and there's important information in there I need to access. So after half hour of waiting I was told because I didn't access my account for more than 6 months all the information was deleted, all part of that 43 page long terms and conditions document everyone reads I suppose. Not something important you should tell people up front, I would never want to know that all information on there could be deleted in a heartbeat if I forget about it for a while. So now I can't access my old housing references and I have to say to my  potential new landlord, hey dude just trust me on this I'm a good guy to live with :)."
Andy Marks,1,1,"Terrible service! Upgraded my package and upgraded my router box - returned the old router box as directed - gained receipt at post office (be advised keep the receipt from the Post Office as proof you returned the goods) Two months on and getting emails that I will be charged for not returning goods - advisors tell me I won't be charged - charge now on bill! If you upgrade watch your bills and make sure they don't charge you for items you have returned! I will be leaving Sky at the end of my contract as the service is terrible. They tell me I received the charge as the goods were not returned within 60 days? Upgraded router on 10th October 2020 - returned old router on 13th October 2020 and they received it on 15th October 2020. Last advisor said he would transfer me to someone who can deal with my bill then cut me off - Do they really know what is going on ? So, eventually got through to make a complaint and they said they would credit my bill but could not send a confirmation email or letter to confirm I won't be charged again. I really do wonder how the older generation or people with disabilities deal with this level of incompetence...it must cause so much stress!"
sumarria,13,1,"I upgraded recently from sky plus to sky Q. the contract states 31 days grace period. I am really unhappy with sky Q because it is over complicated. after many hours spent on the sky web-site and countless unanswered phone calls, I finally managed to get through to someone.I simply wanted to get connected back to my old package, sky plus.Why does sky not let one do this? I have no option, but to cancel sky completely.They have lost a customer, who has been loyal to them for the past seventeen years.Terrible service all round."
Neville Hawkins,1,1,Sky has the worst customer service. My internet and phone have been down 3 days now and I'm trying to find a number i can actually speak to someone and any number i find has an automated message telling me to go online and look at their services.It's very easy to buy their products but very difficult to end a contract or get a problem fixed. I will be leaving to find another provider.
Susan Emmerson,5,1,"Been with Sky for over 35 years, decided to leave Talk Talk broadband after being with them many years as the internet was down all the time, had Sky Broadband under 2 months and it is as bad as Talk Talk very frustrated, and like Talk Talk messages coming up to check this that the other when they know it is their end where the problem lies. My neighbours with Sky and they state the same shocking internet. I was told it is easy to contact them it was when I was upgrading but can`t get through to speak to someone, it seems I have jumped out of the frying pan into the fire is there no decent broadband anywhere? not according to the research I have done it simply is not acceptable when you are paying for a service you barely receive, I am feeling very let down so fed up of the connection to the internet being hit and miss"
Andreas,12,1,If this was in America there is no way they would still have customers.... but as the government of England dose not give a ship about us and let’s big company s cheat lie and steal then we must take it like a animal and shut theF-u-ck upThe worst support and customer service I have ever come across in my life The Q box is a waist of time And ass for there broadband Internet lol what a joke
Adam,23,2,"Sky Q is not all that, the menu's are annoying, you can't set a reminder for anything, you have to record it, you end up series linking everything and a planner full of shows you will never watch. I seem to be constantly deleting shows and unlinking them, and even when you do it still records another episode before it stops.Also you have to be careful when taking offers or upgrades as they are forever trying to tie you in another 18 months, I though I was careful, however they got me!"
REVIEW_TIME,12,3,SKY Q is VERY impressive - a must for anyone with a strong interest in TV. 4 and a half stars.BROADBAND; I was supplied with a very poor router. Only 2 ethernet ports. My new Vodafone Router has 4 and a USB port. With Sky the Broadband went off sometimes. One night no Broadband for an hour. Vodafone faster and so far no problems [ apart from all the chaos prior to it working - see Vodafone review].Sky Q now has Discovery + app free for a year. Will Sky sort out their Broadband service?
Eeysa Munir,1,1,NO! JUST NO! Wouldn't recomend sky to anyone! Worst company I could go with. I've been having ongoing issues with sky broadband for the last 6 months. Everyone I'd ring up they would say yeah it's going to get resolved then later in the day stop working again. Eventually after about 6 months of ringing them got them to finally send an engineer out. Engineer come said the router is absolutely fine and there's a problem with the openreach socket and they need to send an openreach engineer out. The openreach engineer came out said that theres no problem on their end either. Rang up sky again turns out they could resolve the issues and yet again was only for a few days with constant faults. Eventually I got sick of it decided I would pay to terminate the contract early and move over to another provider and again Internet stopped working fully! Rang up sky to see what's going on they told me I had a cease on the line for about a weeks time advised  them I would be moving over to another company because of how sick of them with the broadband not working they told me they couldn't do anything as I was moving over to a different provider asked them what am I meant to do for the next week or so for which I've paid for they advised they can't do nothing basically conned me took my money for services I'm not receiving! Even though its only a week I'm without the services! Never again would I go with sky and neither would I recomend them to anyone worst company I've ever been too!
REAL INTEREST,4,4,"Phoned up to renew Broadband, Speak to someone who wants to charge me £10 admin fee for nothing. I say leave it. I decide to phone back give them another chance I speak to a fantastic person who not only renewed my BB, I didnt pay a stupid admin fee and I got a better price on my cinema. So much better"
Melda G,6,1,"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. I've had issues with my mini box since installation SIX MONTHS AGO. I've spent DAYS at this point on the phone, constantly being told they're looking into it, being told I'll get a call from a manager that never happens, and yet they continue to charge me for a service that is not provided. ZERO customer support, ZERO transparency and ZERO regard for anyone. A company worth £31BILLION+ that needs to steal from its customers... despicable. When you take money for a service you don't provide- that's what that is- STEALING. They are thieves, no two ways about it. I'm still waiting for my refund and for the box to finally work."
justin bloomfield,21,2,"I have been with Sky for nearly 20 years, although only 5 years in their eyes because I left for 6 months, so I conveniently fit into one of their lower reward schemes. That is not an issue because their loyalty scheme offers nothing that actually benefits you that I can see.Basically, there’s not much between Sky or Virgin, apart wiring throughout your house, but Sky is expensive and deal you get seems to totally depend upon who you talk to, and even then, it’s probably too much for what you actually get. Old and average movies repeated over and over again for weeks and a heap of channels you will never watch - because they’re rubbish. Sky is essentially Sky sports for many people and it costs a lot. They’ve even lost Disney and the package for kids is almost worthless. Aside from their cleverly marketed loyalty scheme, which really isn’t real, you are likely to save a lot of money using the alternative or a combination of Netflix and other online services.Can’t recommend Sky because you just don’t get enough in return for what you pay and sticking with them because you think you’ll be rewarded in some way is what they want you to think. Take a good look around before committing to them."
SUKHDEV MINHAS,15,5,"I called sky today because my package offer had expired.The price I was quoted for a new package was too expensive so I asked to leave.I was put through to Liam, he managed to get a deal for me that I was extremely happy with.Liam customer service was excellent and he made me feel liked a valued customer.Thank you Liam, you made my day."
Mya Cowdery,1,1,There only one word to describe my experience with sky and that is Terrible.
Gary Scott,1,1,If there was a minus I’d give minus 10 load merchant bankers kept charging me cancelling charges when I even cancelled been on the phone around 5 hours maybe more can’t wait till my contact ends wouldn’t touch them if they were last internet provider in the world
MLD 4032,7,3,"Returned to Sky in mid Nov after several years away. Main reason for returning was the TV and specifically sky sports. Managed to get a very reasonable package deal which included Sky TV, HD, Netflix and Broadband. The Sky Q box is fantastic. I was unaware that the 'free' Netflix was only SD. It was like watching it on a spoon so I reluctantly upgraded for an extra £5 a month to the UHD package which also upgrades Netflix to premium. The UHD/4K picture is unbelievable, especially in sports. I'm blown away. Cannot recommend highly enough upgrading if you can spare the extra £5. Money well spent in my opinion and makes HD look poor now. However the internet. Urrgggh. The wifi performance is awful. Fluctuates. Can range from circa 30mbps to 0.7mpbs download and an upload speed of sloth/snail. Disconnects. Fails in rooms next door to the router. Sky wanted more money to add on boost packages. I've cancelled the internet and gone back to talk talk but opted for their 150 fibre package that was cheaper than sky's standard broadband. TV is unbeatable. Internet (I believe the wifi hub) is rubbish."
kimi,3,5,"20yr customer only seen sky improve, I've since added mobile and internet; all excellent. ✖️However, their sky VIP scheme returns no benefit, I've never received rewards. Easily seen as a marketing campaign only?"
Proudly honest,39,1,"Impossible to reduce marketing preferences. I have tried on the app, safari, Ecosia and everytime I go back in they are changed back to what they were.Well here’s one star for not doing what you’re supposed to"
Linda Saunders,35,1,"I've just run a speed test 1Mbps! It's been like this on and off since March. Can't watch anything on Netflix/YouTube without it buffering.Thankfully, I've had an email to say my contract is up soon. Unfortunately, I have to call them to cancel. Wish me luck getting to speak to a real person to cancel without waiting for a few hours."
Jode W,10,4,"I always recommend sky, but I when I moved home I upgraded from SkyHD  to SkyQ being told my bill price would stay the same there would be no hidden cost of extra charges. But my bill is more expensive because I now have to pay for HD which was never explained to me. So I was LIED to in theory as my bill price was never going to stay the same. Sad but it’s the only issue I’ve had with sky so I do forgive them"
Wendy Bickerstaffe,3,1,Do not bother using sky broadband been waiting a month for them to connect ours. Customer service is awful. Engineers have come twice and twice promised to come back the next day. They didn’t come. We work from home and it is impossible to do our jobs without broadband. We have rang countless times and been given countless promises. Go somewhere else.
Byron,4,1,"My broadband was SUPPOSED to be activated yesterday 8th December. I received no correspondence from you even still now, I had to call to find out that, I have no appointment and Il find out if i have one on the 16th of December. But your app said activation in progress all day on the 8th.I am a senior Frontend Developer. I need internet. This is extremely poor service. If i start a new order I can select a date for installation but your staff are restricted and unable to give me a date for a WEEK. THEN WHEN WILL THAT INSTALLATION DATE BE FOR?How the hell can your response be we will let u know in a week, it is 2020 i can speak to someone on the other side of the world in seconds but ur staff are unable to book me in a new installation date.Sorry extremely poor service expected more from you to he honest. I am considering cancelling my order.I really wish I looked up this poor rating, that you have beforw ordering."
Lesley Maynard,5,1,Had to call sky when my broadband went down again (second time in less than two weeks) . Got coerced into upgrading to sky q. Worst coercion of my life!!! If you can imagine a prototype of sky+ about 20 years ago then you may get some idea! The remote has less features and you can hardly make out the different functions on it in the evening and you have to have to lights on full to see any markings. The layout  on the tv screen is awkward and clumsy. You can hardly read the TV guide it’s so pale and wishy washy. The TV guide in my mobile for sky + was great. TV guide for sky q which sits on another app(sky go) is pathetic!!!!! I could go on and on but believe me a five year could have designed better.
Hannah,1,1,"Signed up for new broadband and got given an installation date 2 weeks from sign up. Engineer didn’t show up and there was no explanation, had to wait 2 days for sky to book me a new appointment which is another 3 weeks away! The process was awful, it’s impossible to get a person on the phone and I was hung up on by the automated service 3 times. Responsibility also rested with me to reschedule the appointment even though it was not missed because of me. Awful."
Steven Hadden,14,1,"Try not to lose my temper too often as it is not good for you but I would challenge any mild mannered person to go and try to talk to a human being at Sky, unbelievable! I have been having broadband issues for months on end and keep getting completely fobbed off, I have been told all sorts and have generally found their technical team to be quite unhelpful as in the problem always seems to be at my end, too many devices connected to the router etc etc. I also asked a few months back to leave the contract as I was not getting what I paid for but unfortunately this was going to cost me over £300. Spoke to a nice lady today who has arranged an engineers visit, unfortunately this has came after hours on end getting told to visit the website through an SMS and basically getting hung up on no matter what I said to the automated phone system.Just for the record I was sold a package of ""superfast fibre"" with a estimated speed of 16MB (i know !) and a guaranteed speed of 12MB, my tests generally come back at 5MB - 8MB, and the best upload speed I have ever had was a mighty 0.5MB (this was just fantastic for Google Classrooms)Is this the way you treat a ""VIP"" customer of over 20 years, thank you Sky for making me feel so special."
Mr Keith Vincent,4,1,"If i could give zero stars I would. The Customer Service I have received recently and also sometimes in the past is deplorable. Advisors do not listen, are inadequately trained and few have any idea about Customer Service and Satisfaction."
Bilal Hussain,2,1,Dont even want to give them a star. total disgusting people. never picked up phone. always on hold for more than 30 minutes. can not cancel on tv and have to call them. on the other hand they have added services which i never ordered in first place. total disgusting
Mr P. K.,9,1,"Just agree with a lot of the bad comments below. 35 years a Sky customer which make us a ""VIP"" customer. Just moved and now have two wait until 4th Feb 2021 for broadband. 2 months. Sky agent actually told me to try and find another provider to get it quicker. Awfull comment from a representative of the company. Bad customer service."
mark kember,20,1,"Broadband often sub 1Mbps, way below what's promised and paid for.Only thing worse than the connection is the customer service, so trying to rectify is hitting head on a brick wall territory.Just have to ride out contract until we can escape to a more competent provider which can't come soon enough."
Riquelle Pals,3,1,"What a joke,Applied for installation weeks ago and yesterday the engineer didn’t even show up??The first next available slot is the 29th and i won’t even be at home then.So when will I finally have WiFi at home??Terribly rude costumer service who’s not helpful at all. In my opinion when a engineer doesn’t show up he should come back in his own time after work but no they won’t they will let you wait at home for another 2 weeks without WiFi. I wish I could give 0 stars instead of 1"
Kevin Springer,1,1,After having sky for 9 years I upgraded to sky q in September I was told an engineer would turn up mid October he came to the house as promised took one look and said the job needs a couple more lads they then booked me in on the 7th December I took the day off inly for no engineers to turn with no call or email as to why I then called to find what was going on only for the customer service man (kevin) telling me he has no info other than its a triple man job the same as the ones who did not turn up I then asked to speak to a manager  and I was told they have no information either so the manager's are being paid to do a job that they cannot do as they have no information and I cannot contact the engineer department. Sky are the worst company ever avoid at all cost even if you need to go virgin or another source trust me do it.
Jake Costagliola,2,1,Terrible service. Booked installation of sky broadband for yesterday 07/12 over two weeks ago. I took the day of work for the engineer. I received a text at half 8 at night advising that he was to busy to make it. today I called sky after 1 hour on hold and they said the next slot would be the 18/12. Ridiculous wait time considering it was not my fault. I am now not able to work from home for another two weeks.
James,2,1,Absolute joke of a company from top to bottom. To call anything they have a “service” should be illegal when they can’t provide it. Had wifi issues for months now and we’re finally able to be out of contract and move on from this hell hole.
Ms S.Y.A,2,1,ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. MY SKY INTERNET GOES OFF EVERY FEW DAYS. I CALL THEM UP AND GOT TO HOLD FOR 1 HOUR TO GET THROUGH TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE. THEN I HAVE TO RUN EACH ROOMS Q BOX TO UPDATE IT AGAIN ITS IS EXTREMELY TIRING AND 3 HOURS ARE WASTED. SOME PEOPLE WORK FROM HOME SO ITS A BLOODY NIGHTMARE WITHOUT INTERNET.IT IS SO FRUSTRATING DRIVES ME INSANE EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS SAME ISSUE.EITHER FIX IT PROPERLY ONCE AND FOR ALL OR COMPENSATE US!!THEY ARE VERY QUICK AT TAKING PAYMENTS BUT DELAYED IN FIXING THE PROBLEMS.
Harold Dawson,16,1,"Got a sky Q fitted this morning,10 minutes after the engineer went out my door sky went off ,said no internet signal ,phoned sky 6 times 3 times they cut me off once they put me through to cancellations then they said they will send out an engineer in 7 days,I told them that was a disgraceful way to treat customers,then got told its the cable thats wrong ,they have not a bloody clue what to do"
Mohammed Bulli Seghier,14,1,I'm about leave sky I haven't had no internet for 2 day and thing is I phone them already told him about it he said it's ok i said to him box boiling hot where y letters is from name sky and he said it be like that and work for a bit then went off again now it dont come on at allForget phone them I aint waiting for another 50 mins for them to answer if my internet dont come bye my next payment I'm gona cancelled it
Cristi Sandor,1,1,"Very hard to get in touch with them, and most of the refunds they have to do, they only if the customer contact them, cuz if not that's good money for company!"
Andy Brice,4,1,"Don't waste your money on this rubbish service. Sky changed my TV package recently and turned off my on demand services at the same time. I'm paying for Box Sets, Catch Up TV and On Demand but none of it works. They REFUSE point blank to do anything about this and I'm now stuck in an 18 month contract.What you do get:Amstrad hardware made in China that is rubbishSoftware that freezes and needs constant rebootsNon existent customer supportBills that are increased whenever they feel like itSpecial offers only available to new customers.SKY TV is a COMPLETE JOKE and AN ABSOLUTE CON!!!"
Mr Gwynfor Adams,23,5,Just to say thank you to all the team at Sky TV who have provided us with excellent service throughout. I have hearing issues and they have been extremely helpful and patience to me.
LMAG,26,1,"Absolute joke why are you still billing me for my old house, and getting through on the phone is a joke, why do sky love to leave me hanging on hold, absolutely a disgusting company can’t sort anything out and staff all say different things that’s if you can get to talk to them😡😡don’t come at me sky for a direct debit not payed because I DONT LIVE THERE ANYMORE"
Steve C,4,1,Superfast broadband is a scam. Cust. service is non existent. Avoid. Recommend Virgin Media instead.
David Paige,1,1,no way of contacting them no email no phone number
T William,6,1,3 times the internet has cut in and out. What’s the point of being an internet service provider that can provide a decent connect JOKE
Funky Ferret,1,1,"Sky q and the mini boxes are the WORST inventions ever to come out of that organisation.  What they don't tell you is that the performance of the mini boxes totally depends on the furniture in the respective room, - the fact that human beings and metal intercept the signal causing the mini boxes to loose connection - so you end up spending hours rearranging your furniture or having to sit in a specific position, or not being able to open up cupboards, or battling with cables to try and extend the mini box to a location where it won't have it's signal interrupted.   You can't watch a program in your own bedroom and have your laptop open without the signal dropping because it doesn't like the metal housing of your laptop.   It is absolutely ridiculous - there is no reason why the mini boxes should be set in such a way where they connect only via the box and not the actual satellite dish.  Not to mention the increased amount of radiation that is now passing within homes because of the main box serving as the server and the mini boxes relying solely on that for connection.  Do not waste your money ""upgrading"" to Sky Q.  Stick to what you may already have - and save yourself the serious hassle and health hazard caused by this USELESS thing."
Alan David Blackett,43,5,"Been with Sky for years, had little problems, but sorted out straight away. Can't see me going anywhere else"
Jake TheCake,1,1,
David John Cowling,2,1,Had to leave 1 star could not leave none sky gone to the dogs took all controls off never miss carnt do any thing anymore plus keep jacking price's up its not worth the money tied up in contract for 18 months to try get a discount shameful then all you do is put repeats on ive been with sky over 20 years now its crapp not worth the money ripping off your customers over priced pay for everything plus sky Q 💩 yoi need to sort instead of being a money grabber
Devi Pun,6,1,Sky wifi connection was good before hence renewed with same one with better speed and reasonable price but no its getting worse now..i am fed up off this slow wifi..run soeed test u will see more than enough speed bar but in actual its crap ..
John Saunders,14,5,Engineer.should of called a hour before arriving  but didnt was not happy he just shoved a card through the door saying he couldn't  get in touch.hello a phone call  a bell on the door a knocker on the door maybe because it was cold and wet and he didnt want to do the job. Anyway no stars for him .but 5 stars for swati the lady who sorted it all for us a big thankyou swati sky need more like you and less engineers like the one who didn't  want to do the job ....
HZZ,12,4,"I was experiencing problems with my broadband which was caused by an external issue. Sky booked engineers and got it done. Unfortunately it wasn’t rectified the first time around and one particular agent misinformed me, but eventually they got my broadband up and running and reimbursed my no service period. Thanks Sky!"
Sam Daniel,9,5,"I only have sky broadband. I've never used any other of their products.  I have recently upgraded to sky ultrafast broadband and was told to expect speeds of 142mbps but i actually get about 159 (35 up)Sky have been amazing to deal with, friendly staff and the whole upgrade process was simple.  The new router they provide is exceptional and looks pretty nice too. I'm happy to stay with sky.  I'm not sure why their reviews are so low, but they've been a god send to me during Corona."
Paulo Pinto,1,5,"Mom’s been a Sky Customer for over 5 years, recently her internet had slowed down as we had the old Hub/router.I’ve just got off the phone to Sky customer service and the lady on the line ‘Pooja Nandivkar’ was so helpful and made sure I got the best service I could get. It’s people like that that make the world a better place. Very considerate and understanding!! 5star customer service, It made my day Thank you for your service! Paulo Pinto da Silva"
Steve,2,1,Worst company I have ever dealt with.Liars. Thieves. Bunch of cowboys. Avoid like the plague.
Joanne Hinds,2,1,"I am paying for Sky Movies every month and the films are shocking nothing but repeats I've noticed any films you want to watch have now all gone to sky store which I would have to pay extra for and the Disney films are all moving to Disney+. The new movies each day on Sky premiere I've never even heard of half of them if not most of them, some don't even have a rating because they are that bad. Think Sky need to take a look at this."
AM,4,1,"One day before moving into our new house it turns out the doofuses at Sky have made a mistake with our broadband order. So we’ll be without broadband for two weeks whilst trying to work from home. Hopeless. Will go with Virgin who are offering a nice £79pm deal for broadband, calls and TV including Sky Sports and BT Sports."
Jane,5,5,"I have just switched to Sky for my Broadband and tv having tried nearly every other provider out there! I always dread switching because something always goes wrong and I have had some appalling customer service elsewhere. Sky were absolutely fantastic, everything went like a dream and they kept me informed all the way along, the gold standard of Customer Service."
Aj B.,4,1,"But a pigeon rather than use SKY mobile and but a book of stamps rather than use their email, its mucg quicker, terrible just terrible coverage, service & support, the connection & internet speed is a joke. Sky Tv good but expensive, cheaper services available, hope this review works, Im using SKY broadband so chances are it will have dropped before I fini"
TB,2,1,"It's very ironic that a communication company is so hard to contact. There's no chat service and you have to look very hard to find the number you need. The broadband is good but contacting them turns out expensive and time consuming. My bill was unexpectedly high by £10 and to fix this I spent £10 talking on the phone to two agents who couldn't explain in simple terms what happened. So there was lots of back and forth for something that was wrong on their end but took 30 mins to admit.And to not have a chat service in 2020 is the fail of the year. Yes, that's the year with Covid and all!"
john coote,11,5,"MST54 - she is a legend - Sky Mobile Queen and lifesaver! Having “thought” I had sorted my forthcoming one year contract, it clearly had been done incorrectly (with no internet) - prompting a call to Sky Mobile. A short wait, and a friendly voice - all explained, all sorted, all apologised for, all superb, this lady should get a Christmas bonus - I will continue to tell everybody just how good Sky are - ignore the haters and halfwits who don’t know what they sign up for or want something for nothing, just have a nice friendly chat and I’m sure you’ll be looked after - I certainly feel that way - thanks again Michelle."
Louise,5,1,"Ordered mobile device only to be told the next day I would be waiting 2/3 weeks, Been back online today to check progress and are advertising the device as in stock now and order in the next 7 hours for next day delivery for free. Contacted sky and the agent was clueless and said he doesn’t know why.... asked to speak to someone who does and just said can Only tell me what it says on the system!"
Amber,1,1,"Sky's termination processes and conditions make it very easy for you to unwittingly continue paying for service that you no longer want, particularly if you are paying for the service on behalf of someone else. And in case of mistake they tell you too bad. In our case, we paid for Sky tv for an elderly parent living alone, and when she was moving house they would not let her terminate the service as she was not the account holder, and our letter of termination got lost in the post. It was two years before we realised that we had incurred bills for over £2k for a service that no one was using. Would Sky refund any of this money? Not a chance, even though it cost them nothing to provide the service during that period, so they have basically made a windfall. Complained to the adjudicator that it is unfair on a consumer to not make an exception on the refund policy in such circumstances but it was a total waste of time."
Dan Jones,6,1,"You took £60 over my usual bill amount out of my account today.The bill had no description for this charge. I checked my account to make sure none of my family had downloaded Sky Store products. They hadn't.I had no call/email/text from you as to why. Your chat service has been ""busy"" all day as has your non-existent call centre.Luckily for me, I have established connections with Banks and Solicitors. Including my bank and my solicitor.I showed them your bill, and my bank has not only refunded the £60 you f*cked me on, but also the entire amount of my bill for November.Now because of your stupid mistake at the worst time of year, you have lost a loyal customer for life, unless you have the care of duty to unscrew it and convince me to stay."
Nicole Horley,1,1,"Wouldn’t recommend it, Aload of crap . Complete rip off, they just want money . Got debt collectors on my case because I left them and that was 2 years ago😂 they lied to the debt collectors saying I only ever made 2 payments when it was on direct debit lol so how could I not pay when it comes out automatically. I left because there services were rubbish didn’t work properly wasn’t getting my money’s worth, 2 years later though . You gotta laugh . They even double charged me for the last payment . But they’ve got away with that haven’t they . Now I have to pay 2 years worth of debt because they couldn’t handle being left . I did nothing wrong would hold my hands up If I did . If your smart, don’t do it . Might look worth it with there flashy offers but they will soon up the amount when you’ve already signed a contract and then your stuck . Talk talk are better and that’s saying something also.. get now tv, has sky cinema for just £12 . Don’t have to pay there silly prices"
Chris Johnson,3,1,Discovery Plus has to be be Sky's worst introduction - nightmare to download
Matthew Borowiczka,4,1,"Probably the worse company I have dealt with in a long time, they have completely messed up my home move and left me without internet for a week when both my partner and I are working from home. Supposed to have had a call back yesterday from a manager it never happened, had to call back today 3 times, once I got cut off after 25 minutes of waiting, the second they said I had to wrong department so put me through after a 20 minute wait a further 40 minutes to which I was told there is nothing they could do and I had to wait for the call from the manager i should have had yesterday. JOKE I have been with sky for 10 years and appreciate its difficult at this time but you can still deliver a level of customer service to your paying customers. I will be cancelling today if and when I get the managers call. 3 days unpaid work,£25 offer of compensation for a dongle that cost £45????****further update never got the call back promised again, it’s now Wednesday and still not spoken to anyone, sky obviously are doing that well unlike most retailers they don’t need customers money****"
Jackie Johnson,1,1,"This company is the nearest to extortion iv ever came across,recording calls that only they can listen too , locking you into contracts by default ‘reading terms & conditions , staff using profanity, expensive, snail pace broadband, kept on hold for hrs not returning calls , I wouldn’t recommend anyone to do business with this joke of a company, I will be going further with my complaints, Yukie arrrrrgh"
Consumer,3,1,trying to contact sky to return a voice control remote that doesnt work... or does work but never accepts the voice command rendering it neither use nor ornamentI have spent many hours on line and on the phone trying to get to speak to someone. been disconnected 5 times blah blah blah worst experience!! Get your act together SKY and look after your customer
Steph B,4,1,"Awful experience. I moved house in the middle of March this year with Sky 'home move' Firstly the Engineer wouldn't even drill through the wall from the outside for us to connect the sky satellite to our box - we had to do that ourselves. Secondly - Sky then cancelled our broadband because the gents could not come in the house to connect it - fair enough due to the pandemic - but they had made a temporary connection - which worked fine - until they could come back in the house. I explained this to sky, but they cancelled it anyway. Which meant throughout the Lockdown, I could not work from home and my children sruggled with school work as we had to run everything from a mobile hotspot. I had enough and cancelled mySky contract - we couldnt access all the tv we were paying for without internet and had no broadband.In June I took out a new contract with sky - because Virgin would not supply our property. I had sent back all the equipment from our previous contract - except the Sky Q box because they did not send a new box with our new contract. Everything has been fine. Broadband good and TV. Except now - Sky has charged me £140 for the Sky Q Box - that we are using for the reason I said before! £140 3 weeks before Christmas!"
Anthony,4,1,"Getting worse and worse. My broadband has been unreliable recently and not particularly cheap compared to competitors. Customer service is impossible to get through to. Whatever you do, save yourself some stress and don't try the online chat which just doesn't work any more. Utterly unreliable all round - just moved to Hyperoptic who are already head and shoulders above in terms of service, reliability and price"
John Wall,4,1,"Been a customer for 15 yrs. asked for a sky q upgrade told unable to do it a engineer not prepared to go up a ladder to change dish on my chimney. Told no team prepared to do it either, even they fitted it 3yrs ago! Unbelievable, cancelling going to free sat, no more hassles"
Customer Annmarie  Kerr,14,1,What to do when you know how to fix a problem but no one can help. Both sky and openreach blame each other. The phone line from the pole to the house has a break in it so when its wet and windy the connection drops but try as I can to get anyone to replace it.The only way to solve the problem is to cancel both lane line and sky service  £115.00 a month.
Aaron O,1,1,The worst wifi ever. Don't do it to yourself. I barely had enough wifi to write this review.
Julieann Parker,1,1,This is unbelievable ridiculous. We pay these high prices and my WiFi can't even stand the weather. It is crashing every second and I don't think I have ever had a smooth excellent connection. I would rather use a cheap Chinese rip off then this.
Douglas McBride,1,1,"Initially my sky band account was in my ex partners name. I changed this over 5 years ago. Since then I have varied the packages  increased them, decreased them and finally added broadband. I have moved to Germany and tried to cancel the sky TV package, keeping the broadband for my daughter. They claim I can't cancel anything as the accounts are not on my name. Lady was rude and dismissive. Would not recommend Sky to anyone."
Heartbroken,9,1,"Problem with wi-fi rang sky got hung up on 8 times finally got through to someone kept on the phone for 1/2 an hour she had to keep putting me on hold to ask someone!! Asked for an engineer to come sort problem was told can't because of covid 19!!! Really !!!!! Get this they can send an engineer for new installation, but can't send one if you have a problem with their service absolutely appalling service!!!! 😠😠 One star is too much useless bunch of  .......!!!!"
Jim Bob,2,1,Awful.  Sky doubles their prices at the end of the contract then put you on hold for hours when you try to cancel.  Just awful
Lauren Tidball,1,1,"Terrible experience with sky, my phone broke within warranty well over a month ago yet still no phone back,   Being passed from one customer service team to another. Absolute joke. Would never use them again."
Debbie daly,10,1,"Still no connection only intermittent called again asked to speak to a manager the question was avoided,   Saying they are trying for a appointment but their system was playing up promised a call back .  Still waiting .  Also asked how to raise a complaint said he would do this when he called me back ?   Such a shame as the engineers are very nice"
Sara Milner,1,1,"I cannot believe our experience with sky. We ordered broadband with them on the 21st and had a callback on the 24th confirming everything was ready for installation today. We called them this morning as we had not yet received the hub by mail. They then told us that our services were not ordered due to a “line issue” (??) where the previous account on our line was still being cancelled that was noted on our account on the 23rd- the day before we had a call from sky confirming the order and installation date was all set. The rep confirmed this was oversight by sky as the rep had visibility to this note but did not bother to check. The rep proceeded to tell us that the services would now need to be re-ordered and would take 10-12 days for installation. On top of that, it would take 24-48 hours to remove our previous order from our account. Here are the issues-A) sky did nothing on the 23rd to cancel our order and reinstate a new order at that time. Now we are a week behind.B) their rep incorrectly advised sky had the order and could install todayC) apparently it is impossible for them to expedite anything because they use a 3rd party for installation and they can’t even expedite the 24-48hours it takes for their OWN internal “cancellation team” to push a button. We were literally at a loss for words. Such a bizarre experience. All the rep did was apologise but was unable to provide any solutions or ways to make this an improved situation. Meanwhile, we are paying for extra data everyday as we work from home and critically need WiFi! We asked to speak with her manager, and she advised she would need to email her as she is working from home. How does sky not have a better way of escalating issues to managers by phone? We have all been working from home for months now, the fact that sky is working from home should not have impact on me as a customer and their organisation needs to ensure WFH process do not impact their customers. Who knows if we will get a call from the manager? As an aside- Sky needs to get up to speed with the times in the UK- no idea why they are using a 3rd party monopoly for installation considering they are SKY, and no idea why they use gastly satellite dishes like we are stuck in the 90s. Already infamously ugly housing in the UK is made even uglier with their dishes. Don’t get it. From the look of it, sky doesn’t read anything on here since they have 1 star- you would think they would do something about their issues if they did."
Luke,2,5,"Wow wow wow,I have used Sky many times before and left for different reasons. Today I went to sign my mother in law up for Sky tv hoping to get a better deal on the phone. Luckily I had the pleasure of speaking to Riz a complete asset to Sky. He was not only professional and knowledgeable he was friendly and warming. He gave us all the details about keeping COVID secure whilst maintaining a strong customer rapport. He offered us a better deal than what was online and made sure we were 100% before signing us up. I cannot fault him at all and makes a nice change to have someone so friendly and professional on the phone. Sky please take note on what a superb employee you have in Riz"
Jenny,5,5,"Well. I just had a call from a lovely Scottish lady called Aileen. She was cheerful, extremely polite and very helpful. I cancelled my sky and had a payment come out. I emailed and Aileen was calling to tell me she would sort my refund out for me to reach my account within 3-5 working days. She said that no one can afford to be out of pocket right before Christmas. Her manner was impeccable and she put a smile on my face, hence why I came straight on here and left a review. Well done Aileen. You should train other staff with your excellent customer service skills. One happy (x) customer 😁"
Wy,1,1,"Sky Broadband was cutting out every hour. I could not work from home properly. I called Sky countless of times, each time I had to wait 1 hour before speaking to someone. Everytime they told me the tests showed no major issues, and other than switching the router on & off, replugging wires, they did not want to send an engineer out. Finally after months of torture, an engineer finally came and found the cables outside were badly damaged.  This could have been sorted out much earlier."
Nathan Mzuza,1,1,In 2019 my virgin superfast hub 2 which i've had since 2015 sadly died on me so I went with sky this time and it was absolutely terrible sky Q is very good but the sky wifi is absolutely terrible an engineer went through all the trouble to install it to for me to get 2.3mbps when I was told 50mbps. It's now 2020 and I am getting my new virgin wifi back this thursday. Can't wait to have 1 gig not some terrible 2.5mbps.
Steve Britton,3,1,"They don’t want to talk to you! They can’t fix ongoing faults with sound on HD or UHD on sports - every other Chanel is ok normally, turn off dolby don’t watch in UHD is what they said - but I pay for it so why charge me and can’t deliver the service - also my Q mini box needs resetting every week because it is lost connection - changed my main box 2 times with used units full of other people’s recordings. The second box is just 3 mtr way in next room and keeps failing. Terrible service and products pay through nose for it and it keeps faulting repeatedly will be leaving end of contract and finding another provider for my sports! Don’t even want speak to you now check online can’t get through to them on phone! Appalling for a telecommunications tv company! Can’t communicate says it all really! Disgusted pay them over 1200 a year for many many years never been right have to have them out at least every 5-6 months for something not working!"
Yassemin Tilan,2,1,"Appalling company.Due to loss of job I have struggled to pay two bills. Fortunately I will be in a position to sort in about two weeks due to new job.However despite the Covid situation and Sky advertising they ""know customers may struggle""... Still doesn't prevent them from cutting my entire service off without allowing me to pay in increment so leaving me at home with nothing, all whilst adding on ""late charges X2"" despite ""understanding"" some people are having difficult due to unprecedented circumstances.I loved the service and was fully willing to sign up for another 18 months in May if they could keep it at a similar price however based on how they are one of the only companies I've dealt with that have not done ANYTHING to show understanding in the Covid times we are in..I am appalled and will be switching to Virgin in due course."
Andrew Weckermann,2,1,"Unless you are signing up for a new service they do not want to know.  I had a query to do with changing my order I placed and wow.  Call the sky number, use menu system to speak to sky mobile, specify you need to speak to a representative and you get the most amazing message stating that you can get all the help you need from the sky help pages and that you will be sent a text with the link and then it hangs up.  THE HELP MENUS are rubbish.  They do not contain the information I need.  So I can speak to anyone and the help pages are not helpful what can I do.????? I tried social media, Twitter, Facebook messenger who replied said I need to speak to a rep, LOL, I say I can’t get through, they say use the help pages arghhhhgggggg this is how you loose customers it seem as if sky are starting to not care about there existing customers.  I currently pay for four contracts, sky TV I would expect to speak to a person,  even the web chat feature is gone. The only way I could get through or rather nearly get through to someone was to say I was placing a new order but the team went home so no joy there.You should hang you heads in shame at the poor service you are providing. COVID is no excuse when your customers are contracted I doubt you have struggled as an enterprise even if some of your customers have taken a payment holiday. I don’t understand why sky are so against speaking to there customers."
Nicola Shaffer,2,1,"I ordered broadband and Sky TV.  They cancelled the broadband without advising me, and decided I would probably still want the TV.  I didn't care about the TV in the first place. 1 hr wait to speak to someone about it. I genuinely hope football clubs create their own TV station, because thats the only way these clowns get money."
Michelle Chambers,1,1,Cannot active discovery plus help on line is useless and they do not make it easy to call terrible customer service for paying nearly £200 per month ive been a sky customer for 20 years it’s never been this difficult to access things
Andy,7,5,"Decided to call and renegotiate package and upgrade to superfast broadband. Usually with Sky in the past, I've had to threaten to cancel to get a couple of quid off but it was painless this time. Received great service when I called a few days ago from a lady called Deepika. Not sure if it was due to the Black Friday offers but who cares! Called support line today too for help with the new router. Apart from waiting 30mins in a queue, service was brill and the guy sent out a free booster for a part of the house that gets rubbish signal. Both calls were really good this week. (apart from the queue for net support). Cheers Sky!"
Ciaran Mc Closkey,2,1,"I am paying 50 a month for 4mbps WiFi. I rang monday 23rd about it and the representative said a new box would fix it and be out on Tuesday. On Tuesday it never arrived. I rang again and lady on phone could not tell me anything, when it was dispatched etc. She could however tell me it would be out the following day. Wednesday still no sign. Friday rang was left on hold for an hour to it then hang up. Saturday rang and representative said it would be out today. Still no sign. The reason I rang about broadband was because I have been offered rates by Eir and imagine, so customer service like this only entices me more to switch. What is going on?Where is my modem box?How do I cancel my package?I am forced to write comments on your Facebook as your online chat and email service is nowhere to be seen. Make a call to you and your left an hour to be hung up on?If you weren't wearing suits you'd be arrested."
Maryan,14,1,"Too much to talk about. If someone told me they are $h!T I was about to stay away from them. After signing the contract, they have raised the bill for £4 instantly. I have never received the promised broadband speed. Reporting few times, they claim to send an ""engineer"" and sort it out. Still nothing. Guys, I have no time to sit on a phone for 3 hours to wait for someone to answer. Customer unhappy."
Eveline Engo,1,1,Sky has chared me $46.34  on the fifth of November  and  twenty egift of November am sick and tried am not going to pay  on December the fifth because  they have chared me twice and sky message  me back by eveline Engo
Beth Bartle,6,1,"Absolutely awful. I do not know what has happened to Sky this year but I will never have a contract with them again. They have been writing to me all this year warning of a charge for equipment which I returned. I spoke to somebody at Sky earlier this year and he told me to ignore the warnings and I wouldn't be charged. 2 days ago I called, having to go through sales in order to get through, and was told, after he admitted that it was in the notes on file that his colleague had said this that I still had to pay it. After saying that my husband is a Solicitor he told me it would be refunded. No refund.Today I get a letter from bpo collections.This is great news as they are now in breach of contract."
Gerry O’Brien,1,1,This is probably the worst company world wide for customer service. I am with sky nearly 15 years. 4 weeks ago in the middle of a lockdown with limited things to do a message came up on my screen. This viewing is not authorised I checked my account all paid up. Spent two days while at work trying to get through. No answer. It would be easier communicate in the evening when a customer gets home. Guess what that can’t happen no even online I finally did speak to some clown in customer service and gave him my viewing card number and he told me he would order one. 3 weeks later no card. There has been a lot of sport on channels over the past few weeks that we havent seen. There has been absolutely no follow up call either. This is not good enough. I am hoping to hear from somebody very early tomorrow morning. Sorry there is now customer support over the weekend. I might get a call Monday. I am expecting at least 6 months complimentary sky TV and a new viewing card Tuesday of next week I’m not holding out.
Dobbo,1,1,Disgusted with the customer service and loyalty. We have been with sky for over 10 years. The Internet broke for three weeks and I have had to negotiate a refund for the loss of service. Of which they offered me £8 and then upped it to £10 via text message. They have sent a £15 goodwill gesture. We will not be staying with sky when our contract renews. To only offer £25 for a failed service is shocking. The fact you have to call them back after the issue is fixed is unreal too surely they should contact you to apologise for the failing service.
Robert Daniels,10,1,Been with sky for 16 years no loyalty to customers . Recently moved abroad and had to cancel my subscription still got charged for leaving . Never again will I have sky
Princely,86,1,"Terrible Service, sky took almost double my monthly payment and when i called they said my contract was coming to an end soon. I said so what? that does not give you the right to take money from my account without notice.  The girl said they do not contact people for sky tv packages and only for broadband packages! a load of nonsense if you ask me.   There is no excuse whatsoever for not being able to get in touch, no emails, no letters, no phone calls, no nothing!!  I have the complete package and it looks like i wont be having it anymore unless they contact me to resolve this sorry mess.  We have Netflix, Youtube, Smart TV and the internet to what pretty much whatever we want without paying for anything so you think sky would be providing a better service. Use to be good, now Virgin, BT, Netflix and others are doing a better job.  Also whats Covid got to do with customer service? sky has lost its touch and is way down the line compared to other companies now."
nusrat pola,6,1,I’m actually appalled by their customer service. Misleading information and delayed service installation with no update
R Grady,3,5,"Moving house so used their house move option on their website.Really easy to use.Able to get in contact with someone as soon as needed. Person on the phone very helpful, polite and professional. Due to delays in competion date I had to move my house set up, this was very easy to do and very straightforward. Good experience."
SD Hughes,13,1,"I am 21 year subscriber but I doubt I will be a  22 year subscriber.  The service is just too awful to describe and no, I do not make allowances for interruptions due to Covid.  There is no excuse whatsoever for not being able to get in touch with Sky.  Home working, email response and wait for it - LIVE CHAT even.  Wake up Sky, you are like a nationalised failing company"
Larissa M Ihara,2,1,"It's Friday morning and the Openreach engineer came to install my Sky broadband. However, as he was drilling through the wall to pass the cables, he drilled through the Sky TV cables. When I went online to book an engineer, the earliest date available was the Saturday, but I'd have to pay for the visit!! So I called customer service and they said I didn't have to pay for a weekend visit, but the earliest slot available was the Sunday morning. In conclusion: I'll have to wait two whole days for them to come fix their own service provider's screw-up!"
MRS DOROTHY A BOWDEN,3,5,"In my 70s moving house in the middle of a pandemic!The one bright star on the horizon was Ahmad, my Sky adviser. I was dreading setting up Sky Broadband and TV from scratch in my own name but he couldn’t have been more helpful or more patient. I’m reasonably tec savvy but take a little longer to think these days! He took me through it all, very clearly and simply, step by step at my own pace, not asking all the time “have you done that”? But waiting for me to say “ok”. Everything has gone exactly as he said it would and I am now the proud owner of my own great Black Friday Deal Sky system."
Neil poultney,1,1,"If you are able to speak to someone at sky you deserve a medal 🏅 I have suffered with slow broadband speeds since day one. Rang customer services to wait on hold to then be redirected back to website by way of text message. I was then contacted by sky to see if I wanted to pay extra to insure my sky box and router. An opportunity to discuss my problems ? The care advisor stated she would put me straight through but in fact just cut me off. No email contact, no sky chat, and no customer support at all ! Avoid at all costs. 1.4 stars overall you cannot afford to ignore the masses."
Rusu Andrei,1,1,"Trying call sky everyday , nobody answer I just started contract with them and they never came fix the cable  I need to stay with my broadband in the attic. Very bad staff very bad .."
Jed Mcguire,1,1,"I have cancelled my Sky subscription, having been with Sky since day one.One of my main reasons for having Sky was to watch cricket.This summer Sky decided to introduce politics into their sports coverage, particularly cricket. Whether one agrees with their politics or not, is not the issue. We already get politics rammed down our throats by the mainstream media 24 hours a day.To now also get it on the Sports channel, for me is step to far, and a poor call by Sky.Additionally, SkyNews no longer provides news, it just churns out a constant stream of negative propaganda. IThe deterioration of Sky coincides with it being taken over by the American multi national corporation Comcast. Comcast, through Sky, is now trying to set the political agenda in the UK and elsewhere, while dishing out bread and circuses for the peasants.The mainstream media really are out of touch.'Thanks but no thanks'.Freesat is a better option now."
MJY,3,1,"I've been a customer with Sky for four years now, and over the past few months I've seen a significant decline in my broadband speed.On speaking to two (very lovely and friendly) customer advisers, it was confirmed that as I was 'out of contract' (but still paying them £30 per month...) that I'd either need to sign up for another 12 month contract (which I can't do as I plan to move away next year) or pay £65 for an engineer visit. When I'm paying them monthly for a sub-par service, that's quite ridiculous.Whenever I've spoken to them, I've been sold to heavily to try and convince me to sign up for more expensive fiber packages."
adi bayuaji,3,1,"I have canceled the sky bundled in August. They advised me not to do anything and will stop sending me a bill. Apparently, Sky just canceled only broadband and Phone! They keep charging me for the TV that I didn't even use. I have called Sky, and as usual, they cannot do anything, not even refund for the extra 2 month TV bill that I didn't even use. Please be careful with this scam if you want to cancel your subscription, don't trust them. Just cancel your direct debit straight away."
Ula Garlińska,1,1,"I've been with SKY over 2 years. Little one bed flat in the victorian house. Despite having two extenders for the wifi signal to improve, it was crap! I could not connect my TV to the WiFi at all. I've been told repeatedly by engineers that bricks in my house are too thick and signal can't spread between them - what a load of lies. I've just connected new kit from Talk Talk, everything started working straight away. Wifi doesn't need extender to reach my front room anymore!"
AJ M,2,1,"terrible experience with them, especially when leaving.all they want is $$person was nice, but you see how this organisation works and they should be ashamed of themselves. I was calling on behalf of a pensioner to help them out, and I was actually wondering what it would have been like if I wasn't helping out.they have no shame in taking advantage and basically putting issue onto the customer when their own system doesn't work well."
Philip,2,1,"possibly the worst utlility/comms company for customer service I have ever experienced. Not even their own staff can get hold of them. And their tech support is so badly 'joined up' that it has taken 5 visits to correct a problem. on 3 of them they have the 'wrong kit, wrong team' They claim to prioritise key works and people with tech pre-existing problems but this is clearly flannel. It is IMPOSSIBLE to get a person on the phone and their website deliberately makes it difficult to achieve what's required."
R. Lang,2,1,I closed my account with sky in mid October and was told I'd get a refund on the 5th November. Instead of that they charged me another month's subscription for a property I no longer live at. They don't answer emails and I've now had to cancel my direct debit to stop them charging me again in December. Total nightmare of a company to communicate with.
Rashell hodge,7,2,wel am sick of the tv channels you get from sky total drivel all repeats there is never anything on and far too many adverts ..drives you insane
Paul Swift,1,1,To start with is a company who does not accept calls to downgrade or cancel subscription but yet if you require a upgrade or wish to join with sky you straight away get through to a operator why is it that a company gets away with such a policy
Martin,6,1,"Dont use this company.Absolutely shocking from Sky. Ordered a phone, the phone had problems from day one. Cancelled within 14 days and get told to do nothing and they will get back to me and then refund me when the phone has been returned. They sent a return package to my parents house (from where i had to move out of during lockdown) So the return envelope got mixed up it their post as my dad has the same name and had recently cancelled a sky installation as they kept cancelling every time they were due to install. So though the envelope was for him. Eventually i received it and it was self stamped to be taken to a post office. But i refused to go into them during the pandemic because of the queues and trying to social distance. In the end after trying to get though to sky with no luck and wasting countless hours being on hold i decided to pay for a courier and send it back myself. They are now saying i didnt send it back quick enough (although there was no mention on the returns information of when it had to be back by) So i get a phone call saying that although they received the phone back they are going to keep billing me for the next 3 years for the cost of the phone, and send it back to me to keep. Even though it's their network that is the problem where i work. They have already taken nearly £70 from my bank for rent on a phone they have back and wanted to keep charging for the next 3 years. I've cancelled the direct debit and contacted them. But again no reply for the last 5 days and no live chat and no answering their phones. An absolute disgrace of a company."
Anth,11,1,Absolute shambles of a company  wouldnt recommend them as they always increasing prices and there sky q malarky is absolute rubbish . So they give customers second hand sky q boxes when they want the rubbish tech back .
Chris,18,1,"Just an utterly miserable experience getting through to Sky by phone nowWas looking to upgrade but just ran out of enthusiasm waiting for someone in Delhi to answer the phone. Miserable. Suitably unimpressed review posted.Genuinely no one is really that bothered. Will leave next year, as soon as I'm out of contract, for Amazon"
Disgruntled,1,1,"Appalling service, terrible customer agents, extortionate prices and snail's pace broadband. A con - if you can use ANYONE else, anyone at all, use them instead of Sky."
Gordon Mace,2,1,"They decided to increase the monthly fee a few months ago, so I've let them know that I will not continue my contract because of that, and simply cancelled the direct debit to make sure they won't charge further. By law, I'm entitled to leave a fixed term contract if this happens.There was one request to pay some £20+, a last bill, that I did. Since then, thought, I keep getting emails from various debt collectors asking me to pay a £20 debt towards Sky. I'm s nding these to the spam folder for now, but seriously thinking to file a report for harassment."
A MacGregor,8,1,"If it were possible to leave less than 1 star I certainly would. I have tried today to obtain a username and password for my broadband service as I do not have any intention of using the hopeless sky Q router they have sent me. It has been a complete waste of time as they refuse to assist, it is not that they are unable to, simply that they refuse to. First lady was obviously having difficulty hearing me or understanding plain English as I had to repeat myself several times before she finally got the message and refused to help as she was not from the technical team. Unsurprisingly I asked to be transferred to the technical team only to find the technical staff do not have the ability to help as they are prohibited from assisting customers in this way. This lady sent me a link to a forum where sky users have shared information on how to do the exact thing I want to which is use a router with the facilities and capacity to do what I want, such as set up a site to site IPSec VPN. It seems to me that Sky's management either think their customers are too stupid to operate a router or they are trying to save money by employing cheaper staff that they do not need to train as everything is done for them. Either way it is a woefully inadequate company that does not deserve the money we pay them. I will attempt to achieve connecting my router to the broadband and if I am unable to use Sky's service due to their unnecessary restrictions I will cancel my broadband service and move to a competent supplier."
Lee Smith,1,1,I wouldn’t even give it 1 star as it’s absolutely shockingI’ve been given 5 different installation dates now and told same reason time and time again Even got a manager last time who assured id be rung in the Sunday pre appointment and then rung on the Monday when installed and no calls returned !!!!  Phoned them Monday evening and useless again. Even worse this time. She didn’t even know what to say.  Lied on the phone to me and even said he’s been trying to ring me while I was on the phone with her ???? But she can’t speak or contact him or put me through to him Wtaf!!!! How does she know he’s been trying to ring ?? I can honestly say I’ve never received as bad a customer reservoir as I’ve had from sky After 5 separate situations and raising it further I haven’t moved on 1 bit Useless
Ralph W,3,1,"Terrible. TV due for installation last Friday, no show by the engineer. Later called by customer services saying they couldn't find the property. Subsequently had it installed today. Turn it on this evening for first time and half the services/channels we subscribed for aren't working. Haven't been able to log in to online account since Saturday. Automated telephone message telling me it will be unlocked and please be patient for the last 3 days. Have now been on hold 40 mins to customer services without success. Will be cancelling my direct debit tomorrow if I'm not able to speak to someone in the next 24 hours."
Miss E Hinde,3,1,Took my money sent my card then no show to fit box no refund
David Cooper,7,1,Cant get to speak to anyone . Been phoning for a week . On hold each time for 30 to 45 minutes and I end up getting annoyed and hang up . Must have phoned  20 times now .
Mohammad Rashid,1,1,"Due to Covid 19, my telephone attempt to renew or terminate the earlier contract to avoid default rated payment, which expired on 20 May 2020, failed on a number of occasions, resulting in continiously incurring default rate £42 montbly. Sky telephone service prevented me to reach cancellation/renewal department. Unless you are a key worker, you could not have reached the desired department. Meanwhile, following the fault reporting in Feb (old Sky HD+ box stopped working), an engineer-visit was booked in March. The engineer visit eventually took place on 08 August due to Covid 19. As opposed to a normal external engineer, Sky internal and senior engineer arrived this time. She explained to me that they no longer provide Sky+HD box and that Sky Q was the only option. She further explained that since my building does not have equipment ofQ box compatibility, the job was assigned to her specially. She worked for 3 hours to set up macinaries for compatibility of Sky Q box and eventually succeeded in installing the Sky Q box in my flat. However, before she would start doing all these, she particularly required me to agree a renewal contract which I did for £21 in place of £22 (previous contract that had expired in May) . Contract included ULTRA HAD SKY Sports, in particular.However, we did not check ULTRA HD option until Premier League started. I discovered when Premier League started that ULTRA HD was not working; new contract was ignored; and Sky continued with the default contract to charge me the default contract rate £42.We felt disappointed to learn that the new contract was not recorded. We understood it must have been an error. We complained to honour the contract as from 8 August and requested refund of the price-difference for the period 20 May and 08 August. After a long saga, only £20 (one month of the price-difference) was refunded, in place of 4 months. Not only that, Sky unequivocally denied the contract. In my understanding it is a breach of contract.I asked Sky to contact the engineer but Sky advised me that engineer is untraceable. We then terminated Sky service on or around 25 September.I received an outbound call on or around 17 November to restore Sky service at my home. Clearly again, we agreed a deal for Sky Sports ULTRA HD for £30 with first month free nad £50 cash back. Correct box arrived on Friday, but contrary to our telephone agreement, I discovered again that ULTRA HD was not recorded to be part of contract.Again, I called the customer service who advised me that I ordered ULTRA HD box but my did not order Ultra HD service. I have now terminated the service again within the cooling off period. Based on my 20 years experience with Sky and in particular the current experience, I beleive that the repetation of same breach must be a part of, or at least must have been facilitated by, Sky's internal (undisclosed) policy, which I condemn seriously."
Happy Chappy,13,1,Just shocking service all round my sky q box isn’t working and I can’t get any help whatsoever.been without it for months Fix it yourself seems to be their policy just keep paying the bill!!I thought virgin were bad but at least they answer the phone!!
Dipesh Ruparelia,1,1,"This company is absolutely a joke and I wished I never switched to them. They offer a switch credit whereby if you switch to sky and you have to pay early termination charges to your old provider, sky will credit this back to you. I had to pay my old provider just under £30.00. I emailed the switching team with proof of letter from old provider showing amount (attached letter via PDF), screen shot of mobile app showing payment has debited, sky account number and full name and address. I keep getting auto response back saying they need this information again. You ring sky and get passed from department to department. The sky switch credit team does not take inbound calls. This has gone since 11th October 2020. What a joke!!!!!!"
Wendy Slade,1,5,"I am not a customer of Sky but I recently had to ring them to notify them that my mother had passed away and we needed to cancel the TV, phone and broadband accounts. My call was answered immediately with no waiting in lengthy queues by a lovely lady called Louise in the bereavement team. She deserves a special mention in how she dealt with the issue in a kind, caring and polite manner and even took the time to call me back as I needed to sort out some paperwork before I could close the account. I was impressed enough with her customer service only to be amazed a few days later when a small bouquet of flowers was delivered from the bereavement team at Sky. I was so touched and it brought a little rainbow into my day despite it being a very difficult time for me and my family. Thank you so much!"
Fiona Brookes,3,1,"Sky are bloody useless and crap 💩 I rejoined sky back in February 2019 taking out a package offer of £42.20 a month for sky broadband sky talk and sky tv on a 12 month contract -  in august 2020 they increased the payment for all the above services to £67 with out giving me any notification of the increase of the new payment price so I cancelled all the services and contact with sky on the 7 august 2020, receiving a letter to two days later saying sky was cancelled and asking for us to send the sky Q box back which we sent back on the 9th august 2020 - sky are now claiming that the sky tv service is still active and that we owe them £80  - how can we owe them that amount when we cancelled all services with them and sent them the sky Q box and router back ?!!  - somebody in their office hasn’t done their job right bloody useless idiot  !!  When we did have sky we kept losing tv signal with them every time it rained or the weather was bad due to our location of being out in the sticks of the countryside - sky are quick enough to take your money off you but they provide a very poor quality of service and value for money service and has for getting in touch with their customer service team for anything you’ve more and better change of contacting the good lord jesus  and talking to him and receiving a reply and help off Jesus than sky  !!For £30 a month you can get unlimited broadband internet service  talk landline telephone service  TV service which includes free  YouTube / Netflix and Apple TV channels  all provided by Vodafone - who’s services are far cheaper than sky more reliable quicker broadband internet speeds better coverage and far better customer services quality than what I ever received from sky !!"
Consumer,1,1,"Been with Sky 22yrs, now I’m moving home and need to change my address in different area .. but they (Sky) were unable to give me the same deal or similar one around the same price. As an oap, my budget was minimal, but Sky wanted more money and really were unhelpful to meet my budget, so I had no choice but to leave Sky after being such a loyal customer and Sky weren’t even bothered, so disappointed Sky don’t care for there lower end customers."
Julie Laurent,13,1,"Spoke to Dean in TV subscription dept, I wanted to be in the cancellation dept.  Once again I say again corporations like Sky and the rest you are only as good as the person who answers the phone and nine times out of ten you’ll be unlucky with the person your talking to who has know idea what they are talking about but these companies always insist on taking your money.  The whole thing is so so sad, I think I’ll go back to standard TV and Netflix separate it’s easier and more straight forward just looking for decent broadband"
Mr Dave Fisher,6,1,Dreadful don't go there. Waiting two months for Sky Tv and been cancelled again for another month. Cannot use the home phone number and they don't know why. Customer service awful and when you get through they transfer you and I have been dumped off the line 3 times. I thought BT could be bad..... could be forgiven soon.
Daniel Holbrooke,1,1,"Ok where to begin.. My partner and I decided to get Sky broadband on 16th of October. The first guy we spoke to Jordan, convinced us we should cancel our Now tv, and go for the all in onevbroadband and tv package(even tho we only wanted broadband).He was unable to correctly enter my very easy icloud email address or add the deals and price reductions he promised. The tv was set up no problem, but our broadband was cancelled for no reason at all, and bill was higher than we were told. We spent at least 1 hr trying to speak to someone from sky, and when we finally did, we were passed between 6 people/departments. We found out it was a system error on their part. So we rang another 2 times after being cut off. We were told we then had to wait another week until we could reorder our broadband( all the while charging us for our tv, double the price of now tv for the same channels). After re-order of broadband and a new date of set up, low and behold our broadband got cancelled again. So we phoned and same deal, spoke to so many different people, with litterally all having no idea how to sort out our issue, using covid as an excuse. Keep being told open reach are to blame, yet not told why and no advice at all on how to sort the issue. Told they can see our notes, then they cant, then we had to reorder, then its cancelled, all rather unprofessional and ridiculous in all honesty. How hard is it to set up a new broadband connection in a new house, with entirely new customers. We've cancelled everything with sky now and we urge everyone to do the same, not impressed, if i could give negative stars i would give them minus 5.awful company procedure/shamefully inadequate training of staff, with quite frankly poor customer service ability. Oh and expect hidden charges after being told several times there are none, literally no transparency with what they say.UPDATE: have now gone with BT, very easy set up. They informed me that our house was part of that 10%of houses that have a fibre line connection already in place. They said  that Sky would have never been able to set up the Internet in our house, as they are the only ones that supply this line in the UK.They also informed me that Sky would have known this, as it would show this information on their system. So i can only guess that the advisor at sky just really wanted us to sign up for TV,and knowing we already had Now Tv,chose to not tell us about the Internet connection. Not good is it to be honest. Anyhow go with BT if you get chance alot less hassle"
Syd Sardar,1,5,"My Sky Engineer Was Very Good His Name Is ARRON .Great Service , Very Good Manners , JUST GREAT GUY,Credit To Sky ."
Gary Clarke,1,1,Sky believe in better..... If only I couldBeen a member since 1988 I have been having somee signal issues for some time and phoned up on wednesday after sky tring to fix it over the phone they decided I would need a new box A q box I was told aand the day was set for today Saturday between 10 - 5 I waited till 15:00 and as I had not heard from them I thought I would give them a call only to be told dont worry its all still going a head at 16:20 I phoned again and was told again dont worry its all still going a head I said its getting dark are you sure if they have to change the dish dont worry I was told we have sent them a mesage and they will get back to you at 16:58 a sky enginer turned up and said it was too dark to install it.I understand they can not work in the dark but when you have called 2 times expressing your concerns its very very poor serviceNow im going to have to wait another 2 days fingers crossed
GDH,2,1,"Absolutely appealing customer service. They used to have decent customer service a few years back. I recently got Sky Q and there have been all sorts of problems. It's nearly impossible to get hold of a human being,  you always get directed to 'visit their website where 90% of issues can be resolved'. Yeah but what about the 10% that cannot be resolved? That's right, a 30 minute wait to speak to a jobsworth who has no idea what they're doing awaits you. Realistically you need to set aside a half day to deal with these morons to sort out the simplest task. Complete waste of time and money."
DD,1,1,Paying over £100 a month having major issues with sky Q box cannot get to speak with anyone over 45 mins on phone just listening to music rubbish service
Sharon Duffy,6,1,Dreadful customer service now on day 3 of trying to diesel up an adviser the automated bit is useless and today got an advisor after 20 mins wrong department so am now at 30 mins and losing the will to live 🤬
Guy Michels,3,1,"Engineers missed intial appointment to connect broadband, with no prior warning and no reason was given as to why. Then had to wait two more weeks for internet, which is not ideal in a working from home environment. Was connected we have had shocking internet speed, constantly dropping off. Don’t even get me started with their customer service, worst I’ve encountered with any business. Avoid at all costs!"
Mr Matthew Paul Gallagher,4,1,"RIP-OFF SKY TV WHO ABUSE LOYALTYFor the past year I’ve had a lot of problems with sky TV. We moved onto skyQ after they claimed, “the mini boxes are WiFi boosters” and from the get go we had connectivity issues, buffering during live TV, couldn’t watch recorded items and watching a downloaded movie forget it. In 2 of our rooms we gave up using the mini boxes as they didn’t work (and we were paying for them)!We had so many visits from sky engineers. Each one in turn altered the previous engineers work and blamed them for not doing the right thing to correct the issues. Customer service who promised to call me back didn’t on many many occasions . I’ve been passed from pillar to post, lied to, misinformed, mislead and mistreated. They moved us into a ‘WiFi expert package’. “Yes mr gallagher our experts will be with you within the week, and any problems with WiFi will be remedied”. A few weeks later a lovely lady came round. She removed the 4 boosters they’d sent, yes that’s 4 boosters. She left having “sorted the mesh”, she said. Following day we were back to square 1. Another engineer visited the same week. He roamed around the house, dodged the fact that I’d said the mini boxes needed hard wiring. He poo poo’d everything that the WiFi expert had done. Moved a booster 6 foot into another socket and said he’d resolved it. Same day we were back to the same position. He was singularly the most obnoxious sky engineer to-date. Then broadband stopped. 11 days later open reach dug up the soft verge saying squirrels had chewed the wire. During this period we had no phone and no broadband. To cope with 2 key workers requirements for data we spent £77 just to have the ability to work. Plus we had no WiFi or ability to use sky they have offered £52. During this period we were lied to, mislead and misinformed by numerous sky calls centre staff. Eventually after over a year I managed to talk to a manager and escalated my complaint. They asked me to think about what compensation would look like. So, over the 20 years we calculated  we’d probably given sky over £22,000.00 (conservative figure). This year alone just over £1700.00.We’ve not had service or a product that’s worked. So, we thought they should refund this years contract £1700.00 or at least come close to it.Oh No. Just got off the phone having been kicked royally in the teeth - £100.00, Yes £100.00. This huge monster corporate giant whom control media, politics, sport , people’s activities and entertainment, (our lives basically). £100.00 for over a year of stress and a product which hasn’t worked at all.Take them down the ofcom route?, forget it. The process doesn’t favour the ‘man on the street’ I’m afraid. If you’ve nothing to do ready sky’s appeals process in complaints!Needless to say I’m done, I’m out, I’m bitter and upset. Feeling used and robbed for being loyal for over £20 years. There is nothing more disapponinting than being ripped off and undervalued as a human being, and the problem is sky do not care in the slightest. I’ve always felt over a barrel subscribing to sky, and tied in having their email, land line and TV. But now they’ve actually screwed me over so much I can’t wait to get another provider!!"
Gareth Bale,2,1,"Wanted to switch from BT to sky, what a NIGHTMARE. The order got cancelled 3 times first time because they tried to port forward a number in a completely different area to where I live???The 2nd & 3rd time no one could give me a definitive answer. I spent a total of over 15 hours on phone calls trying to get this supposed “hassle free” switch sorted.Eventually my BT got stopped by sky and then Sky failed my order again so now I am in lockdown trying to work from home with 2 young children who depend on network connections to do school activities with no broadband connection. I am needless to say LIVID with the level of service from sky. Automatic compensation of £35 is all they could offer. No interim help with a connection (such as 4G router) was offered whilst I would have to wait for another 2 weeks for the order to go through again.I have now cancelled the order as Sky have completely lost my confidence.I cannot tell you the stress this has put me under. I wish I never switched. I have since contacted BT which will now take up to 2 weeks to get re-connected however they are sending me a 4G mini hub to tide me over until I get my broadband back (Sky: make a note of this...especially as you stopped my connection, it’s called customer service).On top of this deal was a swap from HD to SkyQ...... The engineer fitted the box and later that day the box was faulty (speckled screen). I rang to get this sorted and had to wait 10 days for another engineer. Turned out the box was faulty. This whole ordeal was absolute pantomime  and during this pandemic makes things worse.If virgin was available in my area I would switch immediately just out of principal."
Jasmine Mohid,1,1,"Moving to London opposite hyde park opposite royal Lancaster hotel I thought sky would be the best broadcaster but it has been horrible.Paying £60 a month since 2019 we have not one day of any channels.They sent service men who blamed the apartments antennas, other reasons and could not fix it.Then comes lock down. We get all channels clearly for 6 months.As soon as lockdown is lifted our service stops.!!! No channels nothing.bizarre?!!We were told lies. That our systems are at fault.Weare cancelling right away and switching 'hopefully' to BT .lets see."
Lee Shacklady,4,1,"Absolutely pathetic.Had no WiFi for 4 weeks, ring up and the people at the other end of the phone don't even know there own name.Not getting anywhere."
Test Test,1,1,Having been a long standing customer with sky as I was promised existing customers will get better offers the longer they stay with sky than new customers. Turned out to be false they increased the amount I pay twice on my package and never been given any decent offers. I told them about a offer they have for new customers and wanted them to match it but they said they couldn’t. I ended up cancelling the package and they didn’t even bat an eye lid. It’s a company for new customers not loyal customers.
Amanda Powell,2,1,"I have been paying for sky for over 30 years. When I moved 18 months ago on my own , I made it clear I wanted the cheapest package , they have charged me between 70 and 90 every month .In the middle of the night , sky stops working for a couple of hours , I had many calls to them about this , and was guided through various things to do , none of them worked , over a year later it’s still the sane.I have been struggling lately to pay my bills with Covid , and I missed a payment to sky , within a few days they cut me off , meaning I had no tv at all.How crazy is this , I tried to call several timed to speak to someone, but a voice mail does not allow you to speak to anyone until you have paid your bill !!!Couldn’t even do it on the tv because of being cut off .Not allowed to speak to anyone unless I pay over 75 pounds ?????!!!!I had to borrow the money , and I see today without permission they have taken another 78I don’t have sport or broadband with them, is this bill actually possible ???My broadband is separate with btOh yes I have tried several times to cancel my subscription to be told rudely that it’s tough I can’t !"
Steve in Guildford,3,1,"Truly dreadful customer service, tried all online options, out of desperation tried phoning, should have known better...two attempts to navigate the phone options, each one resulting in Sky hanging up the call, then got into a huge queue...am still there after 20 minutes"
Sarah,1,5,"Today we had 2 engineers come to install a new SKY box at seperate times. First one came to do inspection- introduced himself, take off his shoes before to enter the house!!!! Then the 2nd engineer came, he also introduced himself,put on disposable shoe-covers  the whole time he needed to come in the house again and again, he did the same measures!!! Both gentlemen were professionally and exceptionally polite... The mannerism and professionalism both displayed was outstanding. I would like to make a confession- of all the service providers that have been to our house, I have not seen the level of professionalism I have witnessed today..."
duncan darroch,3,1,"Decided to renew our sky package a couple of weeks ago. The new package required Sky to deliver a new sky Q box, they also requested the old box back. Shortly after agreeing the new package, we received a flurry of email confirming everything including when the new box would be delivered and the old one collected. DPD arrived a day early, so nothing was ready. DPD said no problem we'll come back, except they didn't. Apparently they were requested to return the box to Sky by Sky. We are now 2 weeks later, DPD supposedly still haven't delivered the box back to Sky. Until the box arrives back, Sky refuse to ship a new one. We have now spoken to customer services 3 times, 1 was exceptionally rude and refused to put me through to his manager, the second promised to phone back and didn't. The third is saying it's possible that we could be paying for the service for the next 18 months without the box ever being delivered. He is also refusing to put us through the management or take responsibility for fixing the issue. Cancelation appears to be the only route out of this. Give me strength."
Lima,7,5,"Spoke to a lovely lady called Nargis based in Glasgow today. She was so patient and answered all my questions. I was quite indecisive and went back and forth several times. Nargis was friendly, explained everything really well. I’ve never spoken to a sales person who reads the t&cs without sounding like a robot !!! She should be used as an example and for training other members. Thanks again !!"
Mrs.  Baxter,3,1,"I have tried calling Sky twice today, both times I was on hold for nearly 40 minutes and then it just cuts out. I am now not even able to get through to the number provided from my mobile.  I was however able to get through from my landline and all I want to do is talk to someone.  I went online to see other ways of contacting them; their online chat is not available, I am unable to email them and their phone number provided comes up as ""call failed"", so I literally have to hand write, in this day and age, a letter!  How very archaic... and this is what I get as a service for £100+ a month!!!!!!!!"
Sue Beadle,1,1,"Following breaking my leg I advised Sky in Sept that I needed to cut some of my costs for a while.  They offered a minimum cut or I could cancel, I chose the cancel option thinking that I could go back after a couple of months. I received the packaging to return the sky box, which gave me until 28th December to return everything. Never was I advised that the box would be switched off and I would be left without tv. When i eventially got through I was given the impression I was stupid for not knowing that this was going to happen.  I wish that I could cancel the rubbish internet aswell but in contract till May.  So angry and frustrated"
Naomi,4,3,Sky is great when it actually works!Me and my husband are both gamers and having sky broadband is great the last couple of months sky has been awful. No internet connection! Also not helpful if you are working from home or doing online courses.
Al Jan,6,1,Got weak connection. Been told need engineer cost me 15£
James,5,1,Sky internet down again 2nd time today 3rd time in a week glad im leaving them rubbish Internet rubbish speeds
fiona mccarthy,1,1,Dont even want to put a star for this joke of a company over charging all the time internet is allways slow and customer service is a joke
Jonathan Goodswen,5,1,SHOKCING rang them up to say how terrible the connection was. They switched the broadband on to another Chanel and somehow managed to make the WiFi worse. Absolute joke. When it’s not cutting out every hour it’s a slow as an obese snail
Steve,32,1,"Crxp. 1. Overbilling - still doing this years later. Thought I'd give them another try but the same old scamming is already occurring2. They sent tons of emails when I joined. Then when I complained about billing and asked for a paper trail they facetiously wrote that they would only deal with my complaint via telephone (ha ha - we all know why these dodgy companies do that).Sky, don't bother writing a tedious ''get in touch with us'' response. Everyone knows that's just saving face for new customers and you write fob off emails and refuse to leave a paper trail to customers to try to avoid legal action. Pathetic. Don't go with Sky, they still increase your bill without you adding a jot"
Mimi Warner,21,1,Sky keeps dropping put continuously. You can’t contact Sky. Been trying all day. Keep getting cut off. The customer service is atrocious
Barry Taylor,15,1,"I cannot complain about my Sky Broadband as it is reliable but is overpriced if you are silly enough not to renew your contract at the end of each term (like me).  Sky TV is poor when you consider you pay for a premium service but have to endure 20 mins of adverts each hour.  Netflix is easier to use and much better value for money as there are no adverts, or equipment charges and no contract.My real beef is customer service I have wanted to review my TV and broadband contract for some months now but have been unable to do so as the online facility to do so has not functioned for months and the telephone wait time is always given as 30 mins, to cut to the point I endured the wait time today which proved to be 45 mins and after another 30mins with the agent I reduced my monthly cost by £20/mth with more content which is great but it has taken me months to do so and cost me almost 2 hours of my life.  Is making package change made difficult on purpose by Sky as it increases revenue? - just a thought but either way it is extremely poor customer service."
Alan kirk,28,1,"An absolute joke of a company. Took money that was not authorised and then trying to tell me there not covered by the financial ombudsman, even though they are. Just cancelled full package including multi rooms, internet and phone line and 16 years of being a customer. An absolute disgrace in customer service"
Chris Flaherty,6,1,Don’t bother this company is a joke premium price for a pp service you may as well burn your money customers service is a joke  an products when they work are slow an outdated  programs are full of adverts  out of a 45 min program expect 20 mins to be advertising
Rob Minton,2,1,Extremely poor customer service. I’ve been waiting now for a month to get broadband from sky and yet again I’ve been let down after promises that it’ll work and surprise surprise it hasn’t. How is this company still in existence!? It’s a shame I have to give one star because they really aren’t worthy of one.
Kris Anderson,1,1,"What an absolute joke. Sky is the worst broadband provider I've ever come across. I'm writing this review using my data, because yet again the WiFi has dropped. I've called them 3 times now to try and resolve the issues but all they do is send out a bt open reach engineer, and the last guy that came out said he was told there was a problem with the phone, not the broadband. He couldn't do anything to the broadband because that wasn't what he was sent out for. As a result of his completely pointless visit we're still no further forward, DO NOT GET SKY they are a bunch of stupid, useless, f**king, b*****d, c**ting, s**ting, a**eholes. And to top it all off because of this my 16 year old boys can't do their online college lessons. It is completely unacceptable to pay for sky's ""super fast"" fibre optic, and in truth 90s f**king dial up was faster. One word sums sky up, USELESS."
Shaun Butler,3,1,"IT DOES NOT WORK !!!!!!I have had SkyQ for 13 months. Brilliant WHEN it works, but that is never for long. I have been a Sky subscriber for 21 years and with the Sky HD box I NEVER watched freeview/terrestrial TV. With Sky Q I am on freeview most of the time because Sky Q DOES NOT WORK!!!!!Absolute disgrace."
Sunit Dhingra,1,1,Absolutely criminal company when it comes to refunding credits back to customers!I've telephoned them 5 times and it's been a month when I was told I was told I would receive a cheque in 5 days.CRIMINAL
Christina Nash,2,1,"I would not award a star. Been with SKY 10 years, but that is now going to enf. Customer service is a complete and utter farce. Will be returning to BT."
andrew jones,6,1,"Just signed up as a customer and will cancel, trying to speak to anyone about a broadband activation date (at the date they have issued we won’t be living there yet) is a nightmare, so far 10 calls and on my second day trying without progress. Stuck in constant loops of phone calls directing you to webpages that don’t help. I appreciate Covid has put all services under pressure but come on sky, your service is absolutely terrible."
Chris Ballard,1,1,"Left virgin media on the promise from sky of minimum download speeds of 69+mbps. Have a family of 4, 4 sky boxes and sky's fibre broadband superfast. I have made several complaints that my download speed is on a good day 8mbps and that connection is so awful that my boys tv even freezes during live sports games (channels to which I subscribe). The new customer number answers within 2 rings yet the help/complaints number gives you automated only answers. I have emailed and been told sky will call between 6.30 and 8pm and alas there is no call. I'm shocked that such a name as sky offers such awful service. Does anybody know which ombudsman I need to contact as I have recorded download speeds being achieved and wish to take this further. Sky shall not be receiving any more payments until this matter is resolved and I am compensated for the months of agony which I have endured. I couldn't recommend any company less and only request that trustpilot amend their rating system to include negative stars.C Ballard"
Wayne T,2,1,"What a shame I can't award Sky zero. After hours and hours of being on hold and being transferred from one department to another, I find that they have cancelled my broadband but then charged me an early termination fee (I was out of contract) and put me on to a new broadband package at £22 per month even though it says 'account closed'. I have been promised many times that it will be resolved, which it hasn't. I have contacted via telephone, online form, email and even a letter - still not resolved.They also had the cheek to suggest that they don't do refunds, instead credit on my TV account. Are you kidding me?!They truly are the worst company that I have ever had  to deal with. They can't even blame Covid as it was just as bed before the pandemic started - they are now using it as an excuse.Please... save your money, go elsewhere. You could subscribe to all the streaming channels and still save money compared to Sky. Once you join, they'll never let you leave!"
Matt,1,1,
Monika Akhter,1,1,"So today morning I got hacked. Someone called me pretending to be from Sky, they mentioned that my wifi was abit slow which it has been. They informed me that they will be able to fix it and I went onto my laptop as they said i would need to run a few things and next thing you know I had no control of the laptop. I realised that I was getting hacked and turned off the laptop. The person then began to swear at me and demanded me to switch the laptop back on. I was then locked out of my laptop, I called up sky and the person was actually very nice and mentioned that this happens quite alot. I have fixed my laptop but that isnt the point. The fact is that Sky dont mention these scams enough and Im sure this happens to lots of people daily. If more people were aware then we could prevent this from happening. So I think Sky should either email or send letters about the scams frequently to ensure this doesnt happen and make their customers feel safe with them."
Ken Murray,3,1,"Is it me or is Sky TV customer service becoming as bad as Eir and Vodafone?I need an engineer to call to my house and despite making five calls in the past two days I can not get to speak to a customer service operator in person! Am I alone or are others experiencing the same frustrating experience?I am continually referred to ' Sky, fix my box' and when I get there, I cannot find any page that allows me to book an engineer.Strangely enough, if you miss a payment with Sky, they are on the phone to you quicker than a bat out of hell!The attitude seems to be, 'as long as we have your money, we couldn't care less about your faults.'!"
Chris Patrick,3,1,Moved over to sky broadband 2 weeks ago and has been a nightmare. Speed consistently dips. I pay for 74mps but I'm lucky if I get 1mps. Consistently tell me they are looking into and what is happening to me is rare however seeing the reviews on here I'm not the only one having this issue. Like many others I'm working form home and Internet is essential at the moment. Yesterday my Internet went down completely and I was told I would have to wait 3 days for them to investigate before they would send an engineer. Absolute joke. I'm now switching back to BT and sky told me I could not get my money back because they provided a service. They class 1mps as an acceptable speed dispute the minimum guarantee is 50mps. Next port or call will be ofcom.
Kevin Scott,10,1,If it could be -10 it would be. Stole £100 from my account saying I hadn’t sent back my Sky Q box. That’s right I didn’t because I still use it and pay a subscription to sky.. do they want me to pay the subscription and not watch it? You cannot contact these thieves unless you are upgrading or are a new customer... using COVID-19 as an excuse to rip people off and bad customer service just got worse... TIP pay £40 for the year to a criminal and get every channel you can think of.... I now know why people do this. 11 year customer... soon as my contract ends I am out.
sarah lewis,1,1,"Broadband speeds awful despite paying for Ultrafast broadband and keeps dripping in and out. After numerous 'online tests', eventually got through to Customer Service and I don't think I've ever spoke to anyone as rude and condescending. Awful service, he could not have been more unhelpful."
Mrs H Langford,9,1,"This company is an absolute nightmare to deal with regarding customer service. The reason my parents went to Sky was to get internet, tv and phone service. They do not as yet have any access to the internet as they do not have a smart phone, laptop, tablet or computer. They do not have email. Sky wanted an email in order for them to become customers. Mine was given as I am their daughter. I received an email telling me them to phone to arrange a BT engineer. This was a recorded message directing them to Sky website to arrange an engineer. At no point could you speak to an actual person. Move on to installation day. All went well initially. However whilst the BT engineer was there they lost all connection to the TV. This man insisted that it was not his fault. My parent are elderly and self isolating. They did not know what to do and called me. After many hours of trying to get hold of Sky, constantly getting automated voice directing us once again to the internet??? when we did speak to someone we were told they could not help and to be honest I did not find them helpful as they continued to direct us with telephone lines that were automated and we were back to square one. If my parents decide to keep Sky it will be a miracle as it's taken us 8 hours to finally speak to someone to arrange an engineer to call. I would not recommend this company to my worse enemy."
Tony Murkett,1,5,"I spent over an hour on the telephone today, helped by your agent SWETHA. She was quite simply brilliant and talked me through the remedy to my connectivity problems patiently and politely. I am utterly useless at following online help & she made it all painless, culminating in successfully restoring both my Sky boxes. Thank you Swetha. Tony Murkett"
Ricki Silver,2,1,"would be minus score if possible to rate it!!!wifi been dropping for last 6month and got worse over time, impossible to get help on phone, say have not been able to track letters sent to complain, after god knows many calls etc, got hit with £50 compensation for a service at £33 a month which did not work, cost me loads in terms of financial losses for business at home-unable to use internet-skype etc, can not advise enough o avoid avoid avoid AVOID!!!  you have been warned!!!"
Rebecca Jordan,2,1,"I am utterly appalled by the service I am currently receiving from Sky. I am TV, Broadband and phone customer and have been for many years but clearly every customer is just a number and customer experience, support, service, respect and decency do not exist within this business. I moved house nearly 4 weeks ago and I still have no broadband! They have however taken my payment in advance, even though I cannot use 80% of the services I am paying for. I am told this is a 'system issue' between Sky and Open Reach and even now 4 weeks down the line they still have no update. Sky Advised me to buy a mifi box to cover the time that I haven't got any broadband and they would cover the data I am having to upload on a daily basis (currently costing £8 per day), only to be told yesterday by a different Manager that its not Sky's policy to cover data that people are having to pay for when they cant provide the service. I am a single parent, working from home due to lock down and one of my children is also self-isolating, so is having to do all her school work online. Sky do not care. They have zero empathy and can offer no solutions other than giving me a new timescale every time I speak to them. They are blocking me from escalating my complaint, I was even told at one point that if I asked to speak to a manager again the CSA would terminate my call??? I have been lied to about Sky internal processes, have been hung up on, spoken to in ways that you would not believe and there is still NO SOLUTION! I processed the home move in good time and this, I was told, would be a simple process and just a reminder again, they have charged me for this service in advance even though I cannot use it. I am told that the only way they will be able to look into my complaint, is once the broadband is up and running (WHO KNOWS WHEN THAT WILL BE??)and they are now not willing to cover the data that I am paying for (even though I have been told on numerous occasions that they will). So currently I have paid for Sky services, they are not working, I have now paid £200 + for data, I have no date for when the broadband will be working and no update. How can a business get away with treating their paying customers like this?"
I Wallace,3,1,"Sky charged me for not returning their Sky Q box at the end of the contract, The trouble is I DID return it, using Royal Mail labels and packaging provided by Sky. Cost me hours on the phone and they still took the money from my account. The money is annoying, but it's the way you get treated that leaves a bad taste."
Val,1,1,"Don’t recommend 13 years with SKY change for SKYQ and only having problems, doesn’t connect engineers are useless don’t know how to fix. They tried to con to change for SKY broadband because the SKYQ is not compatible with any other broadband provider.Don’t change to SKYQ before doing your search!!! Rubbish"
Lilly B,11,1,"Very poor service.I have had a Sky technician out twice over the past few months and a technician is coming out again today after a technician came out a few days ago.I feel like this could be a 'weekly visit'.I have had poor service from the time that I took the contract out with Sky; repetitive signal issues and loss of channels, yet they refuse to replace the dish which is 8 years old.If it were not for my disabled offspring, I would not have Sky at all.Most disappointing!"
Lou  Bryant,2,1,"I can't contact Sky and have already cancelled Broadband because of useless routers they have. I now want to cancel TV as my contract is ending but can't find relevant details in my 'mysky' account, can't complaint online because the complaints form will not accept either of my phone numbers. I have tried telephoning but can't get through etc etc etc."
Pe a,1,1,can't get the sky deal because sky was previously installed in my accommodation??
Guest House,13,1,"The sky box stopped working, so I spent about 50 minutes online asking where I should send their box and cancelling our subscription. This was April 2020.  They did not supply me with an address, so I returned their 'disfunctional'  box to them by priority mail through Colissimo on the 19th May, 2020.  Ref.CC897505575FR.  We returned the box to Sky Returns at Grant Way, Islesworth, Middlesex, TW7 5QD.  Since then they have hounded almost monthly telling me I owe them £100 for not returning the box.  I have wasted so much time and money trying to reply to these (I finally found out) no reply threats. This evening I got one only two weeks after the last threat where they are threatening legal action (IN CAPITALS) So I tried phoning (once again) and was put on hold , I was told, for a minimum of 20 minutes.  I put down and thought I should share this experience with others, but I see everyone else seems to have problems with sky as well. Six months later they are still threatening me and providing me with no means of dealing with it online, or by email. So Sky learn to put decent contact details online if you want us to use it.  Until then you now owe me £300 for postage, sitting around waiting for your staff to reply and giving up, and for threatening me on an ongoing basis with threats of legal action. You can only do that if you tell people how to reply to you.Myi terms are 30 days, so I look forward to my cheque."
Reginald Annal,17,1,What a rip of sky is I have been with them for twenty years and over that time there greed has hit new levels.My wife sent one picture message they sky charged me for eight since been refunded and built up hundreds of GBites which I wanted to use on sky store.We’re does it say you can do that if you change 5 GBites for £10 sky store voucher and spend £5 on there adverts.Getting more scummier but the day do not deserve any loyalty.
Peter Jones,4,1,"Just a message to anybody contemplating changing to the Sky Q box.  The message is DON'T, DON'T, DON'T!  It is an absolute joke of a box regardless what the Sky Customer Service team say.  The text is too small, The scroll option is awful, There are more clicks, it is clunky, it looks bad, it feels bad and it IS bad.  Called Sky to ask if I could plug my old box back in as I still have it, and the charming side of Sky that you get when they try to sell you something changed to 'You are stuck with it and wouldn't blame you if you cancelled......in 18 months time!'.  Well, after many years with Sky, and supposedly a Sky VIP, I will be cancelling in 18 months and going over to BT TV.  What an awful company!"
Przemyslaw,2,1,"After 24 months my contract has come to the end. For the next 5 months, I was paying on a monthly basis. When I called with a complaint that my BB is dropping (according to the Sky app it was an ongoing issue with my sky hub) I have been offered a new hub, HD Netflix, and all of this at a reduced price.However, nobody has mentioned that I will be entering a new contract and I have to pay for a hub delivery and administration fee! Only found out the next day when got an email from Sky. What a bunch of rogue traders there at Sky.When I contacted them that I do not want to enter a new contract and that I have not been told about it and extra costs in the first place, they decided that my broadband will be disconnected in two weeks time (I was happy to pay on a monthly basis as long as dropping broadband would be solved). Obviously I have canceled my TV services as well at this point - they will not get a dime from me anymore.Thankfully there are other providers that will be happy to take my money for the services provided."
Amelia,2,2,No internet again. Get texts to sort out the issue which never actually works. When you go get some on the phone there polite but as helpful as the text.
Sean Cooper,1,1,Sky are the worst of the worst! Customer service is awful and the most unhelpful people imaginable. They're quick enough to take your money but when it comes to providing you a service they're none existent. They automated service is crap doesn't even send you through to an advisor it just sends you a text with a link to their website which is also dreadful. It boggles my mind how they can be so careless with their service. Con artists doesn't even describe them properly. They mess you around and don't even care.
Elle Poe,1,1,"Awful service.You call them at 8.30 am and they say the lines are closed as they are open between 7am and 11pm ?!?!????Rude customer service - I had to make a complaint as they stopped my broadband as connected to the previous landline of the previous house owner?!?!I am shocked, now without internet again and they send those useless text to sort the problem yourself!!!!"
Kerri,3,4,"I would like to give Bruce specific acknowledgment from the valued customer department. We wanted to discuss our connection and our bill. With a polite, friendly and even a giggle on the phone it felt like we were talking to a friend. He sorted us out the best deal for what we wanted! Customer service was brilliant especially given the tough year everyone has had! I have given 4 stars until we await our new hub!"
Matt,1,1,Some of the worst customer experience I have ever had. Broadband WiFi is all over the place. Was on hold and a call for an hour or so then cut off whilst they are conducting checks. No call back and can’t face another 40 mins on hold before I start to speak to someone. Was with sky 10 years and switched to Virgin due to price and broadband issues. Was tempted back to Sky and so far has been very poor and will check options out for going back to Virgin as broadband was excellent. If someone from Sky reads this and wants to help then great otherwise looks like back to Virgin based on WiFi service but mostly customer service . Too much to write about the whole experience just isn’t worth it .
Puneet Vaghela,8,1,"I've just been trying to reduce my TV package because I don't watch most of the channels. If you try and do it through your account online, they purposefully take you to a broken page. If you try to contact them through social media, they brush you off. I then contacted them by telephone. After 20 minutes, my call was answered by a woman who knew full well she couldn't help me, but still wasted my time for 7 minutes before passing me off to another colleague. I've now been on the phone for an hour waiting to be connected to someone, to no avail. They honestly make it impossible for you to reduce your contract. I will be complaining to the Office of Fair Trading, The Ethics Commission and whichever Ombudsman deals with this. They are a criminal organisation that holds you hostage. It's absolutely unacceptable how they are allowed to function in this way in this day and age."
L Nizan,2,1,"We've no broadband for 3 days now. Spoke to Sky for 1h10 minutes after waiting in the queue for 30 min. All this to say that he would only book an appointment for Wednesday and that I had to take the morning off work even if that means losing my pay possibly. The guy was making jokes first about his needing to learn French because he has a French girlfriend, ha ha. Then the tone changed as he could not help at all. Worst is, somehow, that an openreach engineer was sent by Sky to our property without telling us on Friday while we were at work and he couldn't get into our property obviously. Now the guy at Sky is saying that openreach engineers do not work at all on weekends, and that if we're not home on Wednesday for our appointment, Sky will charge us a fee!! As it happens, I have been in touch with the engineer from Friday who's been texting me on Friday as noone was at home, and he's just told me that Sky are lying! That openreach engineers do work on Saturdays! He himself was working today! Sky are a DISGRACE and I'm switching straight after Wednesday. That guy on the phone was a real waste of space. They should be ashamed."
Rich,1,1,"I have been trying to contact sky customer service for a week with no avail. Nobody available to talk on the phone and anytime I try to resolve something on their website it tells me that they are experiencing technical difficulties. I was given the option to help speed up my internet connection. Couldn't even get past the first step in testing the connection. Says that it usually takes two minutes -  I waited 30 minutes and still no completion. Absolutely shocking stuff in this day and age to be only receiving 22 mb/s internet speed. Will be terminating contract as soon ASAP. Poor customer service, awful internet. I WOULD NOT recommend that anybody uses their services."
Wendy,6,1,"Dreadful service, that I'm now stuck with for the next 16-7 months.I am paying for a Sky booster at £5/pcm but still have not received this, it was not provided at time of installation.Impossible to contact sky, unless you state you want to cancel a service and even then you sit on a phone for hours on end.  Otherwise every time you phone you, you get an automated message to say they'll send you a text to a link to help - which just takes you to a general help page which is useless.When I ordered Sky, they sent messages telling me there was a line, there wasn't a line, they cancelled the order and I had to re-order.  I should have realised then just how useless they were.  Now I have to suffer the remainder of an 18month contract.I also ordered Sky TV, but the box is not where we wanted it to be, as the engineer said it had to go on the other side of the house, but by then there was no option to cancel.  The wire for the installation is by the floor, yet the TV is on the wall, so now we have a trailing wire down the wall, so we've just unplugged it, but will still have to pay for Sky TV for the next 18 months even though we won't be using it.  Why don't they ask you pertinent questions such as this at the time of placing your order?Absolutely dreadful supplier."
Aishah Rani,1,1,"I ordered an iPhone 12 pro Max the night it had come out and been told it was coming on the 13th November but I didn’t receive an tacking email, my phone still hasn’t been delivered but my brother had ordered the phone two days after me he got his the day they had told him. I would never recommend sky to anyone because of their terrible customer service."
M Harris,5,5,"Fantastic customer service!! I have been with Sky for several years and never had any issues. My recent upgrade to Sky Q was seamless. The Customer Service Advisor, Emine was brilliant, as was the engineer, James who was meticulous in adhering to COVID health and safety procedures and was really polite and explained things clearly. Thank you both!!"
MR G0DL1KE,3,1,Heap of dog **** when the Internet actually works its terrible its down most of the time just terrible
Gabriel De Souza,1,1,"Worst broadband ever! And so the tv service. I have never experienced such a bad internet connection & Tv service since I signed up for sky. Poor/lost connection constantly and always losing signal on the tv as well. Please do yourself a favour and stay away from Sky, their customers service is not helpful at all and super rude over the phone. They will charge you for literally everything as well. I don’t even care that I had to pay to break the contract earlier I am just relieved I not longer have to deal with them no more."
Sam Jones,2,1,"By a mile the worst WiFi I have ever ever had. Takes upto 10 minutes to reboot and work again and is always crashing l. I will never ever use Sky again! By far the worst Broadband ever. Had to get there team out 3 times to look at our box, and it is still absolutely dreadful"
John Barfield,1,1,"Absolutely appalling service!! My internet went down nearly 2 weeks ago, I was advised that the fibre port was broke in the cable box and openreach couldn’t fix it for a months time. I work from home and I have had to try to connect my computer and work phone to my 4G which is not ideal at all. Called up 6 times within the past week because sky was meant to be trying to set up a temporary standard line so I can work, 5 times I was promised a call back, once even by their line manager and not once did I get a call back. One time I called and was lied to by one of the members of staff to say that openreach had responded and that a line would be set up in 48hours and that he would follow up and make sure it was done. I didn’t get a call so I had to call them, after over 30 mins of being on hold finally got through to someone and was told that open reach hadn’t actually responded and that I was misinformed by her colleague. Asked to speak to a manger named Dan who assured me again they would escalate this but it would take a further 48 hours and was promised a call back by 12pm after the 48hours was up. Surprise surprise no call, tried to call and this time was on the phone for a over an hour trying to get through to someone finally got through who put me on hold while they contacted open reach and then got cut off. She did call me back and did try to help but had advised openreach is escalating and promised me a call back on Monday Absolute joke, completely disgusted we are in a lock down and most people are having to work from home. Would never recommend Sky they just don’t care about customer service or the services they provide"
JCK,6,1,"Essentially lied and misdirected trying to tell me I had to speak to someone to prevent my contract ending otherwise it would auto renewed.  Tried to give me the run around for weeks until I lost patience and threatened formal action.  Charged me £100. with no warning for not returning the QBox during lock down (?!).   Prevented me from paying off my mobile handset (presumably to prevent me moving to another supplier).   Can never ever be reached - like ever !  I utterly despise these ar*&sh!!es   not worth the hassle, never again to darken my doorway!"
David Artingstall,3,1,Shocking customer service. Worst I've ever known. Been trying to arrange  a difficult access team to upgrade to Sky Q. Wasted hours. Couldn't communicate on line and phone calls I got passed from pillar to post. Even registering a complaint didn't improve service.
Emma Keeney,1,1,"Very bad service , we decided to swap back to sky from Vodafone broadband and tv. The guy put in the broadband and I asked about the TV he said sky would send a technician. My husband gave sky a buzz and they said they would have someone with us in 9 days. So we now have no tv. Terrible terrible service if you are thinking of going with check this issue with them .we not not expecting this and are extremely disappointed."
Paul Adamson,2,1,"Since COMCAST takeover, Sky News has become totally unwatchable.  Burley and Boulton are actually nasty and totally biased. After 25 years, you've lost my custom.  Cancelled my £60pcm package earlier today and won't be coming back.  Oh and persuaded another in my office to do the same."
NSHU KHAN,2,1,broadband is not working in our area Banbury. Ivatt Walk. Worst Service of Sky Broadband.AHMED
Alex,4,1,"Sky service is a total joke!!! I waited 2 weeks for a technician to connect Sky Box into my flat. On the day schedule, no one showed up neither contacted me to cancel. I called Sky and they rescheduled the installation into 2 more weeks. No respect for their customers and our mental health. I disconnected my previous service believing on them. Now Sky is asking me to be 2 weeks without tv in the middle of the lockdown. Ridiculous!!! I don’t recommend Sky to anyone."
onyourside,2,1,Despite having been with SKY for over 17 years it is incredible how they do not value your loyalty. I have just been told my monthly cost is about to go  up by 12% - coming out of a recession and in wave 2 of the pandemic!! I pay £940 a year for my package and was offered a reduction of £0.50p a month.The SKY VIP program is a complete farce as you end up in a raffle for the events/ offers with no assurance you will get anything.The front of house team are shackled by what they can do and the Cancellation Team do not care whether you stay or go.It is time to reconsider SKY and go for someone else.It is also about time senior management took all the negative reviews seriously. It is clear that customer satisfaction plays no part in their remuneration....easy street
Mrs . Wright,5,1,"After 20 years of being a Sky loyal customer I decided to cancel the subscription  . My husband had become ill and couldn’t work so  I couldn’t afford the payments anymore.After several tries I couldn’t get through by phone so emailed customer services asking them to cancel the subscription. But they still continued take payment, so I cancelled the DD Then was hounded for the last months payment £116 despite explaining and forwarding the emails to their customer services and explaining our hardship , husband ill and both  out of work and we wouldn’t of owed a month if they’d cancelled when first requested? I thought the debt  had been removed ? After correspondence telling me my email, phone number had been removed This was 16 months ago and they have now sold the debt on to a debt recovery  agency“Lowell” be warned they won’t work with you it’s now even more money. They are Merciless? And customer service non existent unles you buying more!"
Felix Scull,2,1,I have been billed £33 every month for 24 months. This was missold to me and I haven't lived in the property ever.£800 which I very much need gone and refusal of refund. Should be in jail. Lowlifes.
Ros Jackson,7,1,A complete joke for a communication company can't call online forms for complaints won't submit.   They don't have an issue taking payment for a service they are not providing.  I have been having issues for months with internet connection problems and no way to contact them
Catherine Victor,4,1,"I have just come off the phone to George, who is a manager at Sky. I have been a customer of Sky for 12 years paying them over £100 per month. I liked Sky and always had a good rapport with them until today. I moved my mobiles, my broadband along with my tv all to Sky.  I am moving house and then was supposed to have an engineer call today to install my new broadband between 12 and 5.00 (that is what I was informed when making the appointment) I drive 60 miles to be there for 12 waited until 5 and no one turned up. Then I get a text when I got back home engineer called at 5.10 and no one in the house. Called Sky they would not do anything about it and now I have to wait until the 24th for another engineer. This is how they treat VIP customers, God help the rest of you."
James Shaw,1,1,"Complete joke. We’ve been without internet for three weeks, and throughout that period have been consistently lied to by Sky. Absolutely appalling customer service. Will 100% avoid in the future."
tim brown,1,1,Ordered something from sky box office - but cancelled it ( well in time and in accordance with their terms and conditions ). They charged me anyway!!! Three hours on the phone during which time I was given 2 false email addresses!!! Still not got my money back. DO NOT TRUST SKY
ricky davies,6,5,"I was recently with virgin media who’s customer service is non existent. I left them due to this. I switched my internet over to BT as they were offering 1GB speeds and sky could only offer 70mb. The sky tv I have is years ahead of any competitors right now. It’s soo fast compared to the others. The SD streams at 720p when the competitors are still 460p. The guide, menus and some content is full 4k where as the HD is 1080p. My engineer was very helpful arriving on time and my customer service experience thus far has been superb. I do not agree with the political approach sky is taking but the quality of the tv is by far the best."
Ellie,3,1,"Absolutely SHOCKING service from Sky. Speaking to someone other then a robot is near on IMPOSSIBLE and has made the whole process horrendous. First off took me near on 2 hours to get through to a human, when I did they told me my broadband was cancelled (I never cancelled it!) and I now have to wait another week to get internet. I am then meant to be having my SKY Q box setup today and the engineer has not turned up nor have I had any comms about where he is. I am trying to get through to a human to chase this up and I cannot. I just get re-directed to their website which doesn't help. Absolute shambles!!!!!!"
JoeEastern,3,1,"I recently cancelled my sky subscription as they kept on increasing the price. They made various offers etc, as they always do to keep my custom for less money, but I refused.The crazy thing is, in the first year of my subscription, I received a letter from them stating that if the Sky Q box broke, I would have to pay to replace it as it belongs to me and not them. I threw the letter away not thinking any more of it.After my subscription ended they demanded I sent the box back to them as it belongs to them! They said if I didn't they would charge me for it.I phoned them and they denied sending me any letter stating the box was mine.I sent the box back anyway as I didn't want it, but what a nasty money grabbing tactic.If I had kept the letter I would have kept the box out of principle and made them take me to court etc. then produced the letter.So basically...""If it's broken it's yours and you have to pay us for another one! If it's working - we want it back as we couldn't have you using it in some way without giving us money!""Be wary of this company's underhand methods to get money from you."
Lu,6,1,"Sky have  stolen £190 from our account and after numerous calls each week to have it refunded as its their error. (half the calls directed me to  Indian call centres that can't deal with your problem and make promises that don't happen)They have gave us credit on our account but we want our money refunded into our account. Apparently its too large amount to be refunded, therefore sky holds our money in their account for the next 6 months. Again numerous calls to the complaint department and they say they can't refund us but will pass it onto the accounts department.Absolutely aggressive sales techniques by the Sky company, they should be investigated.(TIPS IF YOU NEED TO GET HOLD OF SKY, DO NOT USE THEIR FREE NUMBERS AS THIS DIRECTS YOU TO THEIR INDIAN CALL CENTRES THAT GENERALLY CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT PLUSPRESS THE MAKE A CHANGE OR CANCEL YOUR SKY ACCOUNT ON THE AUTOMATED PHONECALL, TO DIRECT YOU TO A CUSTOMER ADVISOR, THIS WILL GET YOU AN UK CALL CENTRE AND GENERALLY A FASTER RESPONSE TO A BETTER SALES TEAM)"
Dom meffe,6,1,"Sky broadband are the worst broadband out there! Don’t bother wasting your money, broadband is down pretty much every day at some point. Customer service is a absolute joke, I’m due to move house next month. I sure won’t be taking this broadband with me!"
Jacob Perebere,1,1,"I wouldn’t recommend sky to anyone,I’ve been without internet for 6 weeks now,I’m an agent for COVID-19 test and absolutely struggling to place my driver’s,been made a lot of promises but still nothing,very poor service,but still taking payments from my account."
MRS T COOPER,3,5,"Sky have gone above and beyond to get broadband connected to my new build property. I am in the shielding vulnerable group and having internet access is vital for communication with my oncologist at the Royal Marsden 118 miles from home, especially during these difficult Covid times. Although it has taken a long time to get connected with many hurdles tojump, they have contacted me at least 3 times a week with updates and also arranged temporary internet access. Sky team have been informative, kind and friendly. Both  Fiona and Julie both based in Scotland have been wonderful. I received a hamper when it was my birthday, I was not well at the time and it really lifted my spirits. My dog got sick and I nearly lost him, he too received a hamper. Thank you Sky team, my super fast broadband is amazing, well worth the wait and both my dog and I are well at the moment. One very happy Sky customer"
Richard,22,1,"Had Sky for many years but this year with covid reduced my bill from £70+ a month to £29 a month .. what did they do deleted all my recordings because they were HD recordings I had in fact paid for while my bill was in the 70's ... what fkn right do you have to delete something already paid for ? AVOID Sky like the plague , they scam and cheat all customers to suit their needs !! a Disgrace !!"
Adrian Evans,1,1,"I contacted sky yesterday asking to upgrade my phone by paying off the balance of £804 and then pre ordering the iPhone 12 pro max ! The guy on the phone said yes that is fine so I agreed for call back next day after I’ve moved some money around to pay it . The next day I get phone call at 4pm he was so polite asked for money to be paid an he will get phone ordered , so I gave him the bank details to pay phone once that was complete he asked what the phone was I wanted again an looked it up then said option button was not highlighted so he said il call you back about 6 if it’s sorted or i will call you back at 10 am tomorrow . So it got till half 6 an no phone call an I started to feel something ain’t right so I called sky an basically they said he had no right saying that he could do an upgrade an it’s to late now you have paid the money so after back an forth arguing she said what I can do is your other recent purchase was an iPhone 11 so il put it through as a phone swap but you just won’t give us back iPhone 11 so I said ok if that get s me the phone fine ! Next min she saying we got to do a new credit check even though it’s supposed to be an iPhone swap after a lot of excuses saying system is freezing credit check comes back as decline so I say fine just give me £804 pound back but she says no sorry I can’t you paid it but then agrees to go through complaint system which is now gonna take 48 hours . So moral of story don’t trust there upgrade policy they just take your money"
Alexandra  Roman,4,1,"Not even a star! If this is the sky Internet broadband it is absolutely rubbish! I am extremely disappointed i signed a 2 year contract and it's not providing the Internet speed promised, please DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Customer service very very very unprepared and not at all helpful so please save yourselves from the distress of signing with Sky"
Ricci white,3,1,"Took out SkyQ package inc broadband. Circa £60 per month. engineers came out who decided they couldn't fit the skyQ adaptor on the dish (despite me advising they may need the sky height reach team to install). 5 months later, nothing back from sky - i called to cancel as they hadn't installed skyQ and (therefore unable to use services). I was advised i had committed to a contract and they would take me to court if i didn't pay. Intimidated in to paying £1440 in subscription fees to sky for a service i couldn't use. When i tried to complain, i was met with aggression, misleading information and distraction techniques through the advisors. I'm currently in the process of seeking a resolution through the financial ombudsman to resolve. Issue has been going on for 2 years - got in touch with sky today and their resolution is ""We can cancel your contract now"" well yeah, that's because its been going on for 2 years. in terms of the actual service they provide - TV, ok although nothing you can't get from the internet/amazon/netflix etc. broadband is terrible, keeps dropping out and slow upload/download speeds. unable to play ps4 online with it. if you have ANY OTHER CHOICE use them not sky.A real shame i can't give them 0 starts!"
Steve Norton,2,4,"Connection was dropping so worked through online troubleshooting and help, eventually ended up talking to a human (though this was tricky).They booked engineer slot with Openreach 3 times, who discovered that significant works needed to be done.Works now complete and my speed is up by 20mbps. Sky and Openreach were helpful, and I'm happy even though it's taken 3 weeks to resolve."
JM,1,1,Worst Wifi ever constantly drops out and lose connection on my gaming console even with an Ethernet cable plugged in.Loses connection about 8 times a day so I have to reset the modem just to get it to work again.I have changed modem and Ethernet cables still same problems and to try and call them is a joke.Worst company ever
John Grogan,4,1,Wish I had read these reviews before changing. On the phone (2 phones) for over 2 hours and running!!!!!!!
Janice,1,1,"I have not had broadband for over a month!!!!!With working from home, Sky DO NOT care about their customers and they do not care that we are unable to work from home because my internet does not work even after numous calls, emails, messages and engineer visits. The advisers are rude and have no knowledge as they keep asking if i can try on another phone, we have tried their tests on 4 different phones and the advisers said it is all 4 phones are the issue not their internet. I am sick of this company and will continue to fight them until 1. I have received the services I pay for2. I receive a refund for the month without internet 3. A written apology.We are having to use our mobile hotspots to work, which is unacceptable."
Ed Pethick,5,1,"Phoned sky 4weeks before home move.They admit to messing up the order one week before hand, it'll be three days late. No biggie. A week after that, still no Internet. Phone up, they're very sorry it'll be sorted in 48 hrs.We're now two weeks later and STILL NO INTERNET. New install date in a further week. The continued incompetence is utterly staggering."
Janine Padmore,11,1,I was told that I did not need to return the sky box as I had it changed . Now they are saying they are going to charge me . I have been trying to speak to someone but unsuccessful . I am going to stop paying SKY and that is how someone will get in contact with me . Very bad customer service
Jodie,2,1,"I had to return my Sky Q box just before the pandemic, country was in lock-down for 6 months. I had an email when the restrictions started to ease advising I would be charged £100 if the box were not returned. The box was returned the 28/09/20. My next bill was due to be taken on the 28/10/20, which is was with the £100 bill attached. I called on the 28/10/20 to advise I wanted my refund as I sent the box back a month ago, to then be told I would get my £100 refund within 72 hours, I was fine with this. On the 02/11/20 I still had no refund, when I called, I was told that it would be taken off my next bill, which I was not advised on the first call. I told the adviser I wanted to make a complaint as I was not happy with the misinformation and waiting around for money that should not have been taken in the first place. The adviser was not empathetic to my situation at all. He told me he would process the refund which will take 3-5 days to be processed. I called back on the 05/11/20 and spoke to Jessica. I was advised that the refund was only started on the 02/11/20, after I made a complaint, and it would take up to 5 days to be processed into my account, which will be Monday the 9th November at the latest. Monday the 9th of November, I received an email stating ‘We wanted to let you know that we’ll be refunding you £100. Your refund will appear on your next bill.’Again, no refund in my bank. On the 09/11/20 Called sky again and spoke to Jim. Was told that it was only processed on the 06/11/20 08.06pm. Was told there was absolutely no way I could get the refund today. Asked if I could speak to a manager, and Jim advised the managers are no longer taking calls to deal with customer complaints, and there was no way he could help. I asked to be passed through to the cancellations department, had to wait another 30 minutes for call to be answered. Finally got through to Sam at the cancellations department, wanted to cancel due to the terrible service I’ve received, which then I was told they would charge me £59 to cancel! So, after all this bad customer service I’d received, they want to charge me an extra £59! After putting me on hold and speaking to his supervisor, I was told I was now exempt from getting charged the £59. He asked which provider I was going to, and I advised plus net. Sam then advised if I go with Plus net, they use the same line, so if I were to call them and advise I am currently with Sky, they will swap lines. I asked Sam will this still mean that I will NOT be charged cancellation, he advised I WILL NOT be charged. Sam advised that there was an issue with the post at the time I send the box back, to which I replied, this was not my fault. Sam also advised the reason I was getting misinformation is because their system is hard to read, and they need to refresh to get the latest information. This is also not my fault. I have asked my bank to put through an indemnity claim, and I have the refund back in my account immediately. I am very surprised that your customer service team have not advised me to do to this at an earlier stage, given the circumstances. I had no choice but to do this as I have small children I need to feed with this money. Sky’s customer service has been the worst I have ever received from a company and I can confidently say that I will never be returning."
Kelly Edwards,1,1,Do not trust Sky. They randomly took £130 out of my account for a box that I already had sent back. I’ve not been with Sky for a year now but used my bank details to take it. Customer Service said it will be in my account by Monday. Still not in my account . Called back to be then told it would be in my account within 3-5 working days. How come they can easily take my money but so hard to get it back
John,4,1,I would have selected Zero stars but not an option. Broadband not working for 2 months. Sky making no attempts to rectify the situation
Eileen,13,5,We had a problem with our new install of Sky boxes which has been kindly sorted out above and beyond our expectations on a Sunday evening during lockdown by a lovely guy called Ryan and it’s all sorted and our new Sky Q mini boxes will be fitted this week.  Thank you Ryan 👍 Andy in Norfolk
Bridget Walsh,3,1,Very bad service cut me off on a sunday when it was my 2 year old boys birthday.. they sed i owe 180euro when my package is for 84e they wouldnt wait til da monday morning so i could pay it even doh i didnt owe dat much. Sky is always puttin my bill up cos they no i be lost for tv wit my 2 boys... robbing c-nts wont ever forget dis one over routing my boys 2nd birthday with no tv for him or his brother nd aspecially when were in lockdown to make if worst yer no frontline workers ye bad people....
Peter Kay,2,1,"Absolutely terrible service.Sky is quick enough to hassle you about upgrades to your package, but as soon as you want to downgrade, trying to make contact is a nightmare, non existant.I managed to make contact through facebook, but they told me someone would be in touch about my account, 3 days has passed now and still no contact.Such terrible way to treat customers, pure lack of care.Looks like Ill cancell everything.Good riddance"
Looker,3,1,"Slow, and sometimes network can fail. Does not notify you when broadband contract is over, and it continues to take money"
Sarah Elizabeth Bell,1,1,Remember the people working for you work off commission. That’s all I’ll say. I asked for sky tv and broadband. I have broadband and no sky tv which was not made clear to me and I would have chose differently if I had been told
john Coady,17,1,"Oh my god has sky finally woke up and smelled the coffee beans,,,, sky tv, broadband, sports, cinema all for 70 euro a month black friday deal,,,, well it should be black Friday every year,,,, now all they need to do is add the kids pack,, netflix and there sucking diesel and they will have thousands of customers,,,, 😁,,, but let's face it that will never happen,,, 😜 I'll stick to my freeview much much better and no headaches😊😊😊😊😊"
Kieron Walls,1,1,Customer support is the worst couldn't resolve our issue we've had for the past 3 month where our WiFi would cut off then not come back on for a week they just would not resolve the issue I feel sorry for most of the workers who work for their service absolutely horrendous. Switching to bt seeming as their support seems to be doing a better job good reviews from our relatives and friends.
Bernie Canada,7,1,"Again and again and again....watching Soccer and every other 20-30 secs  , I get interruptions, blurry pics etc. And for that service they get the money? Why?"
Dylan Matthews,1,1,"Horrendous, when we call to complain or ask for them to solve there sh*te WiFi problem, they suggest we spend more money instead of trying to help. Scamming b@st@rds need shooting. Cannot believe that they get away with not providing a service and ripping people off. Pirates the lot of them."
Charley Moulding,4,5,"Just off the phone to sky customer service and had the pleasure of speaking with Mohamed Zeedan. He was an absolute delight to speak with. Changing my name and gender and so understanding and supportive, what an absolute credit to your company, a champion for diversity and inclusion. Please make sure that Mohamed is given the credit he deserves and is congratulated on his awesome customer service skills. We could all learn something from people like this !! 💜"
GH,2,1,"After being a customer of sky TV for 10 years decided to cancel as 1. Broadband is horrendously slow and not worth the money. 2. Been watching Netflix abd Disney +. Managed to get it cancelled after waiting forever to speak to a person. Informed final bill would be for 3 days use. It was for the TV service but they charged me a whole month of broadband despite not having access go the service. When i finally got through to call centre land all he could say was it would take 45 days for a refund, no apology, no explanation. Cheers Sky, great way to treat your customers. Will not be back, ever."
Partytime,2,1,"If I could give no * I wouldDo not upgrade to Sky's q box if you have Freeview or Freesat in your house as it does not feed the required signal to other rooms, you will have to get multi room at a cost of 19 per month, a con!!!!The hi-brid LNB does NOT SEND THE NECESSARY SIGNAL TO OTHER ROOMS FOR FREESAT TO WORK!!"
Alex Glover,14,1,I’ve been a sky customer for many years. With a great credit rating. But for some reason sky failed my credit check. Pretty insulting to be honest. Save your time and go elsewhere. Horrible service
Sean Hughes,1,2,"""Pre ordered"" iPhone 12 pro and had a email saying from 2nd November thinking it would probably arrive on that day but no it's been delayed till 21st of November which is a bit of a joke! Then sky send a 10 pound voucher for movies  I'd expect them to pay for first month of the phone! We should never have to wait nearly a month for a pre ordered phone it's Bad customer service to be honest and its obvious there's going to be a high demand it's only just come out so sky should of Brought more in then they would of been more available on the 2nd November!"
Craig,1,1,"Cancelled my sky tv and sky broadband a few months ago. Had an email saying I still owed money for sky tv after they said they had cancelled both, end up having to pay the bill. Heartless thieving scandalous company. Will never be going back and will not be recommending to anyone whatsoever."
Kelly Yasmine,15,5,Every time I get through I'm put on straight away even when they say 30 minutes wait. Must be for members. I spoke to a lovely lady in Fife and I'm in Brighton. We were talking about the lockdown. I paid my phone bill has I was behind. Its all good now thanks to viki in Fife with sky. Com
Barbara Wilding,6,5,"Problems resolved, very helpful on telephone. Open reach were really good this time doing a thorough job to find fault and didn’t have to wait too long for them to come.Sky engineers were also very good"
Ben,4,1,Absolutely disgusting service! Promised 6-7 phone calls that were never given. My complaint is 5 months ongoing. Over 12-13 hours spent on the phone speaking to people who don’t care nor want to help. Offered measly compensation to cover my time and distress leading me to seek help from CICAS.
Matt Greenwood,1,1,"Shame I can’t give 0 stars. Conned us into ‘upgrading’ to Sky Q and it’s absolutely awful. Everything about it is bad, even the cheap remote. Hate it, don’t make the mistake of downgrading to Sky Q!"
MICHAEL RAMSDEN,2,1,Incapable of giving good customer service
aroG,3,1,Ordered a Mobile from Sky and my credit check went thru and after placing my order they have cancelled my order & now its out of stock and they can't give me a reason why they have cancelled me Wonder?
Shubi Mohan,6,1,"Your customer services is the worst!!! We got new broadband from you and you sent letters and emails about setting it up. You also said an engineer will be coming to set up the broadband, we waited weeks and weeks but no engineer. We chased on phone calls but you kept giving us delayed dates. When we set up the box ourselves, everything seemed to be connected but still not working properly. Now when we spoke on the phone you said that our broadband won’t even be activated until an engineer comes! And said that we were still using Talk-Talk broadband. The internet is so weak and goes whenever the home phone line rings. So why mislead us and send us various forms of communication on how to set up in the first place?! And why are you not sending engineers on time for installation?! And it’s so hard to get through to your customer services to actually speak to someone! When you finally get through, you don’t even get an apology or they don’t even try to fix ir. Disgusting customer service and an even more disgusting company. Do not trust Sky! (This is coming from a customer who has had Sky tv for years and years but not broadband and has had Talk talk, BT as internet providers previously). Good luck to their customer services team who has so many complaints to deal with it. I wouldn’t be surprised if this company comes down during Covid-19! Very very sad, now we've had to cancel and move on to another company. British companies need to learn to improve their customer service if they want to survive."
Lauren Baldwin,8,1,"I recently moved into a new build property so I am aware there is a slight delay in installing broadband. However due to me working from home I began arranging for my broadband to be installed a week before my move in date.Virgin said there would be a 6-8 week wait to install the cable whereas sky informed me it would be 2 weeks.It has been passed that date and i am no where near closer to getting an update on when I will getting broadband. I am working from home and using my mobiles data to get me by which is UNACCEPTABLE. Sky cannot give me an update as all they say is 'Waiting for Openreach'Get your arses out from each others backsides and phone to Openreach to prioritise getting broadband to the house. At this rate I could have gone with Virgin for much faster internet, same price and quite frankly up with the times in technologySORT IT OUT"
kyle hickman,1,1,"I had Sky Tv and broadband booked in for Thursday 29th October. Open Reach we’re unable to complete their work because they didn’t have plastic ladders!! And now I’m having to wait a further two weeks to get broadband installed at my new house!! Additionally, Sky tv successfully installed last Thursday BUT I was cut off from watching Sky Sports the following morning!!! (Friday 30th) it’s been 7 days and I’m still unable to watch Sky Sports!!!! I have called and spoke to 8 different representatives and NONE OF THEM can explain why I am unable to watch something I am paying for! No one at sky has even made an effort to contact me or even apologise about there awful service. I haven’t even been offered anything in return!!! I have had to call them during my days off!!! Again, I have just put the phone down on another representative because they don’t know what the problem is! Once again; I’m sat here with no TV or WiFi during a lockdown!!!! Well done Sky!! You’re absolutely shocking!!!!!"
Paul B.,2,1,"Terrible service. You can’t contact them online so I wrote to them by snail mail 4 times to say our TV is not working. For a month now. Internet is beyond slow and intermittent at best. They got back the first time, gave us a new modem - no improvement. I wrote three more letters. The last was to cancel! Then they replied. The chap on the phone was fine. Not his fault his employer has the worst after sales service I have ever experienced. Avoid!!"
Anthony Miller,13,1,"I ran a speed test on my broadband and was informed online that I needed to speak to a tech person to get it sorted. I am getting nowhere near the speeds that I am guaranteed and paying for. Unfortunately I can never get through to speak to a human being. And every time I try to call it costs me a small fortune just hanging on the phone and never getting through, shocking.Also the sky website is awful, half the pages do not load. I have been a loyal sky customer but I am thinking seriously of moving to virgin or BT. For what my monthly bill is I expect better service. No option to send a simple email and chat service is always busy, Impossible to get through to speak to someone. User friendly customer services is non existent."
Consumer,3,5,Just spoken with a representative of Sky called Kaitlan.I was going to close my Sky tv account as it was getting too expensive. The lady was able to give me an offer which meant that I was able to stay with Sky.Sky went above and beyond what I expected and I am happy to remain one of their customers/
Bart,6,2,"The services are good - nice tv box (even though extra q boxes sometimes disconnect), new reach-everywhere router is fantastic. Customer service used to be excellent before covid, but it took them months to get back to answering phone calls (except sales).My cancellation experience was awful. Moving to a new place they were unable to provide fast broadband and I have the right to cancel if that's the case, which was not proactively explained to me. No one can work from home with 5Mb internet connection these days. The tv cancellation was worse yet - they were unable to use the current sockets (or the engineers can’t be bothered - it’s easier to drill a hole - except I can not do that).I still periodically receive odd emails with some made-up charges even though I paid so many time. I feel if I had to do it again, I’d just wait for one final bill from a collection agency rather than try to negotiate with sky. They have no long term vision in their customer service, unfortunately."
Emanuel galea,3,5,I have seen a lot of bad reviews here but I have had a fantastic experience. I switched from virgin nightmare to sky a week ago and have been pleasantly surprised by the great customer service and the great service of there installation team. Well done sky and thank you 👍
Andrew Gregory,2,1,"My mother is severely disabled and i pay her bill via giro bank at the postoffice, she has been a loyal customer for years now, last month i'm giessing i must have been a little late with the payment ie a day or two due to the mail in our area cf40 being heavily disrupted. They have suspended her account saying there is £10 owing on the account. Absolutely shocking and disgraceful. With paying by girobank they could add it to next months bill as a late payment charge but no on this occasion they just suspended the account, thankyou so much for your support sky with the elderly and disabled. A Gregory."
Js,4,1,
Steve Mccabe,11,1,"This company is a disgrace After paying over the top for my monthly package for 4 years ( my fault I accept )  as soon as you go to leave they give you better at half the price you were payingTakes day off work because they wont give any idea of time Engineer turns up Says hes not qualified enough ,its only an upgrade so I lose a days money They rebook stating 2 man job I wait from 8am until 3.30 PM another days money lostEngineer turns up on his own I'm not qualified to do it so another day lost They do not care just want to sell all the time A disgrace"
Pip,50,5,"I've been a Sky TV customer for over 14 years but my £36 per month bill was getting a bit hard to justify and I needed to cut costs. I went on live chat and explained. I know their staff are instructed to upsell, but I was out of contract and knew what sort of price I wanted to pay, and I was perfectly okay with getting rid of Sky altogether if I couldn't get a deal. I'd recently seen an offer for new customers which was basically my package, but with Netflix included, all for £25 a month. I wasn't happy being a long standing customer yet paying £11 more, for less. Anyway, the sky rep tried to offer me different deals and packages but I just told him straight, that I wanted to be paying half what I was currently paying, if not, I'd have to leave completely. The guy was brilliant. To cut a long story short, I've kept my package as I was happy with that, but now I've got access to other stuff, and box sets, all for £18 a month! I've taken out another 18 month contract, but I'm happy with that and will be sticking with Sky for the foreseeable :)"
S Shah,1,1,
anthony kytzia,7,1,"Have been a customer for over 20 years. I pay over £150 per month for broadband, telephone and tv. My box has packed up and simply put, Sky could not give a fk. The digital support is a complete joke. I have bought a Freesat box Manhattan SX which gives me 183 channels free of charge, can highly recommend this at £ 50 no subscription, compared to what you pay Sky. Sky have lost the plot on customer support. Do not subscribe as you will not be supported."
Sufian Yusuf,1,1,"Absolutely embarrassing wifi, bought the sky boost and no it is not worth it, the only word that comes into existence with sky is lag. Lag lag LAG . That is all I have to say, by far the worst broadband I have ever had, and I have ever given my children. I recommend choosing another company like virgin media or BT. Appalling!"
Phoebe,11,2,The price for broadband is okay but the signal is absolutely abysmal. don’t count on streaming or watching online media like Netflix or Amazon because you’ll die of old age before it loads. It forever disconnects as well. Only to be told by a sky advisor that the signal is good in my area. What a joke. Plus the price increases every couple of months are just criminal.
Gabbo,6,1,We've reverted to what can only be described as the equivalent of Sky's 'standard variable rate'. Following paying without failure our c.£23 a month for 18 months - we now pay £41.99 for exactly the same product. Can I get through to discuss this with Sky on the phone - no. Can I get through on the chat function online - no. Can I manage my account online for the purposes of either upgrading or getting a better deal - no. Can I cancel my account online - no. So we're stuck paying c.180% more for exactly the same product. Completely unacceptable. Sky product developers and customer experience colleagues need to ask themselves the question - would I be comfortable in treating a friend or family member like this? Could I justify the price differential for a loyal customer? Answers on a postcard.
Tanya Vittorio,12,1,As soon as I am out of contract I will be saying goodbye to Sky. What a shocking service. Not able to speak to anyone. No broadband connection which I need to do my job. They say they are only taking calls from vulnerable people... I doubt they can get through either. Vulnerable or not all customers should be able to access a good level of service. COVID-19 is no excuse either. Multi million pound business. Get your employees working from home so there are more customer care advisors to assist your customers. You are going to lose valuable customers.
Rebecca Mitchell,5,1,"Where do I start? Absolutely shocking that, despite trying online help guides via their website, it’s impossible to get through to sky customer services. Their sky buddy app is beyond abysmal. It’s not operating properly and all my devices are paused with no way of me unblocking despite reinstalling the app. Then to finally find a phone number, persist through an irritating options menu only to be told they will text me with a link to “useful online guides” is enough to make me want to throw their rubbish WiFi router in the bin. In the past, telling the robot that you want to cancel your contract was the only way to speak to a human being. Sadly not any more, a further foray into their ridiculous options menu bore no fruit, simply telling me the department is closed and leaving me with a curt cut-off tone. Hopeless. And don’t get me started on the rubbish internet speeds. Really disappointed I ever moved away from BT. Sadly tied into a contract now and have no way to try to seek help from Sky! Must try harder, Sky."
Anonymouse,3,1,"Deary me! After 2 failed visits from 2 different engineers and numerous phone calls to ""customer services"" over the past week I find myself in the curious position of having to order the fitting for a satellite dish AND show Engineer 3 how to use it. Engineer 2 recommended that I find a YouTube video to show them. Engineer 1 practically ran for the hills when I explained that they would need to use a particular fixing.Admittedly, I have just moved to a new build steel frame modular home with external insulation that requires certain types of fitting, which might be unfamiliar. However, I have contacted Sky numerous times before and after appointments to explain exactly what is needed and to let me know if this will cause problems. As I mentioned to Engineer 2, this may be the first time they have encountered this type of externally insulated home, but it is unlikely to be the last.The main issue appears to be communication between customer services and the engineers who appear on my doorstep totally clueless about the information I provided and without the part I have been advised they should to use to protect my home's external insulation. I even provided the phone number of the property developer so that they could ask directly what to use.I really hope someone at Sky pays attention to these reviews as phoning and using online messaging before and after each failed appointment appears ineffective and - as mentioned by other reviewers - searching for an email address is a futile and frustrating waste of time. The lack of an email address makes it impossible for me to provide links to the Swifix Satellite fitting plate (SWI/SP) the property developer recommends - or to the YouTube video it would help an engineer to view before they arrive. Luckily all wiring appears to be pre-installed, so it is just the dish that is the issue (according to Engineer 2 - Engineer 1 said he would still drill for this..... not convinced).I have another appointment scheduled for Friday - the fixing is due to be delivered tomorrow. All Sky now need to do is provide the engineer, a ladder, their tools (including a 16 mm drill bit, plus a standard tube cutter, hacksaw or pipe cutter), the dish with screws and wall plugs - plus some mastic to help seal the edges of drilled holes. Fingers crossed, but I am not holding my breath!When I have time and energy I may try phoning Sky again to find out if they are willing to cover the cost of the fitting - or provide some other compensation for wasting 2 half days of valuable annual leave on unfulfilled appointments (so far). And I am heartily tired of having to explain the same thing to multiple members of Sky - given they are a telecommunications company, it's past time they improved both internal and external communication. However, I do now know more about satellite installation than I thought I would ever need - and they say no knowledge is ever wasted.....I did consider giving an extra star for helpful information provided by Engineer 2 - however, the overall service and experience has been abysmal.NB this review is specifically for Sky TV - broadband installation did go ahead as scheduled, fortunately, so I am able to work and watch most channels through my smart TV or laptop.03/11/2020 update. I have just spent 15 minutes on hold before speaking to customer services. All they would do is put a note on file that I have the fixing. The team responsible for installations does not communicate directly with customers. I advised that if this 3rd appointment fails I will be cancelling my order, but was assured that it should go ahead and that the engineer will have the necessary drill bits.Engineer 3's visit was perhaps more frustrating than the previous 2 as I was told that I had been misinformed by customer services and the previous engineer, in that they would never install 3rd party equipment and so he would not fit a dish using the equipment I had bought. Almost 1.5 hours on the hone later I had cancelled my order for Sky tv, but unfortunately felt I could not cancel my broadband service with them as I need uninterrupted service for work. Sadly I am now tied into an 18 month broadband contract and unable to take advantage of package bundles from other providers during this time.Sky - make sure that both customer services and engineers tell customers the same thing, rather than fobbing them off and wasting their time and money. And also review your policy and training to include non-standard construction homes - or at least make it clear up front that you are not competent to provide a service to such homes."
Hiral Fletcher,6,1,Sucks.... Cheaters....absolutely rubbish customers services.  I am calling them everyday just to terminate my contract... but no luck... it's over 30 days now and I can't contact them and there is no online option to terminate the contract. My bill was £50 and not its £80.  No explanation is given.  They have done that 6 months ago from £50 to £120.It's a fraud and illegal... I am also going to seek consumer advice as I can't just deal with it anymore!
Mags  Fitz,3,1,"If I could give a minus score, I would. Why cant they be normal and just let you email the fault, understandable that the box may need to be restarted and fault can be fixed from home ....but if you can see a phone line dangling why should you have to wait 2 hours on the phonr to tell some1,,,,no wait,,,,its COVID,,, like it makes a difference"
Jaque Rodrigues-Day,2,1,"More than one month to get the broadband installed in my house, once installed worked for a day and never again, called on a Saturday, no one could handle the problem on the weekend, then again on Monday - after 1hour waiting on the call - the person doesn't know how to fix the problem and doesn't know what is wrong. Sky blames Siro that installed the broadband and Siro blame Sky for the internet issues. Horrible service, outrageous amount of time to get anything dealt with. Run away from Sky. It is not worth it."
Carl Connor,16,1,"The worst company ever. I seriously pitty the lot of you who have to turn up there on a Monday morning, or work from home! I'd rather live in the gutter than work for Sky"
Luke Marrin,2,1,"Honestly dog s**t they carry on saying they have fixed and sorted it but it  get worse every time, you can’t watch a YouTube video let alone Netflix on this bag of w*nk, if you are looking to buy sky ‘DO NOT’"
Simon King,1,1,"God awful customer service. Sky have to be one of the worst companies for service in the UK. Great at taking money. Awful at taking responsibility. Spoke to an advisor called 'loki'. Yes mate, and I'm Thor! Lies, fobbing off and everything is the customers fault (to quote Loki!) I have been suckered by their deals when you try to leave for too long. Now I will bin these crooks."
Brendan Codd,1,1,"What I can't understand is where are the national regulators to deal with this monstrosity of a company? They are obviously lying and cheating and exploiting their customers. There are laws against what they are doing yet no one seems to be enforcing them. Dare I suggest financial backhanders at play? Like the rest of you I was treated with contempt by sky who hooked me with free tv offer last Christmas, surprise,surprise I never received said tv. I left and they sent debt collectors after me yet as far as I'm concerned they owe me! The debt collectors have dropped the case and returned my file to sky accepting that sky are in the wrong. For those who can afford to,there is a moral duty to fight these thieves on behalf of the more vulnerable who are not in a position to do so. Take the legal route,challenge them,complain to every agency and politician you can. Sky's attitude to customers is a cancer that will spread to all multinationals if proven to be successful. Take the fight back to them.     Also a quick word to the regulators of this site. Have a look at the 5 star reviews you are allowing here, virtually all contain praise for a named sky employee. Take a guess at who's writing these reviews. They are skewing the real public perception of sky and should be thoroughly screened."
kevin m,1,1,This is one of the worst company's I've encountered  ....a disaster ....I would recommend to all to stay away from these gangsters....6 weeks in..and 6 weeks of problems...sky..take a run a jump for yourselfs
GaiaTime,2,1,"I have ""upgraded"" to sky super fast broadband about 3 month ago, my last 26 speed tests have returned an average of 16mbps, if thats ""minion proof"" then I'm a bit of a mug putting up with very slow internet speeds and no improvement via sky customer services? Bring back 14.4k dial-up on 486 PC's where I could at least do what I wanted :/. I would NOT recommend sky for their internet.*UPDATE* tested 3 runs this afternoon, 4.4, 4.7 & 4.8 Dload times and to enforce the absolutely awfully worse-than-poor ""service"" one test abandoned as it froze on 0.0mbps? Feel as if I've been ""scammed"" as i'm only a few month into a new contract? Call at my home Idris Elba and see for yourself? :O"
Maggie Gurney,7,1,"Sky box is temperamental, the remote is awful for forwarding and pausing- a bit of a lottery. Takes forever to reboot. I must find an alternative!"
Edma,1,2,"Who could believe SKY true the year gets there and there sneaky charges. You think ia a big company won't play such a dirty game. Broadband itself never got any problems,  but them sneaky charges spoils everything"
ZOHRA HBAIZ,1,1,It is one of the worst experiences with such a big company. I started my contract with them in February for internet and tv services. They never delivered on their end of the contract and they were taking big amounts of money from my accounts and when I ask for clarifications they were very threatening. I don't know how to solve  this problem. It's been very hard lately with everything going on!
Torran karle,1,1,I phoned as my service was restricted even though bill isnt due until 15th November next. Phoned up saying I need to make a part payment today or else they cant do anything I have £10 left to my name and said the system wont take that money but sometimes it does. The System is all code and data it can't just make its mind up whenever it wants to. The lady was rude and and her attitude was awful. I will be leaving my contract and going with somebody else!!! Avoid at all costs.
ZMarr ZTrio,1,1,"I have been dealing with this crowd about the same issue for 11 months now and it's still not resolved. Now they want to charge me another 35 euros for a router that never worked, and the engineer refused to take back when I tried to send it back despite their website telling customers that this was an option. I was passed around from Billy to jack from December to March gone. I Had to take several days annual leave off work only to have technicians not arrive, or tell me one thing and apparently the customer service another. I've spent over 20 hours on messenger this week trying to send them a receipt to show the useless router is gone back to them only to be told tonight that their messenger service is now closed again. They need to get it sorted. The fact that these people think messenger is a suitable way to conduct business is a an indication of their attitude to customers. Their customomer service is a disgrace. I'm complaining to consumer affairs and if they dare to charge me for that router I'll be at their doors in Santry."
Geoff Creak,7,1,"My 73 year old Dad has been messed around by these guys, called numerous times passed from pillow to post. Booked sky 18th Sept after being messed about with dates, now told instalment would be 17th December is that anyway to treat a pensioner who has to isolate with no tv. Zero compassion, Zero customer service 😔"
LUENA Renee,16,1,0 stars.a bunch of thieves.i have no box no password in 2 weeks they've taken £46.97 off me.tried ringing all sky numbers no avail.
customer,2,2,"Upgraded by Broadband package and throughout ensured that a new router was part of the deal, which they confirmed that it was.  Once I had accepted the deal and they had read my T&Cs they advised me that a router would not be sent out to me - no apology or acceptance that they had missold the deal.  I insisted that they include the router and they forwarded my call to another department where I held for a long time before giving up."
Mimi Woods,4,1,I have been attempting to alter my Sky package and have spent hours on the phone talking to different people and different departments .Have just been contacted to be told yet again that there is a problem with my order and to get in touch . IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. I am now tempted to leave SKY altogether and move to a different provider . I will look into this on Monday
De c,21,1,"I have been a Sky customer for over a decade.My Sky fibre was intermittent and every time the 18 months contracts came to an end the bill would rise, and service go down. This year yet again l discussed the service. All they would offer after 12 years was a booster on the fibre, which l had to pay extra for and another 18 months contract, with price increase. No other concessions for TV, phone part package. Just kept saying best they could do! Cancelled down fibre and moved. Waited for alternative TV viewing system and cancelled down Sky TV. Guess what after paying £27.00 for TV for 18 months, now they can offer it for £14.00.Which is still more expensive than current supplier. My point.... You can not believe anything they say, as they appear to pluck figures of money and quotes out of fresh air. No customer support or loyalty. Once very good, years ago, but have lost their way and become complacent with a take it or leave it attitude.... Choose to leave it, would suggest you do the same."
Lauren Watson,4,1,"Customer service is shocking! Was on thr phone for 2 hours, 7 customer service advisers later!! all kept phobing problem off, placed back in a queue etc! Quick to take £££ but not quick to help"
Customer,35,1,"Spoken to no less than 14 people over the last 4 months after trying to leave Sky. Don't worry, they have a 'Retentions Team' who just lie. They tell you a load of rubbish about discounts to keep you and you agree a price. I went for £39 (for anyone wanting to compare) just for basic TV package (Signature?), Superfast Broadband and Line Rental. Oh...line rental is £0 a month but you get an entire bill for that and load of crap. Pay as you go, basically. I signed up for 18 months and was rather happy with £39pm. After what can only be described as a tsunami of emails ""Thank you for your order..."", ""Welcome to Sky..."" etc etc I realised none of these showed the price I was promised and had the most complicated way of working out prices. E.g. 'usual' price of £28, -£8 (for 6 months) -£7 (for 18 months), PLUS £10 admin fee for changing my package (even though out of contract), -£2 for broadband (for 2 months)...and so on. Nobody can explain why the price in the 'future bills' part never shows the £39 I have done a deal for. So the manager agreed and has credited my account with a random £67, applied December not November because November is already generated... Everyone I speak to there says the whole billing this is stupid. You have different start dates for TV, broadband etc and all these offers last different amounts of time. Effectively you should do a deal on the ORIGINAL PRICE of the package, which they never discuss, and not the offers as they are applied on the day. Absolute joke. Tried comparing them to something else like a phone contract- you pay the price for the length of the contract, none of this chopping and changing and they they proceeded in explaining to me for 2 hours how the December is +£7, but dont worry because this is accounted for in January which is -£11. THEN December the admin fee will be applied but then in January its -£20 and I already have some in the £67.50 credit in November. TOO COMPLICATED TO UNDERSTAND- MIS-SELLING if you ask me!"
Robert keeffe,2,1,"Aaaah I wrote to them to tell them I was canceling my subscription, tried to ring numerous times so I just cancelled my direct debit now I've a company emailing with a threatening letter every other day saying I owe them €70 and to top it all off I posted them back the 2 boxes 6 weeks ago then they email me today to tell me if I don't send them back I'll have to pay for them can someone tell me what the hell do I do with them there an absolute joke should I see a solicitor and send them a letter for harassment"
Paul yates,1,1,Rang in to review my package and contract. After reviewing my contract and offering me apparently significant discounts it was reduced by £3. They know they have customers trapped due to the service they provide. Their pricing is so inconsistent and is basically made up. I have the same package as a friend and he’s pay half of what I pay. A complete con and the company need investigating.
lisa palmer,4,1,"Truly awful! And that's just the customer service. Developed equipment fault after 2 years & told I'd have to sign up to new contract to get my fault fixed.And the new contract was more expensive.(Well knock me down with a feather, who'd have thought, Sky asking for more money? I'm quite surprised at that! Naaat!). I suggested that I didn't want to sign up for a pricier contract, I was told that the price was good  because, yes, I'd get my fault fixed, and that was the only way I could get it sorted.(I was told of this pretty much in the manner of a Judge sentencing me stealing poorly orphans Christmas presents. I'm obviously an evil human who deserves verbal humiliation!) Pointed out the logic ridiculousness of the scenario. Was told it's my fault if I wasn't able to secure a better contract price by pressuring staff etc as some customers do that.So only by being pushy, we can get faults fixed?? Poor pensioners & vulnerable people- you've done worse with my pensioner Mum, ignored her valid concerns, being aggressive, pushing her into upgrading package with inaccurate information on what was in package.I work with older people like most of us that do, we don't tend to have conversations that include phrases like""You didn't understand me"""" I can't help you""and such joys as""Well you'll have to pay more because of your error"".Those 2 staff member were absolute charmers.Apologies and shout out to the decent staff that work there :)Cancelled with great pleasure!!"
Angela Mann,9,1,"It is not possible to email Sky, message or unless you’re prepared to wait 30 mins for response speak to someone on the telephone! Such a frustrating Company but they are quick enough to increase subscriptions!"
Mr Patrick Wray,5,5,"HELLO, may i say a BIG thank u 2 ""WAYNE"" for being so nice & under standing of my situation & so nice of him, i have been in customer services for 45 years as a concierge & doorman at hilton , dorchester est, it was nice two have that lovely service given back  two me, iv been with sky a long time & like 2 say a very big thank u two all your staff, kind regards MR P.WRAY . ps, please can u pass this on 2 him for the great service & patient & kindness he has given out, he a credit two sky."
Lars Vinther,6,1,"Sky is awful in every conceivable way. They promise an average rate of ""59 mbit/s download and 16 mbit/s upload"" for what they classify as being ""superfast"" broadband (I beg to differ that these speeds would classify as ""superfast"" anywhere outside of the Sahara desert though).Sky's definition of ""average"" is clearly different from the standard mathematical definition of ""average"", so you should consider yourself lucky if your download speeds exceed 40 mbit/s and upload speeds exceed 8 mbit/s. Essentially you're only getting ~60% of the product you are paying for.Advertising their broadband speeds as ""average of X mbit/s"" when they clearly can't execute this in real life, is false advertisement and grossly misleading.To pile on top of this, their customer support is ridiculous!! There is no way to chat to them online, so the only way to get in touch is via phone, and most of their numbers just go to some answering machine which ends up with you getting an SMS with a useless link that you can follow to get ""more information"". This link does not provide anything of value and it is a complete waste of time. If you're lucky enough to find a number that actually works, you can expect to be waiting in a phone queue for an hour. When I tried to cancel my subscription, after a long time searching, I finally found a number to call which is found on their own website on a sub page called ""cancel-sky-broadband"". However having dialed that number and waited in queue for a good half hour, I spoke to someone who apparently was NOT dealing with cancellations, and now I have to wait in queue AGAIN. So their own website sends you down the wrong path - are they deliberately trying to confuse and trick their customers?? If you end up talking to someone technical, you will get to speak to some poor chap who is desperately trying to figure out why the ""broadband"" speed you are getting is so bad, and maybe send you a new router even though the problem clearly is not the router itself, but the connection going into the building. Of course none of the Sky employees, or their Openreach companions, were able to help with the less-than-satisfactory speeds at all.Luckily Virgin operates in my area as well, so Sky will be losing yet another customer today."
Darren S,3,1,"Minimum is 1 star, if I could I would give ZERO stars. I have been waiting for a credit since Feb 2020. Finally got through to someone in July who said it would be added to my Aug bill. It didn't happen. We are now Oct and I am still waiting. No easy contact unless you have 1hour+ to wait on hold (I don't - I have a life+family). Tried online chat - never works. Tried Twitter - have to wait 2/3 hours for a reply and the only power they have is to give you a phone number (so useless service). I will be leaving Sky after almost 7 years when my current contract is up. Not the service it used to be. Sad really."
Alex,1,1,"This is absolutely awlful, I ordered the iPhone 12 Pro and it was meant to be delivered 29th October but we are self isolating which means he can deliver it anywhere so we said leave it over the gate but he couldn’t be arsed to look at the sign and are going to deliver it another day, terrible terrible manners!!!!!"
Consumer,8,1,"My vulnerable 81 year old uncle has been led a merry dance by this company, disgusting customer service... being charged for services no good for over 2 months. No end in sight. Contempt beyond belief...Still no response or actions!!"
Sheila,19,1,I have been with Sky for a long time over the years and this time for the last 18 months but they only provide special offers for new customers and forget about their loyal customers when it comes to the possibility of renewing contracts.
Patrick Sweeney,1,1,Signed a new contract with SKY in march but kept getting emails advising me to return equipment or il be charged 130 euro. Took no notice as I was getting the new bill price paying it then got another email last week advising I am now being charged 130 euro for not returning the equipment. I rang SKY straight away on hold a hour couldn't get through rang Monday got through and the service agent apologised and said he would get rid of this charge ASAP and someone from complaints department would ring me. I got a alert from my bank last night sky are trying to take the 130 euro. This is ILLEGAL SKY I have a new contract with you. I tried ringing today they have turned of the service lines. I will be going to my solicitor if this is not rectified and compensation given.
Hazel Hardie,2,1,"UPDATE: Now resolved. With help from The Sun, Sky priority contacted me and I now have Sky Q. Thank you Cat (and Lee who originally tried to help me). SKY ultimate TV Lidl offer advertised in The Sun and The Express for £18.75 per month in Aug 2020, been trying to join since to no avail. Kept fobbing me off re delays due to Covid. Now telling me adverts were wrong and will not honour. DISGRACEFUL. Reporting them to Advertising Standards."
biba binotti,12,1,"I'm so frustrated as I have issues with my broadband and there is no way at all of emailing, speaking to or having a live chat with an advisor. All phone messages and online contacts all lead to following tests on the website but I have done these and still have issues so there is no way of contacting Sky for help. moreover, the phone message asks for mobile number to send a text through with a link and I have done this 4 times now and no link comes to my phone so the processes and systems aren't working even. In this current time when we are all so dependent on internet to not have any support at all is shocking. I am at my wits end as there is no way to get help. Absolutely terrible service"
H sparks,2,1,"Man i would give 0 stars if I could! You make mistakes and expect your customers to pay for them, we cannot get hold of anyone and everything has to be done online! You then charge the wrong card and then charge double amount. No one go with sky they are grabbing money a**holes"
LADY Z,6,1,"Would give a ZERO if there was an option.Such a bunch of idiotas !!! quick to take your money - but what do you get for it, engineers come late & when they do - because we payed premium to come quicker than 4 MONTHS TO INSTALL !!!!! - we were hustled - i know !!!The engineers said there is a wall there - we didn't know we had to drill the wall to put the wire through !!! We have a drill & offered as they said they weren't qualified & never had the tools, even though they pulled up in a van & their job title is installation engineers !!!! So when we offered to drill for them - we were accused of trying to give them Covid !!!!!3 engineers & so many furious calls later, the box & modem come late, the internet doesn't work past the living room, customer service is horrendous , they caused me 4 seizures {as I now worked from home due to an accident & stress causing me seizures } one phone call was recorded where the stress caused me seizre & the putta on the other end was heard lauging & saying to someone '' here listen she's passing out hahaha !!!!! ''So many reasons they shouldn't be in business, such a rip off NEVER USE SKY !!!!"
That Guy,1,1,This was the worst experience with any provider I’ve ever had. They completely suck sooo much. They made 3 different appointments to send an engineer to my house 3 different times and every single damn time the engineer would mark me as not home. They’re lazy and very unprofessional. Overall I would never ever recommend them to anyone!
ciaran kelly,1,1,Absolutely lousy service as my Sky connection is down for five days and impossible to speak with anyone-lines are too busy and get cut off. The problem with Sky is it has monopoly and frankly does not give a crap....if enough people complain maybe we should petition a Sky cancellation month and this may bring them to their senses! The longer you are with Sky you pay more.....no loyalty appreciation!
Hetal Taylor,1,1,"Engineer visit was supposed to arrive 12 days ago. once arrived, he asks for a router to connect to the fibre. NO ROUTER WAS DELIVERED. It has been over a month since order has been placed and on the 'Track my order' part of the website it still says ""Coming Soon"". Called sky customer service and put me on hold for an hour then said go to the website for help which was not there. Stupid!"
Nathan J,15,1,"Sky Mobile !! Hidden costs!!! Very miss leading on swapping devices!!! THERE IS NO CANCELLATION PERIOD FOR SWAPPING A DEVICE!! To me there should be a cancellation period as there is for returning a device. Wanted to make a formal complaint and was told I could, but it would be opened and closed! I had to ask her to repeat that as to me that’s saying we don’t listen or care if you complain!!! So I’m stuck paying £264 for an upgrade. They confirmed that they believe a customer can afford to upgrade monthly!! Which to me sounds absolutely crazy! Asked to speak to a manager, didn’t get the privilege I was put on hold instead. And basically told nope. Ps sky don’t start your call with, as you put it “long and loyal customer, along with the years, months and days” and then basically shut me down and say quiet sternly you will have to pay and we will not be returning your fully working device!!!!"
Sue Stichbury,3,1,I decided to leave sky after 30 odd years. Would never go back to them. I have had so many issues about sending their prescious stuff back. It was sent back about 8 weeks ago then today I get a threatening email that unless I pay they will send debt collectors round.  Disgusted. So phoned they have the goods but because some are working fron home they don't always get told. Think yourself lucky working from home and do your job properly  I can't as I work in a special needs school and am 65
Richard Harrisson,1,1,"Can’t install due to surrounding trees and promised by 3 different people, that no money would be taken. Ha ha ha laughable, money taken and still waiting a month later for a refund! Awful awful awful! AVOID! Go with a different provider!!"
ER,8,1,"Without a doubt the worst experience I have had with a broadband provider or any company for that matter. Sky have caused me actual emotional distress during an already difficult time. I have spoken to about 10 different members of the customer service team, my internet went down on the 5th October, we were told it would be fixed by the 9th, still not working, I upgraded our service in the hopes this would improve, then we were told 19th it would be activated. 3 separate incompetent or lazy engineers were sent out and didn't activate or finish the fix on the fault so this delayed it a further week. We were told their manager was driving home so couldn't give them a code and that meant they couldn't fix it and had no way of making sure someone came the next day to finish the job.  This cost another 3 days.  The internet was eventually fixed on the 26th.  I was told a manager would contact me about my complaint.  They called me twice during working hours when I was on client calls and couldn't pick up.  Now they are saying the policy is to close the complaint if the three calls are missed.  I suspect they deliberately call at awkward times so they don't have to handle the mess they have created for their customers. I have been in severe emotional distress not being able to work remotely, I had to spend 2 days working from cafes putting me at increased risk of contracting Covid, on the 3rd day I had developed a cough and a fever, so now I am having to isolate due to Skys utter incompetence and lack of care for urgency for their customers' internet requirements.  I can't comprehend the number of customer service people I have encountered, all of them saying 'that's policy, there's nothing more we can do'.  Absolutely horrendous experience, please go with a provider who is not reliant on the BT Openreach network. I will be."
Kirstie,1,1,"All was day spent trying to temporarily cancel my subscription via online, sms and phone. The average wait time was 20 minutes to speak to a person. Finally got through and the call was disconnected!!!! Its now 5.20pm, and I'm still no further forward than when I started at 10am!!! Appalling customer service, we will not be returning."
Sean Neary,7,1,Absolutely shocking customer service. I am getting emails about being charged for not returning equipment after cancelling contract. I have not cancelled any contract! I moved house that's all. On hold for 39 minutes to be cut off. No issues taking payment every month. You don't have enough CS Agents to speak with the customers you are charging. Employ more staff rather than being greedy!
Seth Rosenberg,1,1,"Without doubt the WORST customer service in the world.It is impossible to talk to a real person and the website is unable to assist with my problem.As a new resident of the UK, I am now convinced that SKY does not value their customers and therefore I will now opt out of using SKY.Given the TRUSTPILOT ratings on the web, it is clear that customer service is not a priority.Bye Bye Sky - I'm off to a service provider who cares!"
Colin Penrose,1,1,"Is am very sad to write this mail but I believe SKY is a very inhumane organization that uses automated emails, they do not read these emails and do not respond in writing to any responses / emails. You can respond / email them but you do not get a personalized response to your very difficult situation."
Brendan Moss,8,1,"Do not switch to SkyQ from your old standard Sky set up. Its got an awful userfriendly platform, search features long-winded and confusing even the remote control is featureless black and blank and almost impossible to make out any of the control keys in low light. Just glad I've kept my old box and as soon as my tie in contract is over it will be OUT with the Sky Q box in and with the old."
Wendy Greening,3,1,Terrible company. We cancelled our subscription in June and switched to a Virgin but Sky are still taking £52 each month from my bank. We cancelled our direct debit but now Sky are adding late Late payment fees and threatening legal action. All telephone numbers are suspended (unless your want to join Sky) and live chat is also suspended. Emailed customer services and CEO Jeremy Darroch but emails not even acknowledged.
Rene Gramsch,2,1,I would give 0 Points but it is not possible.You pay so much money for the contract and you have to watch advertisements before the movie that is sad.First they lose the soccer games and sport and then they don’t care about their customers and they only want to earn money that is how you ruin the company.
JAV,5,1,"SKY IS TERRIBLE!!I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO SOMEONE TO SPEAK TO THEM ABOUT MY BILL BUT THEIR FRICKING AUTOMATED SERVICE AND IVR OPTIONS ARE INFURIATING AND BULLSH*T!!! ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE AND NOT A FRICKING ROBOT!!!THE SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS AND FRICKING P*SSTAKEONCE I FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO SOMEONE, THEY KEPT TRANSFERRING ME TO DIFFERENT FRICKING DEPARTMENTS!!!! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY JOKE!!!! SOMEONE BETTER GET THIS SORTED!!!"
charles craig,10,1,be careful  what you agree to as they bump up the price and sell you products that you dont want without you realizing and when you get it find that  Netflix and its competitors are far better  and a lot cheaper
Isabella,2,4,Waleed was amazing!Yes we spent 1hour and 15minutes on the phone getting passed around to different people however the last person we got Waleed did an amazing job. Helped us get the best price he could possibly find for us. He really went out of his way for us and I really appreciated it. If you see this Waleed thank you so much!
ade,13,1,"You can see why they're one of the worst customer service reputations in the country - they're so bad it's difficult to put into words!20 mins queuing to query why I'm being overcharged, passed to some other department and hung up after another 45 mins on hold.I've been with them >20 years and every support call gets worse and worse, they scrapped online chat ages ago to save on staff costs and now even prevent you from raising a support ticket online - they're taking money off me I don't owe and the only way I can get them to take any notice is too cancel my DD!what contempt to treat your customers with"
Mike Lambert,3,5,"Call times to get through to customer services - quite slow! Two calls today, one waited 30 minutes, the second 20 minutes - I'm not sure what the average is, but... Once through to them I have always found the customer service personnel really friendly and helpful. As an out-of-contract renewing customer I could see big differences between what I was paying now, and what I would pay as a new customer. Called through to the retention team and they have been able to match the offers I was seeing, and save me over £25/month - given that I am upgrading from standard to superfast broadband I was happy with the price I got. Then I was able to make additional savings on Sky Mobile - my wife and I have unlimited calls and texts, plus all the data we need, for £14/month - that seems like a good deal to me. There does seem a willingness to reward customer loyalty and work with customers to find a deal. Happy customer."
Samantha Liddell,1,1,"Appalling service on hold for hours every time try to get through. None mail facility, however, can e mail to say they are going to charge you for a box that has been returned. Will never use them again!"
Aoife Kenny,4,1,"Sky provided terrible internet with very slow speed, when I did cancel they continued to charge me. This has taken hours to sort out and I have still not received a refund. I would strongly advise against using their services."
Kayleigh Baker,1,1,Taking money out of my account we paided it on the 14th and they took it again today
Gavin Cook,2,1,"Another low for Sky - putting premier League games on box office. I already can't watch the boxing due to Sky's greed now we're back to football. What am I getting for the cost of Sky sports? Sky's arrogance is astounding and, what's more they're clearly cashing-in on COVID. Disgraceful companyZero stars - very poor value for money."
Gaz E,11,1,"Not answering the phone. Still no LiveChat service.They have had 8 months to improve things.You cannot blame Covid, this is down to staff cuts.I'll be cancelling as soon as my contract is up"
Tim K,1,2,"I have been with Sky for over 20 years and I am a diamond VIP member, not that it means anything as I get treated the same as everyone else !I’ve had trouble with Sky broadband for the past few months and trying to contact them is very difficult (they seem to blame COVID-19 for not being able to respond)Eventually I found a complaint form on their website and filled it in, within 30 minutes I got a phone call asking what my problem was.To be fair the guy who spoke to me tried to be helpful and I explained that I was having trouble with my broadband, it kept buffering even when there was just me in the house ( we have superfast fibre broadband allegedly!) he did a speed check and it varied between 0 and 45 MB, I sent him a photo of where my router was positioned even though I’d never had a problem for years, I spent over an hour resetting everything and eventually he said it was a WiFi issue and he couldn’t do anything about it although he could send me the new SKY hub for an extra £100 and yet another 18 month contract !By this time I’d had enough so I asked when my contract was ending as I was going to cancel at which point he offered me £5 off a month !! WowNeedless to say come December I will be cancelling Sky broadband and Sky Q tv and going to a company that gives a damn about their customers"
Rob Woolley,1,1,"If only I could give Sky zero stars!  Sky Q never worked on the mini boxes, their routers are junk so mini boxes really need 4mb to work wirelessly - got 35mb wired from router but less than a 1mb from the meshed wireless network! Their equipment is junk and their only solution was to ask me to hardwire the whole system! Judging by the quality of the external wiring installation I would not give them any chance of creating havoc in my house!  When I cancelled they kept saying I was a VIP - didn’t get treated like that!  Gone to BT far happier all round and half the price!  Latest kick in the teeth is that I get once week - please come back - the offer they gave me was £17.50 - my neighbour who has changed to BT too was sent exactly the same letter apart from the price - he got £15.00 per month offer. Neither of us are taking their offer!"
Alan Dixon,6,1,Charging football fans on box office now extra £15 to watch something i already pay money for is disgusting... greed .. thats all it is... when my subscriptions end im not renewing football 😡😡😡😡 ... disgrace !!!!!By the way that one star is a minus 10 star... fools 😡
Shawn,4,5,"Short version: Probably the best customer support experience I have had, would definately recommend. After reading the poor scores on Trustpilot for Sky I was about to look elsewhere when I realised that all the major companies have poor reviews on various review sites. Sky were offering a frankly unbelievable deal on the new iPhone 12 so I read through all the small print to find the catch but apart from it being a 3 year contract there wasn't one. (You still end up paying less for the phone than comparable offers) So I decided to go ahead and order on the Sky mobile website, unfortunately because I have Sky movies on my nowtv box I presumed I was a customer and tried to sign in, this put me in a loop saying I wasn't recognised sign in again and I couldn't progress any further so I called customer services. It was peak time and the recorded message said there was a 20 minute wait, however the phone was answered in a few seconds. I spoke to a guy called DJ and he was absolutely brilliant. He helped me undo the jam id gotten into by trying to sign in to a non existent Sky account and helped me purchase the phone and set up the contract patiently and step by step. I asked if it was possible to get the phone in time for my sons birthday but he said that pre-orders had started 3 days earlier so when the phones arrived on the 23rd the first people would take priority and we would probably take delivery on the 25/26th.Unbelievably the phone arrived on the 23rd the same day they came into the warehouse and my son got his birthday present!. Well done Sky make sure all your people are trained to the same level as DJ."
Gurnam Singh,2,1,"What a absolute terrible experience.  I have spent half of Saturday trying to contact Sky customer services. Average wait was 30 minutes, I tried about 5 times that's 150 minutes!! Then final time for 1hour 5 minutes I held on phone.. all i got was their stupid music. In the end I gave up. Shocking SKY TV experience for myself. And I was calling to set up a new account as a new customer!! Absolute disgrace by SKY. They should be ashamed of themselves."
Mr. T,7,1,"Absolutely terrible , change from bt they said come to us for a better deal , Everybody beware do NOT do it ,I wish I’d never bothered , cut our phone line off , blamed bt So now no phone line , broadband Or red care alarm !!! Totally uneceptable I will be taking legal action against Sky"
Gilers,4,1,"Absolute joke, avoid sky mobile like the plague. The staff you speak to are very pleasant but totally clueless. Sky mobile give sky a bad reputation. Maybe management need to look at these reviews and get their house in order!"
Anonymous,7,1,"Terrible customer service I've been listening to music for 1.5 hours, they cannot be bothered to even talk you. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY"
Pat Man,2,1,Called Sky Mobile to discuss the plan which I thought was £15 that included sim and phone. Turns out it's sim and handset separately. The customer service was below standard and an hour after speaking to three people. I was told if I want more than the 2g data on offer I should pay more. When I asked to cancel sim and get an O2 one since they piggy back on them. The response was to use our phone you need our sim. The whole experience just felt like I'm in a hostage situation. This is not right on so many levels.  Wouldn't recommend them to any one please stay away from them.
Kate Williams,1,1,"What a complete disappointment. No customer service, delay upon delay and when the work was finally completed the engineer left leaving a lump out of the side of our house. I have tried calling and emailed and still no response. There is no care or respect to Sky customers."
Penny פני אנתוני Anthony,2,1,"Ever since I got a second mini-box, my Sky TV connections have been problematic and erratic.  Sky claims that 'Over 90% of our customers who use our online guides get the help they need before even having to get in touch' well what if you are in the 10% who HAVE to get in touch? It's IMPOSSIBLE to get past the automated Scottish lady.  She keeps promising to help me as soon as she can and then declares that she's sending me an SMS that will take me to their online help and tells me to hang up. These SMS messages appear to be lost in cyberspace and their online help, that I managed to find all by myself, has been no help at all.An apologetic team member gave me the number of the TECH TEAM and assured me that I would get straight through to them.  UNTRUE. I was told that the best time to call would be late evening as the lines were less busy.  UNTRUE.I was told, after spending literally hours on the phone to engineers, that my frequent connectivity problem would be permanently resolved.  UNTRUE.A bad-tempered team member with a strong Irish accent berated me for expecting the service to be better than it was.  He was only prepared to use the term 'shouldn't' and not 'wouldn't' to describe the likelihood of my connectivity going down regularly.I am currently sitting in front of a blank TV screen.I am going to cancel my contract as the service that I am being offered is not of merchantable quality.SKY, YOU ARE AWFUL.  Your 'customer service' is in breach of the trades descriptions act - you do not offer a service.  If anyone happens to read this, whatever you do - DO NOT SUPPORT SKY."
David Haskell,1,1,"A 90 year old lady sky customer has a fault on the landlines such that the sky talk & broadband package is   not is not worikng. She has asked for my help but can not remember her password or security details.I contacted sky customer services but there agents were no help at all, lthough very polite they just kept repeating that nothing could be done without my knowing the account details. So a confused elderly customer is still without a phone & Sky are doing nothing to help."
Customer,3,1,Sky upgrade to sky q. Engineer unplugged freeview connection without telling us. Now other tvs in house wont work.  No telephone customer service at the moment.  Please Virgin Media can you start operating in our area.
mark,4,1,"here we go again, they take my money, you cannot contact them, I have had slow broadband for 4 months, they never call back, they never transfer you to sort out the problem, you can call them and be a new customer and god they are so quick to answer and talk to you. Today i have run 3 independent speed test and the are all under 7, go and run one on the sky page 12!! If it was not for the sports and tv package, i would kick them into touch. Un-helpful, un-contactable, and not caring for a customer for over 20 years."
sandra stevens,11,1,"awful service, cant get through on the phone, keeps sending texts to visit sky, pretty hard with no broadband, had engineer for no phone line, said fault was outside,have now messed my broadband up which was working perfectly, 15 years sky and I will be leaving you after this fiasco, over 2 hours wasted trying to speak to someone for an engineer re visit."
Kirsten Bridgen,5,1,"Terrible customer service and ‘customer experience’ - needs serious improvement. When will Sky take notice off all of the bad reviews?? Long and boring story but we have had 2 engineers out, one was at our house for over 3 hours. Issue not resolved and to be investigated. Somehow the responsibility is on us to keep contacting sky about this which involves a 30 min wait each time then a lengthy explanation to the call assistant as there are no notes and no one has any idea what’s been going on. Oh and WE have to call sky back once issue is resolved to be refunded for the weeks / months loss of service. Shockingly bad and we are close to closing our sky account."
Michael Burrows,35,2,The sales person I spoke to gave me the wrong information. They told me that I could have 2 accounts on 1 email address.  So then I had to ring for help and was on hold for 50 mins.  Sky did then solve my problem.  You need a seperate email if you have more than 1 account or address. Wow most people give only 1 star.  The government needs to create competicion.
JB,4,1,Very poor customer service to say what a large company Sky are! I have been with Sky TV and broadband a long time but loyalty doesn’t get you any better service. Website to sign up to Sky Mobile is shocking so I called to join. Initially was impressed with the advisor then when it came to talking about Sky iD and linking accounts sounded like he wanted to end the call. Unsurprisingly I encountered issues! Another two phone calls later no further on!!! In addition to this Sky make it extremely difficult for you to speak to an advisor!!!Days later I managed to figure out the problem myself despite not working for Sky it’s laughable I found a fix to my problem when their own advisors cant solve the problem. To add to poor service already received - my ‘pre ordered’ phone no sign of it and no communication whatsoever stating it’s delayed! After reviewing social media it seems this is not an isolated incident! Shocking to see when researching Sky how bad their service actually is!!!! Would be great if they would stop ignoring people’s pre order questions and acknowledge they have falsely offered this service.
John Glen,7,1,Skymobile good price and coverage.. but found it difficult to see my account and usage ..piggy bank kept saying error ...phoned sky .absolutely no chance getting someone to talk to.Website not very good for breakdown for mobile account cant access it .followed instructions. Put details in several times .hopeless .don't know why account they cannot link phoned number to your account once sign in ..all other companies do it sky make it difficult .. website No Stars .....
Aoife,5,1,I am 7 weeks with no tv. I’ve tried every method of contacting sky to get this issue resolved. Impossible to get a reply. An engineer came last week and said he’d be back in touch as he’d never seen that problem before. No word from him and again I can’t get in touch with anyone for an update. I’ve paid €180 for the past two months with no TV and no way to speak to someone to sort it out! Can’t get the service or cancel it.
DY,2,1,Can never get through to SKY to change anything with account been waiting 20 minutes to speak to someone absolutely disgusting service
Richard Wetenhall,7,3,"I recently updated my Sky services and swapped out two old Sky boxes for a Sky Q and a Sky Q Mini box.  At the same time we moved our broadband and telephone to Sky.  By contrast with some, we had quite a good customer service experience in moving over, without some of the typical problems one hears of.  However we did struggle - and continue to struggle - with some aspects:1. Billing.  We negotiated hard for a good deal on our move to Sky and we’re happy with what we achieved.  However, Sky have continually got the billing wrong and haven’t got it right yet.  They keep insisting the last person made some kind of mistake.  Fortunately I kept the original quote and they have accepted that they must honour that.  But they still haven’t got it right.  2. Sky Q and WiFi.  It doesn’t work.  And their installers don’t know much about WiFi either.  My installer tried to connect things up by WiFi using Sky’s proprietary wireless mesh network, telling me it would have no effect on the rest of my WiFi, and installing boosters to get the signal sufficient for the Mini box.  Net result was a Mini box that lost the signal with monotonous regularity (at least once a day), and would require a reboot of the whole system to get it up and working again.  When “working”, the signal was hopelessly unreliable with dropouts and picture freezing, pixelation etc.  Just unwatchable.  The Sky technical support was not helpful; a lot of time on the phone amounting to the usual ‘turn it off then on again’ and no helpful advice.  We have fixed the problems now by using online advice (not from Sky), and installing a full wired connection between the boxes (which works fine).  The second problem was that the Sky WiFi certainly DID interfere with the rest of my house system.  Indeed it knocked it over on a regular basis.  And no prizes for guessing why; the installer had just whacked it onto the same radio channels as my WiFi was using, so there was massive interference between them.  Beware - the Sky engineers are really just AV engineers and don’t have anything other than the most rudimentary training in networks and WiFi.  We fixed the interference problem by turning off all the WiFi on both main Sky Q and Mini boxes once we had installed the Ethernet connection between them.  Be aware you have to get into the engineer’s menu to do that, and Sky do not admit it’s possible.  You can find out easily enough how to do it from the internet, though.  But be aware that if you have to reset your box, the WiFi will turn itself back on again (Sky has that as a default), so watch out for that.  Having now got to a working system, Sky Q is fine for us and, barring the billing niggle, we’re satisfied.  BUT, it’s taken me personally many hours to fix all the problems associated with the rubbish installation, and Sky and their engineers do NOT have the competence to do proper installs other than on the simplest of simple set-ups.  You need to accept you are going to be on your own in getting the system right.  Apart from that, Mrs Lincoln, I rather enjoyed the play..."
claire le tissier,5,1,Would give 0 stars but can't review without giving any! Paying for fastest broadband (should be 32-40mb) is only 19 max. They say it's 32 on their check on their site. Tried to get hold of someone to query it. IMPOSSIBLE. These big companies should be ashamed treat their customers like dirt.
Diane Cowe,1,1,"I wish I could give zero stars as their customer service is non existent. Having upgraded my old broadband, which despite the age of the hub, and it dropping out daily, it managed to reach every room in my small flat, however with the ‘new’ and supposedly better hub I now cannot get wifi in my bedroom. We had an engineer visit, and he told us we should buy a booster as there was nothing wrong with the speed coming into the flat. This is unacceptable. As I am within the cooling off period, I have now been trying to cancel my contract for 4 days and no one answers the phone. They have a helpful voice msg which asks for a mobile number so they can send you a link to the website so they can direct me to the appropriate help, this effectively takes me to the web page I am already on. I feel like I am in a circle of hell. The online form I could fill in to make a complaint will not load, their chat is unavailable ALL DAY and it says it takes them longer to answer emails. They have utterly exhausted my patience. I can’t use the words I really want to express my frustration at the abject failure of this company to provide even the most  of basic customer services. They are a disgrace. And by the way Covid is no longer an acceptable excuse."
Aran LeThiul,38,4,"Can only comment about them in relation to Broadband services, however I have been with them many years and have never really had any issues. Occasional outages have been brief and if I have bothered getting in touch with them they refunded a day/2 day’s fees.My recent deal with them was very good for fibre broadband (very close to market leading price).Don’t give them 5 stars as only negative point I have really is it can be difficult to speak to them (they seem to try everything on their website to avoid someone calling, with even getting a contact number being difficult)."
Arvinder Virdee,2,1,"The Worst viewing experience of the lot! skyq mini box is slow and laggy. SkyGo never connects and has a thousand issues with it, by the time you start and restart the app you lose interest in what your watching. absolute waste of time. Broad band sucks, always dropping in and out of connection, customer service will walk you around the bush and nothing is ever resolved long term. seriously flawed and pathetic."
Gary Barkham,1,1,"Came to renew my sky package after 18 months and been totally hammered with fees and overpriced bills, broadband still hasn't been upgraded after 3 week and been charged a 'standard tariff monthly rate' feels like there legally emptying by bank account.."
Paul Field,2,1,"Tring to phone sky to cancel BT sports, now been waiting 45 mins and still in queue. Wonder how fast the call would have been if I wanted to add somthing"
adrian pearson,4,1,"Dire!! Chose virgin if you haven’t already picked your supplier. Just look at the Trustpilot reviews!!Broadband went down, can’t contact anyone and 3 weeks for an engineer. What a joke"
Jason Cooke,57,1,Impossible to reach this mob. I need to renegotiate and renew my contract. Could someone please answer the phone!More cov-id excuses.
Alireza Nikoo,3,2,"I called Sky at 14:12, 21/10/20 and after 10 mints or so behind the line a funny advisor picked up the phone and he just said a couple of time while I was speaking to him, he just ignored me , like he was happy to see people stay behind the line , and ignore them because no one can track him later and ask him why you make fun of people by cutting his phone. You must teach them how to work , don't pay them at the end of the month because they don't do anything for you , at least some of them ."
ranjit dhami,7,1,"Can’t get through and when you do your speaking to people abroad who are like repetitive robots.  Have had issues with sky box for over 10 months and nothing resolved yet Finally booked an engineer visit but due to caring responsibilities away from the house needed to know if the appointment would be in the morning or afternoon.  Again unable to help!!!I can’t take this couldn’t care less attitude anymore, they are the worst company to deal with.  They say there’s nothing that be done for more vulnerable customers"
Consumer,2,1,worst customer service internet is always dropping people working in sky are also rude and worst broadband. mobile hotspot gives more mbps then sky router. wonder how they aint getting bankrupt
carl 10,2,1,"Poor service, ridiculous prices once contract has expired. Broadband speeds very slow. BT now giving me 80mbps instead of 35 mbps with sky, and for £10 a month less. Also got TV services via other means for £50 per year!"
Cons CB,1,1,I recently moved house and advised Sky some 2 weeks in advance. The TV services moved very quickly but my broadband was downgraded in the process - I have attempted to explain this to Sky customer services on the telephone (after being on hold for over an hour) yet they can't see the issue. Appalling assistance offered and appalling wait tines. Companies need to stop using Covid as an excuse for horrendous customer service.
Tanni,1,5,"Jay from the customer service team was an absolute delight and great support.  Very patient and supportive.  Forward thinking, ensured my services  were on and I was happy 😊 A very valuable member of the team. BT Sports and Services connected to broadband very efficiently."
Scott Hope,2,1,Because their wifi is absolutely f*cki** shi*
Julian Rose,9,1,"Poor company who value new customers over old. If it wasn’t because Virgin are not in our area I’d have left a while ago. Not because Virgin is any better, just that it’s only through customer churn that Sky and these companies will get better. It’s our complacency enables them to act so poorly."
HELEN,3,1,"Bought a TV and broadband package - on the day broadband was due to go live received a call to say it would be mid the following week. 2 days before this date, a call to say it would now be the next week instead.....and so on. They are not willing to provide any solution for the interim despite this meaning cannot work remotely. Awful service."
Jonny Human,1,1,When you try to cancel they simply don't answer the phone and then just cut you off! I suppose it's one way of trapping your customer to stay.
James,3,1,"I helped my 90 year old dad move over to a £25 sky broadband/phone package to save money. They said they will take over the line and broadband (separate providers) yet they seemed to have failed on both accounts.I have provided my mobile to take the calls for my dad and received a text to ring. Yet every time I ring it just wants to send me to a help page, despite the fact that it is prioritising over 70s. There is also no option for online chat or email. Just ring (which you cannot get through) or write, and who does that these days.They are now going to ring my 90 year old dad on the landline on Friday, good luck with that.Awful, awful service."
Rob Millard,4,1,"I recently renewed my sky TV and telephone service for a further 18 months to include the sky signature package at £25 per month as from September 2020. Imagine my annoyance to see the recent deal to have the signature package and Netflix for £25 a month. I have checked Sky VIP where I am a platinum customer to see if I can get this deal. I can only get Netflix for an extra £4 a month. There is no option to get the £25 deal despite the offer saying it is available to new and EXISTING customers. I can telephone Sky but waiting times are over 20 minutes! It is obvious that sky have the technology to make deals available to new customers but expect them to jump through additional hoops to get this deal. I am unhappy at this appalling failure to provide this option to current customers. I am even more annoyed to see Sky spending money to pay Edris Elba, Rita Ora and others to promote Sky VIP when they do not provide a proper service to their longstanding and loyal customers."
Shakeel Bashir,1,1,"What a pathetic company stay away!!!Im not the type to write reviews but I had to share this, Sky is doing my head in ! I’ve been waiting a week now for Sky to fix my broadband and all Sky can say to me is “we can’t do anything until BT openreach update their database which is after 6pm only then we will know what is going on “.  I have a daughter who is at home on isolation for a two week period from her school, she cannot do any of the work set by her school it’s all online on the school portal. This is taking liberties I pay every month for a service and my DD is taken not a minute late and Sky cannot fix the problem and they advise to wait another day !  Wait another day ! I’m tired of hearing that. I’m gona check my contract and leave this dead useless company I was so much better of with virgin media they know how to look after their customers.  Sky customer service is crap and half the time when I spoke to them I could hardly understand what the representive was saying."
David Woods,15,1,"Well it's approaching the end of the line with my loyalty to Sky TV....... Having been a customer since around 1996 we've had our ups and downs but its always been difficult to leave as they have monopolised the market. Today there are more choices and I can happily leave when my contract ends. What's triggered this is simply appalling. In November 2019 I took out a Sky Q package on a £1.50 Black Friday offer from an on-street Sky Sales person. When the engineer came to fit the box I was offered NETFLIX free for two months which gave a go. However, when checking my bill afterwards I have not been charged £1.50 but £7.00. I attempted to contact sky but due to COVID 19 I was unable to do so at all.In addition, my Q Box constantly freezes and switches itself off. The internet constantly has issues to which I get text messages from sky telling me there is a problem. On contacting Sky today19/10/2020 I was able to get a new box sent out and an engineer to look at the internet connection. What I find unacceptable is that there is no record of my agreement for the Q Box therefore Sky will not reimburse the £60-£70 (ish) I have over-payed. Not much but I feel its the point of the matter that agreements are made but there's no record of the contract.So, to that end with ever increasing subscriptions and unethical practices it'll be a goodbye to Sky.I'm sure SKY will cope without me though........"
Sue,27,1,"No option to downgrade and remove Sky Cinema on line. Have to call them who, after asking the usual security questions, want to know what the verbal password is which was set up years ago by another member of the family who has now moved out and transferred the account to me. Can upgrade online but not downgrade. Utterly ridiculous"
Ian Lane,1,1,Why why why is the BLM banner still on sky sports ?? U.K. is not a racist country against blacks Maybe against whites yes . No police killings in the U.K. of innocent blm . Beyond stupid .
Hayley Bostock,8,1,"Really dissapointed with Sky. I've been an existing customer for some years and given covid, furlough and redundancy was looking to downgrade my package. However, sky have been very unforgiving. It was my impression, Sky always took better care of existing customers, but obviously this is no longer their ethos. The fact they will only answer calls to new customers and those wishing to upgrade says it all. I would have thought with BT now able to offer Sky Atlantic, they would be willing to improve their customer service but obviously not."
Robert Burridge,2,1,"I cancelled my Sky contract and account was closed 4 September.  Money was taken for the period until the third week of that month, so I have overpaid. They owe me £32 according to My Account. They have had £32 from me for six weeks. No point phoning because you join an endless queue. Can't  e mail, they don't provide an address.  I have written to their address in Scotland. I have no idea when I will get my refund. This is a shocking way to treat customers."
Ellen Massey,1,1,I have recently cancelled my services due to increasing pricing. I was paying over £100 most months for basic packages. So having cancelled i found that I couldn't watch anything I had purchased separately from the sky store. E.g. the buy and keep options. Called them and they say there is nothing they can do for me after 10 yrs of custom. So I have basically bought approximately £100 worth of movies that I can not view because I have cancelled my subscription. Even though I have the old boxes that belong to me. They are downloaded to the hard drivetoo and the movies state 'buy and KEEP'. So you don't buy and keep unless you stay with sky. Leave and you don't get to keep them.
Pineapple Playz,1,1,When I play games with my friends the internet shuts down. I also get 5-30 mbps instead of getting 65-75. It is really annoying when the internet shuts down.
Construction Techniques,1,1,Never heard of a more Sh*ttiest excuse for a fu*king company Absolute fu*king scam
Tim James,6,1,"They have absolutely squeezed the pips. EXTRA to watch soccer now.Phoned to cancel, but nobody there.Who the hell do they think they are?"
Rick McMunn,8,1,SCAMMERS! I pay for Sky Sports yet I have to pay to watch a football match through Sky Box Office???
Richard Carnall,1,1,We have been charged 147 pounds per month for a year and apparently it's not sky policy to inform you that you could get a cheaper tariff. Now been on the phone for nearly an hour trying to get this sorted 😭 really disappointed to be treated this way after being a loyal customer of 20 year
Simon Dunster,1,1,The digital assistant is 100% useless. After 15 calls to attempt to get the dumb rubbish system to understand my simple question it kept reverting to sending me an sms and asking me to check on-line despite me doing this and never finding the info I needed. I tried and tried to speak to a human and in the end said cancelling sky as I have had enough. What a stupid stupid stupid way to provide customer service. I bet not one single sky director or even manager has every even used their own rubbish system and are even aware how useless it is as heads would role in every company I have ever led or worked for if I provided this rubbish to the public. It is astonishing!! Sky was once good - it is utter rubbish now!
Mr francis fitzgerald,6,1,"this has got to be the company with the worst service in England, they were meant to fit a new box in AUGUST, they never arrived or contacted me, now in the middle of October they were supposed to arrive tomorrow but failed to contact me again, they have total disdain for their customers"
david,1,1,The new sky q is to hard to navigate. We have given it our best efforts but unless you are very tech savvy it is polite poo
Martyna Grzyb,1,5,"Just to say thank you for help from Ellie(hope I spelled it right) awesome help so knowledgeable girl , extremely polite. I’m with sky more than 3 years, she was the first person who actually did what I wanted to, she deserves a big pay raise 😊😊😊😊 !!!!!!!!!!!!! Keep doing what you doing girl, you rock it !!!!!!!"
Harry,3,1,"Been waiting for almost a month now for sky to set up my broadband. The engineer never turned up despite me being assured the day before that they definitely would. Sky are blaming openreach for the delay but they refuse to chase up openreach on my behalf. I call up twice a week - often waiting for around an hour in a call queue. Sometimes they tell me that the issue is sorted just to get me off the phone and then the next day they will tell me that they are still waiting for openreach. Absolutely awful customer service, they are unable to tell you anything about what the issue might be or when it might be sorted. I would not recommend going with sky for broadband.--UPDATE--So after 4 weeks of waiting, Sky have cancelled my order with no explanation. After suffering through a few more hours on hold I get some vague explanation blaming an openreach message which never got through. Nobody informed me of this in any of the many phone calls I have made to chase up over the last month! I have now cancelled my order and will be going with talktalk. One quid extra a month to never have to deal with Sky customer service again is a no brainer. Avoid at all costs!"
Patricia Rovere de Santi,1,1,"I was sent a message saying I would be charged another 10 pounds this month. Since that is not right I decided to call them The woman who talked to me was the most patronising person i have even had the displeasure of dealing with. I get it ok ?!! customer service is hard and people can be difficult, but seriously!! she kept saying. “ you are not trying to understand me “ constantly until I finally I said : please don’t talk to me like that I am trying to “ Is distressing because her tone would have made an elderly person feel small  and stupid. Because that was the tone she decided to with.  And you know what is funny?? before she gave a rude goodbye, I finally got the answer to my question and guest what ?! she was one who hadn’t understood me. She made me go through my bills and pointing out irrelevant information. I was confused, but I thought maybe I really don’t get it. Until I repeated my question and she just said. Oh, that is wrong and to ignore that message bye. I hope sky representatives would care what kind of customer service they give. Because when they were selling me stuff they were very sweet, and today I regretted ever signing a contract with them.UpdateI called again, and this time a very sweet lady helped me with my questions. The previous lady was wrong about ignoring the message I received so it was good that I called."
Donna Palmer,1,1,Tried to have my sky fitted today. The engineer was rude VERY unhelpful refused to fit as he refused to get ontop of my conservatory or even go into my neighbor's garden. I took the day off work to do this absolutly appalled especially as i am a new customer i don't recommend them in the slightest i will go elsewhere 😡
Tracey Sandrock,1,1,"I cancelled all my Sky services in August. Cancellation to take effect on 1 October 2020. TV was cancelled but direct debit still taken for broadband on 1 October. When I called to request a refund I was told this would happen on 1 November 2020. After lodging a formal complaint I was told I could get my refund after 18 October. Unacceptable. This money should never have been taken, they were given one and a half month's notice of cancellation. I don't recommend Sky to anyone, they're sneaky thieves who increase your payments little by little without notifying you and when you try to cancel your subscription they will bring the process way down to keep you as a customer. I will never deal with them again."
Susanne Oldfield,8,1,"Where is your customer service?We have been experiencing problems with streaming throughout lockdown. Internet dropping out, programmes (Sky, Prime, Netflix) constantly freezing. During lockdown we managed to speak to Sky who said the problem was that we needed faster broadband. We arranged that but it made no difference. We haven’t been able to speak to anyone since. Someone rang to ask how we were getting on with the new package. I told him and he said he was putting me through to someone who could help but just put me through to the same automated message. I know they are working from home but so are we and we are actually doing our jobs! We are thinking of just cancelling payment. I am sure they will get in touch then. Cynical exploitation of the current situation. PICK UP THE PHONE"
Dave Doran,2,1,Been with Sky since 1989 on the first day of analogue broadcasting and in the early days they reasonable with pricing and dealing with problemsNot today they are greedy and and inconsiderate to their loyal customers and the recent issues with Box office charging £14-95 for pay per view premier league games is immoral to say the least as people who already pay a lot of money for their package are being abused by Sky and I would hope that people do not get sucked in and pay for these matches and Sky reputation these days is appalling
M Golden,10,1,"Worst experience of my life.I waited more than two months for Sky to replace my existing Sky with Sky Q. Once installed, I asked for them to refund me for the two months I literally didn’t have TV. The manager Stephen only offered me one month “as gesture of good will” after telling me that I am not in my right mind, suggesting that everything is my fault. Once I refused their offer as it was an insult (I paid for two months of no TV and not one) he deadlocked my complaint i.e. you are no longer allowed to complain To Sky on this issue. I asked fo the notes from a different agent, and I was told that the manager has mentioned that he has followed all reasonable protocol. A big corporation abusing its power when it comes to vulnerable people."
Anita Glindoni,15,1,"If I could I’d give no stars, 29 months now our sky internet just drops out completely or is too weak for sky tv or to surf the net, told by numerous openreach engineers lines are damage by trees, then advised bt not replacing any copper, then as one pole has electric on it we need the electric board here and a cherry picker openreach has one for east anglia, so three months ago a openreach surveyed the lines and poles the surveyor came to our house I’ve condemned two poles, were friggin the line underground so last month storms blew down two poles inc electric dug lines in no updates from sky customer services don’t want to know often landlines so noisy you can’t use it and my partners is NHS he has to work from home it is embarrassing it goes completely when on conference calls and working, I have a auto immune disease as it is so bad I have to go into work and we are paying in full give us our compensation or risk me escalating this to ofcom and taking it legal we’re so fed up with such poor service and communications!!  No starts"
Emma Smith,2,1,A truly dreadful experience. Our internet drops out the whole time making it impossible to work. It’s impossible to speak to anyone and we were told we’d get a voucher for £70 for the Westfield shopping centre which unsurprisingly has never arrived.
Karen Swann,7,1,Disgraceful service. We have been without a landline and broadband now for over 3 weeks and have no idea when they are going to resolve our situ. No communication. No apology. No compassion or understanding and they have stopped the live chat. It's frustrating as it is Open reach who are responsible for damaging our cables but we have to go through Sky. Sky constantly break promises stating they will update us and they don't. Explained we have vulnerable Daughter and need phone for emergency etc. They are simply not bothered. The stress and anxiety they have caused is unacceptable and cruel.
Jason Nicholas,3,1,"They are lucky i cannot give less than one star. As their tv advert states ""superfast, super reliable broadband or your money back"". Their broadband might be fast but it is not superfast nor is it super reliable. I have had just under two weeks of the speeds they promise out of four and now I am stuck in an 18 month contract of falsely advertised claims of ""super reliability or your money back"". They'll even make you pay delivery charges for equipment that doesn't work and then blame everything on openreach. What a joke! With coronavirus still at its peak and people are trying to work from home but are not able to because of sky' super (un)reliable broadband but its OK, they'll tell you to use your mobile data. What do they give in the way of compensation? £13.99 to spend buying one of their overpriced dvd's. Save your money finding a reliable broadband provider."
Pete Martucci,3,1,"Wow! Just wow. Was talking to ""customer services"" for over an hour with a simple request, kept diverting the conversation. Only interested in sales. Also seemed to go for a break while dealing with my query!! I only hung on because they are such a nightmare to get hold of. Safe to say by the end of the conversation I had cancelled my subscription!"
tracey roberts,2,5,"I just wanted to say a big thanks to one of your customer service staff called Brian Awoto, currently working from home  but is from the Stockport branch. I have been a SKY customer for approx 30 years over 2 addresses and having spoken to Brian on Monday 12th October 2020 it is by far the best customer services I have received ever, not just SKY, he is a credit to your company and just wanted you to know what a fantastic employee you have, he not only sorted my problem with my new SKY Q but was such a lovely person, chatting to me while fixing the problem then when he asked why I hadn’t used my Sky VIP I explained wasn’t sure how to do it he went through everything with me, then sent me one of the gifts in the post. In a time where everyone is quick to complain I wanted to let you know what a great job he has done. Please pass on my thanks to Brian.also just an observation that there are lots of signposts on how to complain but nothing much to praise your staff, I hope this gets back to his line manager.ThanksTracey"
Kim Collins,4,1,Customer service when we signed up direct was second to none - face to face at one of their desks. Since then absolutely farcical. I eventually got through to speak to someone very late at night. Problems for weeks with internet- just sent me another router which wasn't useful at all and since tring to make contact - impossible - no online chat even working. Even when spoke late night I was on the phone for 40 minutes and only 5 spent speakimg to somebody as they went back n forth to ask somebody - and the last time when they went to check they never came back!! Utterly disgraceful
Bonnie,14,5,"Much better than virgin! I grew up with sky and it has just improved over the years. I never have any issues and am always helped when ever I contact their customer service team, unlike their competitors!"
Andy Shield,2,1,"Every few days I receive a call from Sky Technical Help but unfortunately I cannot understand a word they are saying. The calls usually begin with 'hello, hello, are you there Sir' and end abruptly with the phone being put down (by them). During the most recent call, a voice was shouting loudly over a cacophony in their call centre. He kept saying 'Is your computer on, Sir' for an unknown reason. It was - and I was sat at it. After several garbled messages, he hung up, again."
Jake,1,1,Only answer the phone if you want to buy something - useless company
Julie Magnier,1,1,Sky are just appalling. Customer service does not exist yet. Criminal behaviour
Abi  Bowman,2,1,"I was with sky for a few years and then moved house. Due to an error on their side I am being hounded relentlessly for equipment that I sent back and for an account that as far I was concerned, I had closed. Charges are mounting up monthly, I can't get through to a human with any authority and then promised calls back by managers which never happens. I am constantly bombarded with threatening texts and emails and phone calls. DO NOT GO WITH SKY. It's really affecting my mental health and can't seem to get them off my back as I can't get through."
Michael Bethune,3,1,"i have just had broadband and phone installed by sky remotely today,i was with virgin now i have no phone-line no broadband and now have to wait another day for a engineer.  Sky ran checks before installation so the sales person said as he rattled on for about an hour, no problems he said, this was a blatant lie.  You think the engineer who connected me remotely would have had the simple intelligence to check with the customer it was working. then i have to spend hours trying to contact them, OMG following all the instructions on the internet.  You get automated  message to contact a number that takes you right back to  the beginning. i thought virgin was bad but Sky takes the biscuit with its internet and its help. just set up a customer service number that you don't have to search for, really bad service"
Jewel Miah,26,1,Absolute garbage of a company and one to avoid in my opinion. Signed up local community centre to receive SKY. However they sent the wrong engineer... Twice! Even though a couple of days before the second engineer arrived I called them to double check they would be sending the right engineer. I was assured that the correct engineer would arrive. I chased again last week and was told that they would message me an appointment date and time. Nothing materialised. I called back today and spoke to someone called DAN who was very rude and said he couldn't help and I had to call an 0844 number to book in the engineer. When I challenged him why he couldn't just book it in he said it wasn't his Job!! Sorry but I thought you worked for Sky !!!! I made a formal complaint at this stage as he started arguing that it was up to me to call and book in an engineer and not for him to resolve in that particular call. If this wasn't an installation for a community centre I would have cancelled there and then. Unfortunately that decision isn't up to me so I must persevere to get the installation completed.
Gareth,7,1,Poor poor service and a devious approach to making a sale! It has taken me 2yrs to be in a position to cancel my contract I feel was miss sold to me! When I questioned what had been said verbal they told me I should of checked the contract they emailed over and they were not prepared to do anything about it. So after 20yrs of sky TV admittedly I was convinced to stay on several occasions over that period I will not be paying for there service anymore!!!Bad bad company to deal with
Brian F,3,1,"Worst service imaginable. If I had to dream up the worst customer experience possible, it would be better than sky. Avoid at all costs."
Aingeal,1,1,"2+ weeks no phone line, so cant work, complaint e-mails unread. Phone unanswered for days then left on hold 3+ hours, then cut off. Address error impossible to get corrected. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. COMMUNICATION IMPOSSIBLE. Sky shop in Mall cant help either. SO MUCH FOR PRIORITIZING HEALTH WORKERS."
Craig Wickham,1,1,"Absolutely useless service, price is appalling and when you try to cancel you get put on hold for hours.Shocking customer service, spent over 50 minutes on hold waiting for an advisor and then the call cut.Would recommend watching paint dry over giving this crowd another penny"
Trev,14,1,"Today has been a superb. Not that often I’m not a grumpy old moaner. Sky was due this morning to instal the Q system. Just canceled because the engineer has had a positive COVID test. Which is fair enough in the grand scheme of things I suppose. However, what they don’t don’t know is the engineer that was meant to call is friend of mine. It’s wonderful that N Ireland is such a small place. He was rather surprised and concerned to learn that he has had positive COVID test. Especially since he has never been near the test centre or had any of the symptoms. He’s is currently in a customer house fixing a issue.He was informed that he had a few cancellations tho regards positive COVID test and just by pure luck he has been told to now to go to a hotel and repair their system. What a superb happy coincidence. Other  happy coincidence I’m one of the people that canceled the appointment  because I have had a positive COVID test. Which has surprised me, since I have had no symptoms, or a test, and have not spoke with Sky since I arranged the appointment and take a day of work for this appointment. The Jungle drums having been saying that Sky have been doing this rather a lot. Booking appointments with people, engineers then taking sick with the old COVID. Nothing whatsoever with to do with Sky taking on too many appointments and work for the poor engineers knowing full well the appointment they have just made with the happy people at the call can’t be fulfilled and it will be canceled. Nothing to see here. Move on. It’s perfectly fine this because it’s their thing. I’m now waiting for them to get other engineer, that they don’t have, to not call with not today. I love this. Having my time wasted by people that would not know the truth if it fell on them like a grand piano. All is marvellous in my household. That’s until the wife finds out that my time and money has been wasted. She going to running around the walls like Trinity out of the Matrix. I can hardy wait for the inevitable kick to my big fat smiling face. She’s a good women. She will badging me up when she done with me. The only thing I will not be watching Sky on the sofa because the engineer does not have the old COVID. He’s at nice hotel, will probably gets nice cooked breakfast while I try and remove the wife size five Doc Martian from my earhole. Like Tony Tiger says ""I’m Great: "" Thank you Sky xxxxxx"
James Tristram-Smith,5,1,I have had no service since March. 5 cancelled engineer appointments. Over 16hours phone time with numerous promises of management calling me back and NOTHING. Sky customer for 10years and yet treated like absolute crap. There service has taken a serious nosedive over the last couple of years. Literally at a loss with constant disappointments. Use any other service and you’d be better off....
Nicco,5,1,"Absolute shambles***If it wasn’t for the fact you hold the best programmes hostage nobody would have sky. Almost every single cricket match I watch (the only thing I want sky for) we miss vital parts of the action due to appallingly time advert breaks, the video quality on the sky go app is absolutely shameful, and the channel often randomly changes mid game with no warning and you have to hunt through to find where it’s been moved to. Good luck getting hold of anybody at sky"
Dillon O'leary,6,1,I am genuinely shocked that a company THIS BAD and offering such shockingly awful customer services is still profitable and remains in business. The deliberately frustrating and automated service is less than useless and its impossible to actually speak to anyone...ever...unless youre cancelling your account. Even then expect to be on hold for 30 minutes minimum and to provide 31 days notice to quit. What a complete farce- absolutely p@ss poor customer sevice. Truly truly shameful company to deal with.
Paul Day,5,1,"What a nightmare and useless company. Try telling them of an ongoing fault and get sent endlessly around useless sites. No concept of customer service. I do not have a working Sky TV box, I cannot get it fixed, I cannot speak to anyone, they still want their money. How do they stay in business?"
D.Brenton,4,1,"Been with them for many years and feel that they are the new virgin media, VIP never works -been on phone no one knows why and my internet its dropping in speeds very often started on 19.9 meg locked in on router but now its 15-16 meg odd. Stay away from them - there tech support is SHOCKING!!!!!.  bills go up and no reason or being notified - "" believe in better "" stay away only way its better."
Lesley,8,5,I had a wonderful experience with the sky team today a fantastic worker named Yaz who took my call she was fantastic at her job so very helpful and explained everything down to the bills yaz it was a pleasure talking to you great customer service and I'm very happy with your service. Thanks yaz
Charles Wright,7,1,"Engineer never turned up again! No call or e mail. Re booked for a date not acceptable to me. No apologies. Been with them for 30 years , might go with Virgin now."
Katie,1,1,Oh man . Sky are a disaster. Sure the deals sound sweet but I actually feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown from dealing with them . They messed up my contract messed up my broadband . I have no internet yet I've been waiting a month . Still paying full price. Stupid automated answering machine . You'll be on hold for hrs and then when you do get through it's just a different story every time... I'd say I've called over a dozen times in the short month I've been with them some operators are helpful and friendly but no one has their story straight.  Frustrating to say the least.
and Deliver To,2,1,Disgusting customer services. useless telephone answering - recorded messages that don't understand what you're saying. tell you to go to sky.com even after pressing the number to say your internet isn't working. absolute joke. the only way you can speak to someone is by saying you want to cancel your subscription - then you will get put through to an actual person by magic and try and resolve your problem.
Wiviany,1,1,"My connection is always very poor between 12am to 2pm, and it also fails a bit during the day. I've already complained to SKY many times, and tried to do all the steps that was told me to do, and it keeps the same!Connection is not good and it happens while I'm working, it is terrible, and I only have two devices connected!!!!I am tired to complain about this and nothing has been resolved. The only thing they do is to call me and ask me to do some steps, and I always do what they ask to me, but nothing have changed until now!!!!!I am seriously thinking about to change my broadband because it is not fair!I will not accept any calls from SKY anymore unless they send an engineer to my place to definitely fix that!!!"
67777,10,1,Dont go with sky they are a joke please dont waste your money i renewed my contract online as phone lines so busy they did not aply the renewal so charged me out of contract fees. So rang them 30 mins on hold then told i hadnt done it online which i said i had then when i said i wanted the charges removed she hung up on me so sat on hold again for another 30 mins. This is the worst company ever wont be using them ever again. Customer service are rude and useless. I have sky tv phone internet and mobile which i have had for years.
g brown,22,2,"Why would you tell me I don't need an engineer to move from your crap broadband to 'superfast' and then send one? Why isn't one call enough to sort something a 10 year old understands? You're a massive drag all round. No I do not think any other company is better, you all promise speeds and then deliberately cap them. Typical of the lying cheating rip off companies trading in this country. You've got a review for wasting my time, losers"
Matthieu Leger,2,1,"Appalling service. The installation engineer simply never showed up, no heads up or update from Sky. No one in their customers service team can explain why. Now we have to wait another week before to get an update (not an engineer visit, just an update). Expect more than a month to get your Internet services up and running, and that is if you are lucky. Avoid Sky like the plague. 5000 bad reviews can't be wrong, you have been warned."
Jane,3,5,Great customer service from the Glasgow team. Always go above and beyond.
Mark Hughes,3,1,Why do all sky engineers never seem to go to work vans are parked up and never move either too many so called engineers or making that much money out of poor customers
Horizons,3,1,There is no way to delete my online account after having decided to not use Sky anymore
Renata Lemesonoka,1,1,"BIG REGRET. I wish I checked the reviews before I got myself stuck with this provider for three years.. unless you can afford to spend on them over 100£ each months it doesn't allow you to watch anything but pretty much freefew channels , if you want to watch movies series or sports or anything DESCENT , you will need to pay extra for more subscriptions."
Chicken Chaser,1,1,"Why someone would use this company is beyond me now. I've seen a lot of bad customer service in my time (it’s almost expected these days), but the service offered by Sky is absolutely diabolical and the worst I've ever seen. I've wasted hours upon hours to sort out something seemingly simply and have given them plenty of chances to help me. I basically signed up to Sky and was promised a broadband product that they couldn't fulfil on from their side. It took calling up 7 times over the space of 2 days and repeatedly being put on hold for the last person in a long line of disappointments to tell me that Sky don't provide internet in my area whatsoever (which also seems to be nonsense as next door have it!)Throughout these calls, I specifically asked each Sky employee whether they were absolutely sure that Sky could deliver their intended broadband product in my area; each one assured me that there was nothing to worry about and it could be done despite the fact that my order was continually being rejected. I got the impression they couldn't be bothered after a while and just wanted to refer me on so that I would be some other person's problem. All they had to do was check my postcode on their system and they'd know that their service didn't extend to my area. I’ll never consider using Sky again after this experience. What a farce!"
Jon Philbey,2,1,Customer of 19 years. Given terrible customer service staff had no knowledge of what was being said. Now cut off from broadband and phone and will take 14 days to fix! No compensation no nothing...
Andrew Paizes,3,1,Sky is the worst service available and they are impossible to contact. Whatever happens do not use Sky for broadband- any other service would be better. It is slow and fails daily.
Raymond Vale,5,2,Had sky Q installed the thing that they did not tell me it would make my terrestrial TV Ariel redundant. The only way to get tv in aney spear room is to have a mini box put in at a cost of £50.this is the way to treat loyal customers. We have fibre optic installed along the road now just have to wait to see what they are offering. There is bt as well now.
Stephen Luckman,1,1,All sky customers out there and potential new customers BEWARE I added on sky movies to my package logically thinking this would be for the duration of my contract but the discounted offers are for 18 months thereby extending your tv package as well even though your broadband will end on the original date this then has the negative effect that any discounts offered ends and your monthly price goes up extensively This is a dirty trick to keep you on board
Lee Gill,7,1,"Would give 0 stars. Cancelled my subscription after 10 years was told I would need to give 30 days notice, was then billed again after the 30 days and told I would have to wait nearly a month to receive my the bill they shouldn’t have taken back."
Pissed of,1,1,"Had sky 4 years 10 months and since March I have been getting double billed with services suspended more than on yet there issuing 330 pound bills, I ended up in hospital with Covid and sky proceeded to cancel all my services I phoned sky after returning home to be told they wanted 380 pound paid in full, yet my broadband and sky tv were all cancelled at the exchange, during the March lockdown I paid 290 pound that didn’t show up as gone by sky apparently but it did on my online banking, the gentleman n the phone took extensive notes and very adamant I shouldn’t pay it twice however a couple of weeks later my sky again suspended and I had to pay the 290 again, I have spoken to third parties about sky and unfortunately sky are one of the main protagonists of using a pandemic to make more money, many times I asked sky for help due to the pandemic and recieved none, I am now with talk talk paying a fraction of the price, think very carefully before joining sky."
David Toomey,11,1,So my experience moved in to my flat my lovely neiboure has sky and thought I'd get it. So date booked time appointment 7 in morning. I get a knock a the door a 6:30 in the morning ok no probs early to better. Engineer comes in with a child about 13 teen. Said he needs access to roof no probs a call council set it up. Phone engineer no answer call sky they said technician claims I refused wires through my house. And I said that's a lie the called technician whilst I was on phone then he changed his story to it wasn't possible. Although my neighbor's have sky. Shocking
QV,2,1,"Customer Service? There's none. I have appalling broadband coverage in my house after upgrading my package (and monthly fee) but I'm unable to speak to anyone as the automated service continuously sends me to the website, which sadly cannot solve the problem. I'm considering to cancel the whole thing.Disgraceful."
Adam Sharples,8,1,"After recently taking over finances for my elderly mother I noticed her monthly sky bill for basic broadband (not fibre optic, not superfast), phone (rarely used) and TV (entertainment ""value"" package) was £90.£90 a month for the most basic package!  She had been with them for over 4 years and looking back at her previous 4 years of bills, her sky bill had steadily increased from around £30 a month to £90 without any warning or good reason. Skys online user portal allows you to make additions to your package, i.e. spend more money, but there is no way to reduce your bills or change your subscription or cancel your account without calling them. At which point they stick you on hold and essentially barter with you. The old ""let me see what we can do for you"" spiel.  New customers get the same package for under £30, but when you call as a ""loyal and valued"" customer, they offer the same package for £50-60.  Right.Sky has been doing this for years. Cheap offers to get people to sign up and then they proceed to steadily increase their bills without warning.  They have exploited my elderly mother for literally hundreds of pounds.  I have simply switched her to NowTV for around £20 a month with bband and phone. Sky is a sick and corrupt organisation that holds customers to ransom and then encourages them to take unfavourable deals, but only by action of the customer. Had I not stepped in, I believe Sky would continue to increase her monthly bills.  I urge everyone to avoid them."
Pauline Hughes,8,1,"I phoned today to report a sky box not working, no signal,  my tv was OK but not sky, the automated person was saying my phone was wrong which it wasn't, I wanted to speak to a human being but it kept saying to go online, I tried everything but was not given one iota of help. The box eventually started, strangely with a massive advert for sky box Q, which I turned down before as too expensive,  were they trying to get me to get sky Q or am I being cynical. I am reviewing my sky  TV at the moment, as the service is appalling."
Mrs Baller-Ghent,8,1,"Sky's online service is absolutely useless. It just sends you round in circles, page after page after page, with no clear way of dealing with a problem. Why they can't have a simple drop down list that the customer cam activate a concern or request from is beyond me. Calling makes no difference, as wait times are 1 hour plus. If you are going to give the customer the facility of fixing problems, then the facility should be fit for purpose. In this case I would like to activate Talk Shield as Im getting so many nuisance calls. But, in the past I have tried changing packages, fixing broadband issues, and I have never been successful online. Waste of absolute precious time and energy on my part. No effort wasted by Sky, they're just happy to keep taking the ever increasing monthly payments."
Kirandeep,6,4,"Got a great deal on a new package for my parents inc sky sports, telephone and super fast broadband for £60 a month!"
Carole,3,1,"i am very disappointed with my recent experiencing with sky, i have been a customer with them for many years, i lost internet Friday at midday i rang friday afternoon after work, after going through everything online, i was told there was an outage in the area and it would be back up by Saturday, Sunday i still had no internet, rang again to be told i need a engineer visit!! the earliest they can get one to me is 20th october!! explain i have a husband who is clinically vulnerable and therefore spends a lot of tie at home and he s now cut off from the outside world was told there was nothing they could do!! i asked if it would be reflected in my bill i was told no! so £90 a moth for tv and broadband and i cant use broadband or any on demand!! i will be looking a different suppliers!!!"
Tess Turner.,3,2,"I signed up after ssing a deal for £55 a month including tv phone and broadband. Its costing way more than that almost twice as much and yet i can not contact customer support to find out why. Yes we have Covid going on but even so i should be able to queiry my account somehow. There is no online service. Also, i can no longer access some of the mainstream services through sky like catch up on channel 4 and i can not use my Prime account anymore. Our wireless printers (which are brand new) have never worked since we switched & after hundreds of attempts we are now having to buy new printers as the Sky router has no usb so we cant connect them through ethernet. We hate it as a household and wish we had never signed up. Roll on the 18 month contarct we signed up for. Never again."
Andrew McLaren,1,1,"Sky’s customer service is beyond appalling. Have spent over 3 hours on the phone today, spoken to 5 different people and still no closer to sorting the problem.Their website is useless so you’re forced to phone (have tried 3 different numbers). Hope they pay attention to the other reviews on here because for the cost the service is shocking."
Janine Brighouse,8,1,"Over the last 12 months sky as upped my monthly bill to £49.00 for one person, it’s was only in the £30’s even tho sky say they have informed via email of the price increase which I cannot find any emails also never advised out of contract. (I check my emails daily).So last night 3rd October 2020 decided to enough is enough and cancel my sky contract, firstly went on line told call customer services, I  phoned this customer line took FIVE MINUTES  to get to and speak with someone who advised had to call another number 0333 7592787.  So I called this number which I was on hold for ONE HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES! I understand the COVID situation but 1 hour and 20 mins, this says to me they do this on purpose disgusting service ( listening to rubbish computerised music). I have been faithful customer for over twenty years only time I didn’t have sky was when moved home to live with my elderly father who already had sky at his home.So the Lack of communication by sky and leaving people waiting such long length of time and lack of advisory with price increase is a joke to be frankly honest, although the lady who I spoke with seemed nice enough but she had no empathy for the customer and only wanted to see what deals could be done.I Will never return now to sky it’s just take and don’t care about the customer what so ever, now it’s use either freeview for fire stick  works much more cheaper.Update4 days later and still no email from sky advising of end of contract date either inbox or junk/spam folder and checked email address was correctOne last update, day 5 after cancellation of sky they have telephoned me to advise do not cancel direct debit as I still have monies owed to them, I explained I have already paid the difference between now and end of contract was advised still to keep DD in place (I have cancelled DD) also tried to advise if offers as if I would, they have robbed me blind over past year (Richard Turpins of the direct debit world they can take what they want when they want).To cut story short the guy said would resend emails to cancel contract and surprise I have received them, so this makes me wonder we’re is all the other emails advising of payment increases, so this proves they never sent any emails to advise of anything to me as they do have my correct address and these never landed in my spam folder or any other folder. So does make me think they do what they want don’t care even at the cost of customer who ended up paying overdraft charges cause of sky price increases that was never advised off"
Jacob Hardy,1,1,Website is terrible. No option to create SkyID or even troubleshoot a forgotten SkyID password/email. Tried for over an hour now.When I try calling it asks for a different phone number that maybe used for a different account.. I DONT HAVE AN ACCOUNT. Website lay out is ****.. Looks like im going to stick with Virgin or try BT.
Rob,5,1,"Tried the Sky Sports offer for £18 per month with an option to cancel at any time. Upgrading to this package was easy and could be done online. However when you try and remove this from your package there is no option to do this online. You have to phone and are charged at a local rate. I have tried 3 times but was in a que for over 30 minutes twice and then 1 hour 10 mins on the the third only to be told I had been put through to the upgrade department. They couldn’t deal with the cancellation and refused to do it saying they could only do upgrades. I then asked for them to put me through to the right department - can’t do that saying I would have to start again using exactly the same number!!!! I demanded to speak to the operators supervisor where the operator said they wouldn’t be able to do anything. I kept asking to be put through and wouldn’t let him end the call, surprise surprise he put me on hold and then it went silent. I phoned again and waited over 30 minutes until it was finally dealt with. The operator kept asking why I was cancelling and I explained that the majority of Liverpool’s fixtures were on a Saturday at 3pm and with them being knocked out of the Carabao Cup there was no point. He tried to argue that these fixtures could be moved and to cancel would risk the offer coming off in the future. I replied I would take the risk and Sky are advertising the offer as a dip in and out at your wish with no commitment. Why you can’t simply remove the package online is beyond me - it couldn’t be Sky trying to make it as hard as possible to cancel could it? Absolute dire customer service. If they want to use Covid restrictions as an excuse then make it easier to upgrade/ downgrade your package online!!!!!"
Glen,4,1,"Note: I only gave one star as there was no option to give no starsWe are in the middle of moving house therefore on our third time in 18 years as a sky customer and I have never experienced such terrible customer service as we have during this installation. I am in the utility industry myself and I would be disgraced if we provide a similar service to which me and my partner have experienced with sky.Day of install - sky engineer turns up and he’s first words were how many other jobs he has that day. I wanted to discuss our options on the best place to run the wire as my other property just have it thrown over the roof and had bugged me ever since. I just the impression he just want to give me the easiest way for him not the best way for us. A route was agreed but then he done such a terrible job and it was nothing like we discussed. When my partner told him she wasn’t happy with it he said “well it’s done now, I’m not doing it again”. The engineer was at our house for approx 2 hours - which sky said that was longer than a engineer would normally be. I’m sorry but for sky to only give us 2 hours of their engineers time after 18 years service to carry out work on our property is disgraceful.Further to that - BT open reach didn’t turn up that day either after us waiting in all day for them. Sky couldn’t comment on why they didn’t turn up as BT didn’t make them aware.Sooo.....it was arranged that a engineer would come back today and make good what the last engineer done for today’s engineer to just post a missed you card in our letter box and walk off (seen on our Ring Door bell). It was clear people were in as I had 6 different contractors working at the property and front door wide open.When speaking to the customer centre they are limited to help as they keep claiming to be working from home due to COVID, which I also need to work from home but are unable to with my internet connection putting me at risk having to travel to the office to carry out my work.There is a nice tidy virgin cable already in the property. I really don’t know why we are still trying to stay loyal to sky after all this experience. I have requested to speak to a area manager or someone from an engineering background as I have a few question/observations but still have yet to receive a call.i have a formal complaint raised and it will not be getting closed until someone of authority calls me.Looking at the amount of bad reviews on here sky clearly do not put customer at the fore front and OFCOM should be ashamed they are not doing something about this to penalise them."
Liz Cogley,20,1,"Absolutely fuming with sky. Waited in all day for the engineer. Got a call from the sky office at 430pm to tell me that the engineer couldn't find my house. Engineer was supposed to phone me to let me know what time he expected to arrive, no phone call. Now rescheduled for October 20th. I have lived in my house for twenty seven years and everyone can find it. Not a happy customer."
michael roberts,5,1,Absolutely shocking. On hold for an hour and still couldn't get through. Looking at the other reviews it's absolutely appalling!
stez,5,1,"Following storms in Norfolk on 25th September, all power was lost in numerous areas. My 82 year old auntie, who lives alone and who has limited mobility is still without her phoneline, Sky have not reinstated it, whilst nearby neighbours on BT have had theirs reinstated. She is a loyal Sky customer, also with a number of other sky services and yet is being treated really poorly by them.   Please resolve ASAP"
London Brown,9,1,"Not even 1 star from me. I'm cancelling my DD right now for my sky TV, broadband and phones, I think everyone should do the same, they will soon listen!  20 mins waiting for a gap of someone to talk to! Watch this space, once Furlough finishes they will soon get their staff back. Boris and China business move, what have you done??? All any one wants is what they pay for, and at the moment it is diabolical with all providers- looks like a lot losing their jobs if we all cancel our DDs !!!"
Matt,7,1,Using covid as an excuse not to answer calls only prioritising vunerable customers im glad I left these clowns Zen Internet is 100% better
Rebeka,9,1,"I have been at Sky for 4 years. I am moving house and it's impossible to contact Sky. I tried the online chat, but even to find that option it took me a long and hard look at the website. They're prioritizing vulnerable customers they say on the phone, but what about all the rest of us?? We are paying customers too. The phone line simply just cut off after about 3 minutes waiting on the line. I have decided to leave the whole thing and just cancel everything with this company. Customer service is non existent. To even cancel my contract, that will be a pain, not mentioning to arrange it to be moved to my new address. I am very disappointed. Two days ago I have waited to be able to speak with someone online for 2!!!! hours long. When I finally got there it turned out that there was a temporary error on their side so the guy I spoke to was unable to arrange my contract to be moved. He suggested to try the online chat the next day, too bad that I couldn't join in the queue for that chat either yesterday nor today so far. It says it's busy, so it doesn't give you the option to even be put on the waiting line. Someone tell me how on earth will I be able to sort this out????? Shame on you Sky!!"
Robert Reynolds,17,1,Really poor customer contact centre process!
Jake Freeman,1,1,Less then one star I really should put as we have been with them for a month and the internet has been so bad we have started using the hot spot on our phones instead as it’s more reliable and less glitchy.I would never recommend them to anyone.
John Downham,1,1,"Im single ,and covid has knocked my finances down,so called sky to downgrade my tv package to help.,but they were not interested.I wanted to remove sky cinema as not using it much and was told i would be charged my remaining contract if i cancelled it.Sky for me now isnt cost effective with repeats galore especially at the weekend,and them losing disney+ and nat geo,and nat geo wild and because their not flexible anymore,when my contract ends in february ,im going to cancel all my tv package,then go to freeview and get disney+ which i can have when i want,and use other streaming services,at a fraction of the cost.Sky is not flexible and its not good value for money on its tv anymore,and im sure many people will cancel once their contrcts are up.sky Q may be a good box but its not worth it anymore,and theirs little incentive to keep it anymore."
Alexis  Woods,5,1,Sky are useless cant get through for any Broadband technical support and cant log a ticket. Broadband keeps dropping out intermittently with no rhyme or reason I cant work and Its dropping while I am trying to complete online assessments which is causing me to fail. So I phone and no answer and you cant even raise a ticket or email them to ask them to raise a ticket. I have now written to the CEO pretty sure they have altered my MSR which is causing it to fail but cant speak to anyone.
steve davies,1,1,I am try to down size and it is absolutely impossible. So cancelled DD to try and get attention. never again.
Aaron Chapman,1,1,"Awful. I have never experienced a worse service. Moved to a new house in London and booked a house move for the day after I arrived. First engineer comes and after playing with his ladders comes back to say he can’t install it as his ladder isn’t big enough - rings his colleagues. Second engineer comes end of the day and has exactly the same problem. Was promised that an hour after he left I would receive a call from sky to book in for the special team to come and Install with larger ladders. Heard nothing. Rung myself the following day - mid September, to hear the earliest available slot is November 9th. This is a joke. All whilst I’m still paying for my complete sky package of 120£ per month. No compensation or resolution can be made until this installation has been carried out - therefore I’ll be 240£ out of pocket for a service I don’t even have access to currently, not to mention the inconvenience of having 3 engineer visits to install. Will be taking to court when able to."
Kate,3,1,Just cant get through at all unless I’m vulnerable/at risk absolute joke.I understand they need to prioritise but the service is awful and you can only blame so much on Covid. I need efficient internet connection and it keeps dropping out causing my computers to cut off in middle of emails banking etc!! Trying to work from home. Ring up you get a message asking you what your problem is on the phone but they never understand so they send you a text message link to what they think you want!!! So frustrated. I just want to speak to someone as to why this is happening!!
Rich,8,1,"Absolute con job. Ordered Sky TV & Broadband and when the engineer came out to fit the dish we discovered we couldn't get the TV so we cancelled the entire package and moved providers. We're still periodically receiving bills from Sky for more and more money even after cancellation. Try and call them to discuss the bill and the automated phone line says before we can be put through we have to settle our account! No Live Chat, a useless Online Guide and no response on Facebook chat for 48 hours. We literally can't get hold of a single person at Sky to sort this mess out and they are sending more and more threatening emails about debt collectors. They can blame Covid all they want for this appalling customer service, but I imagine they are always like this. AVOID.UPDATE 23/11/2020 - So they have now referred me to a debt collector. Completely ignored a letter of complaint I sent to them and I have been stuck on hold for over 45 minutes 3 times now trying to just make a payment to stop the debt collectors coming around. SKY are SCUM."
Majella Brennan O'Neill,1,4,My review is more about someone who works in the customer service dept. I rang sky ireland today to cancel my subscription after 14 year of service. I discover Disney channel was removed for it. When I rang I spoke to a very friendly guy called Lee. He understood my upsetting issue and could not do enough for me on the phone. He went through all my options as I have a multi room in daughters bedroom. He is the reason sky is not losing another customer. My payment is now reduced by 25 euros and I am getting a sky Q in next week. Sky if all your customer service team was like Lee I don't think you would be losing as many customers. Thank you Lee.
P.B,20,1,"I upgraded from Sky Broadband Essentials to Sky Broadband Superfast. The only thing Superfast was the money taken from my account. Sky have stated the guaranteed speed of 62mb/s is being delivered to my property, however they cannot and will not help with why their own Sky Router cannot distribute the speed in a New Build Home where the walls are paper thin. Their tactic is basically we only care and will appoint an engineer if you purchase Sky Boost for an extra £6 a month. Once again Sky has shown its worth at being a bunch of lying thieving scum to tie you down to a 18month contract. The worst thing is they arent even regulated apart from a crappy version of the Financial Ombudsman Service. Who dont do sod all. Going forward better off using broadband from your mobile supplier and pay for Netflix. Get rid of Sky and the BBC with their awful scam of a television licence."
Consumer,1,1,"Absolutely the WORST! I haven’t even had this a month & I can’t even watch a show without several interruptions. It’s ridiculous. And I get put on hold repeatedly when I call, if someone even answers. The people who do answer are NOT helpful; seem to have no idea how to help."
Lisa,2,1,SKY! YOUR SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WATCH ONE FULL 30 mins programme WITHOUT THE CONNECTION BEING LOST- THE SCREEN IS ALWAYS BLUE AND SAYS: YOU CANNOT WATCH TV RIGHT NOW.I AM SICK OF YOUR STAFF WHO NEVER COMINICATE - WASTING HOURS OF MY TIME - COMING OVER TO 'fix' THE ISSUE YET 7 MONTHS LATER I STILL CANNOT WATCH TV WITHOUT IT GLITCHING OUT. I HAVE GIVEN UP ON SKY AND NOW I WILL TELL EVERYONE WHO I KNOW - NOT TO GO FOR SKY- BUT TO GO FOR VIRGIN MEDIA AS THEIR BROADBAND AND TV PACKAGES ARE FAR FAR BETTER THAN YOUR PRODUCTS SERVICES AND YOUR CUSTOMER CARE/or lack of.
Robert Phillips,2,1,STAY AWAY...From these thieving rats...they think my bank account is a money pit for them...appalling customer service...45 minutes for someone to answer my call then only spoke to them for 3 minutes the guys attitude was very arrogant and un helpful...time to pull the plug on this waste of space company.
Sandra Reid,3,1,"No stars would be more suitable.I’ve been a customer of sky for many years , every other month they increase your bill by £2 thinking that you won’t notice it .Now they have removed the Disney channel completely and haven’t reduce the price of my bill.When I called about it the customer service operator was extremely rude .There’s no way to complain as you have to write a writing letter not even a email . I call to try to complain and the said the complaint will be  internally so I won’t get a feed back .I don’t think that right as you should know if they actually took your complaint seriously.Sky is a joke and I will be cancelling with them ."
customer,3,1,"Awful. Couldn’t understand what the “advisor” was saying, waited 2 hours to be told there was nothing they could do.  DO NOT SUBSCRIBE."
jessica young,2,5,"I spoke to a wonderful man called alex, as i wanted to purchase sky in my name, i really would love to leave him the best feedback in the world, he was so clear with everything he was telling me, so patient with me asking the same questions over and over and we even had a good laugh on the phone really did feel like i was talking to a friend. I really hope alex can see this somehow. He gave me discounts and freebies that i didnt even expect, wonderful man and amazing at his job! He deserves this recognition as he has set the bar high for sky for me.  I have spoken to other asvisers from sky, yes they were good but no where on his level, Alex should train all the staff to work like him! If you can see this Alex, thank you so much!!"
paul Sturdy,2,1,"I cannot believe how this company is still operating  the only service you can speak to is `pay my bill""  they are the worst avoid at all cost, they take double payments and don't resolve your problem, my equipment is going in the bin"
Clare Taylor,4,5,"After 22 years of being a sky customer I had reached a point of being completely fed up with my package this year however after speaking to Luigiano in the retentions department it completely changed my mind he was nothing but helpful, a pleasure to speak to and he’s a credit to the company. Thank you again for such a pleasant experience!"
Ixottic,1,1,"Absolutely terribleWe have been with em for months and every day the TV signals lost internet's going of on our phones all the time n lag 247 in games we phoned em up 3 times n there only excuse is ""there's a problem in the area"" so terrible  should of stayed with Virgin"
Vicky,4,1,"I dont even know where to start! moved to new place a month ago. Tried to get vodfone - after two weeks waiting for modem gave up, cancel it called sky. Lovely guy told me its all good they can connect Internet no problem with my address, paid €50 fee for conection, they send me modem next day happy days. Getting email after a day saying something wrong with my line i need to give them a call. After waiting on the line 50min (bear in mind they have the stupidest auto mashine and its very hard to get to talk with the agent) they told me my line is broken they sending technician. Got an appointment after 5 days, nice man came, fixed it, told me to call sky again and let them know its fixed now. After another 50 min waiting some agen answer the phone, he had no clue whats going on, told me that i will have internet in 24 hours now, for some reason my deal from €30 per month went up to €47, when asked why he said i m paying for the landlines(I DONT HAVE ANY LANDLINE, I ONLY NEED INTERNET FOR MY NETFLIX!!!). At that stage i gave up and said whatever, he asked are u okay to sign contract, i told him i already did a week ago! When hang up the phone i got 3 emails, one confirming i m gonna pay more for the service, second that they sending me modem (AGAIN!!!) and third one - congratulations - you will have internet on the 12 of october 😁 in another 2 weeks at that stage. I nearly got heart attack called them again... 50 min waiting again some nice guy answered he was helpful (finally someone) told me that previous guy shouldnt be charging me more as my package was €30 from day one. Anyway, with tears in my eyes i asked - when i m going to have internet (it was Thursday evening) he said definetly wednesday(after talking with someone while i was on hold) but could be Monday or Tuesday. Guess what... I m back from work today, its wednesday and no freaking internet. Tried to ring that auto mashine keep giving me options but no option to speak with someone, eventually said evetything is closed - call tomorrow. Bear in mind i paid €50 for conection, and on my app saying they will charge me €30 for the first month on the first of October which is tomorrow.... For what?!"
mrpete,1,1,"Sky is an absolute joke, I moved house 6 weeks ago and have been waiting for broadband to be installed bearing in mind I had sky at my previous address. They said there was an order/block on the new address as the previous owner had not cancelled their Internet. Fair enough I wait a month for the order to be lifted and now I keep getting booked in for installation and then cancelled by text/email 24-48 later. I've been on the phone 7 separate times for a total of 12 hours getting passed around usually 5-6 different people saying they're not the right person. Well that's it Sky you've had my business for 15 years and now I'm going to a rival. I suggest anyone who is with Sky changes when they can as eventually they will let you down regardless of how loyal you have been."
Usman,1,5,Really please with the service received by Ryan was explained things very well and quick and gave me a great deal really happy
carole,1,1,"I was mis sold a mobile contract, I contacted sky they said they would be in touch within 72 hours, they didn't,  i have been with sky for many years but when my contracts are up I am going elsewhere, beware they sell you contracts then charge you more"
Karen Edwards,8,5,"Fabulous service received from Adien Q from Uddingstone Dept today. So much so, that I have changed my decision to pull all family accounts from Sky and change supply - he managed to sell me the value of Sky and look at what was best for ME ....... and in doing so, retain all accounts.He is a credit to Sky - This is what customer service should look like."
Colleen Williams,5,1,"I feel very disappointed with the service I have received, I cannot receive incoming calls on the landline which was installed on15/9/2020, 3 BT Openreach engineers have been in to check, the line is fine but they are now saying I may have to wait another week for SKY to release the number at their end. My husband is disabled and partially sighted and we need the landline due to this. I wish I could cancel my contract. I feel I have been patient but am no further forward with my issue and no compensation offered until my issue has been sorted."
Matt Glazer,3,1,"Twice an engineer has been booked in for broadband, and twice they haven't turned up. Been waiting two weeks for sky to update me on why this cannot be booked properly.Spoken to probably 6/7 different people, all as unhelpful as eachother.Pathetic."
Debbie,6,1,"Absolute con they have tried to invoice me an amount £17 for no reason and sent to a debt company. they are chasing, sky has not comunicated with me for 8 months"
neil weeks,2,1,"Amazon is coming Sky, be very afraid."
Phil Johnson,22,1,
Adam Worrall,16,1,"I purchased sky broadband and never received the router, it appears it was lost somewhere between sky sending it to the Royal Mail. I called sky who were unhelpful and told me they could not issue a replacement until Royal Mail returned the missing router, I’m still being charged for a service I’m not getting and sky are not bothered about replacing the router, tried to cancel and was told I couldn’t even though I’m within my cooling off period."
Michelle B,1,3,
Jodie Louiise Parkinson,1,1,"I have been with sky for years always had a pretty good service and been happy with there service. But over the past year I would say I have had nothing but terrible Internet service/ connection. I have called them a number of times for it to be fixed or looked at and I just kept getting fobbed off with things to do and try and nothing working. They ran tests there end which show i am getting good Internet connection, yes I might be at the time u check but the constant drop in Internet every day is terrible and your not going to see unless you watch my internet for like a solid 24 hours. So today I called to cancel my service to move else where which I have every right to do, but was told I couldn't cancel due to i haven't had an technical person out to look at my internet. Well to be honest the amount of calls I've made and never even been offered that, but then when I want to cancel you use ur poor service as a supplier to stop me cancelling how is that legal!!! You shouldn be able to cancel any sort of contract when every you wish. Well i have requested to speak to a manager and if i don't get this resolved I will be taking this further."
Jud Hemmings,1,1,"Customer service adviser was extremely argumentative and rude!!!! I hope I never have to deal with customer services again. Dreadful treatment of paying customers. I only gave one star because I had to, in my opinion I would give them minus five stars"
Katan Naik,27,1,40 mins hold past from 3 different advisors and then cut off.sky must have the worst after sales of any company
Stuart Turnbull,1,1,Don’t go near this company I’m on the phone trying to get through to cancellation (tv) due to redundancy Friday 25th 55 min then told wrong department Saturday 26th 1 hour 20 had to give up Monday 28th 3x 50 mins got through twice and asked why I wanted to cancel when I explained due to redundancy I was told he couldn’t do cancellation Something going on at sky regarding this issue
Chaitanya Bhure,1,1,"Pathetic service provider, they charge you anything out of anywhere with no satisfying reasons. My bill went up to 26.71 / Month from 18/Month with reason that my 18 months contract has been ended. Next month it went to 33 with reason discounts were ended partly. Seriously ? Ridiculous"
Stan Walker,1,1,I have been with sky for over 20 years and my super fast broadband which is actually super slow is horrific. I have tried multiple times to get through to a human being and I keep getting a sms with a link to help but it doesn’t solve my problem. I can’t seem to get through to anyone so I turned this around and pretended I wanted to buy something .... I was answered in seconds by a human being.... it’s a shame you don’t support your customers once you get them. As for getting a telephone number for services to help that is actually manned I think finding red rum would be easier. Very very poor service
A Ash,22,1,"they used to be amazing,looking after customers,great service etcBut wow, they have gone downhilll big timeCustomer service is a joke,they secetly upgrade your account to a higher price then come out with some BS that they cant prove, they only budged when i threatened legal action...Now to actual sky tv ...Im a huge sports fan ...i really dont know what is going on... every show on the sports now seems to be aimed at school kids, from thst big fat mess known as chunkz on satirday mornings the new crappy panel they now have on socxer saturday oh not forgetting axeing all the cricket legends...Soccer Am already seems to have less airtime than a tv advertisement...its going well sky...really well?Ive requested cancellation for november and hopefully il be free of this , now crap tvIf sky dont pull their finger out bt will take over with more of their own content"
Maya,1,1,"Do not deserve any stars but that is not an option. Yesterday, I spoke to the first customer services representative who made me feel extremely uncomfortable as he kept referring to me as ""love"" and ""darling"". I disconnected the call. The second time I tried to explain to the woman, I was calling because the parental control on my child’s mobile sim was not blocking 18+ content. She chose to not listen to me or understand the issue and kept telling me the problem was not with the mobile SIM as the parental control was on and it was a broadband issue when I assured her it was not and could not be as the broadband was not in use and even when it is, the shield works fine. She told me SKY had no responsibility to protect my child from online 18+ content! The broadband advisor confirmed it was not a broadband issue when I was transferred to him.The woman I spoke to today admitted there was an issue on some of SKY’s mobile SIMS and they had been aware of it for a few weeks now and enabled me to cancel my contract! Why have SKY not contacted their customers and told them to check their children’s SIMS and made them aware of the issue?"
Gary Potts,1,1,"Absolutely shocking.....had a appointment with Sky engineer booked for Sunday as Sky tv was not working......Saturday lunchtime it came back on so i tried to give Sky a courtesy call to tell them it was working to save the engineer a visit, i was told i could not cancel online and given a phone number to ring....on ringing the number all i got was an automated message that wanted to send me an sms with a link to the page i needed which i already had.....suppose now the engineer will have a wasted journey......at least i tried......."
Paul,16,1,Seem to believe that they can just double subscription service cost (TV) without any notification - the monopoly these guys have is disgusting and needs breaking up.
Bobby,2,1,The most useless service I've experienced in my life. Constantly bounced around from person to person who can't help with a simple move of address. Obviously put through to people who have little to no experience.Been on the phone for 56 minutes now and still nobody has been able to help.A simple matter made so difficult. Avoid Sky if you can.
Roy houston,37,1,"3 months we have been with Sky with broadband and phone I can honestly say it’s been horrendous! I have been left with out a land line and broadband keeps failing, I have medically fragile immediate family who need to contact me 24/7 and now can’t sky offered us £3 tesco gift card which I found insulting, bt engineer came out and said everything’s fine it’s prob the hub, Sky Now have said it’s the line so I can’t win I have been with out telephone line and broadband for last 2 weeks on and off, we cancelled sky today and asked about a refund on our bill and they OFFERED US A FREE MOVIE 😂 we can’t watch a movie because the broadband keeps crashing, I shall be doing a written complaint I want a refund for money’s paid and I’ll take Sky to court if need be, I seriously would avoid Sky in the future they use to be fantastic but not any more customer service has gone right down hill you can’t blame everything on covid!!!!"
Mark Smith,16,5,Been with Sky for quite a long time and never had any issues. Their new SkyQ is amazing and the ability to multi-room now at no extra cost is a welcomed gift!Thanks Sky - keep it up (except the pricing) :)Mark
Stu Evans,12,1,I can't offer any more words of advice other than don't go there. They are just full of little supprises. The equipment is average. The broadband is dire and router has less functionality than my fridge. Everything is a bolt on. What I was sold and what I get are different. Hidden in an navigation nightmare website. Customer service always leads you to picking up the phone. Great if its broken. Honestly I can't get past the monopoly and way they actually despise you as a money pit. Don't believe me. Its the white elephant in the room. When I switched everyone I spoke to said something negative. Huge hidden costs in the first months. They actually charge you a management fee to keep service standards. They don't care just shut up and pay your money. I'd leave but mysteriously I have another 6 months bolted on to what I signed up for.
kevin fowlds,3,1,I have just got a letter to say that sky are charging for me to get a paper bill.These people are already thieves.I will be pulling the plug on my subscription as from the day they start charging me.They are so full of crap saying that its for the enviornment.All its for is for them to make more money and rip us off more.I havent got a reliable internet to get and pay any accounts onlone so I get penalized.I no its not much money but its the principle.
Me,1,1,"Absolutely shocking level of customer service and aftercare for such a large company - although it’s hard to verify that, given nobody ever answers the phone (the number for which you’ll be very lucky to find given how hard sky try to keep it a secret). Avoid at all costs."
Kerry D,1,1,"Sky are charging me for £132 of phone calls that I have not made. I reported the issue and Sky sent an Broadband engineer out 4 days later who said he wasn’t a telecommunications engineer, and did not check properly. After hours worth of phone calls and stress a month later Sky say I have to pay. I also believe a breach of confidentiality as I have an itemised bill of some else’s phone calls. I have managed to find out who this person was, her account was suspended at the same time of mine due to non payment of her bill. Every time she rang out my phone number came up. Sky refuse to link both these issues and still want £132 from me.... unbelievable. I have been a long term customer of over 10 years and never used my home phone. I will leave Sky and never use their service again."
Lydia,1,5,"Have spoken to three people now at Sky due to my home move (as the seller of the property I'm moving into mistakenly cancelled my order), all have been extremely polite and helpful and have got me back on track. Regarding the home move team, they are available to call over weekends and in the evening (I think 8.30am - 8pm) so if you call at 7pm you can get through very quickly, as I just did. Hopefully the Broadband is as good as the Customer Service!"
Robert,2,1,My goodness do they ever answer the phone. I do think some companies are hiding behind Covid as an excuse to give appalling customer service.
Kirstie Lawton,1,1,"Don’t use this server. The online automated system is appalling. When you do finally get through to someone, you’re highly unlikely to get any help, only someone trying to up sell. I can’t wait until my contract ends, so much so that I’m likely to just break contract and return to BT"
Graeme Beddows,4,1,"81% bad reviews!!!! Thats just appalling. You would think they'd want to rectify that but they make so much money ripping customers off they couldn't care less. I have a router to return but can i get through to them to request a returns package? Not a chance, so apparently I'm going to get charged £30 for not returning it. I just keep getting a text message saying 'go online' to sort out signal problems for a service i no longer have and there's nothing there to request a returns package. Worst company in the world yet the authorities do nothing. Never using sky again which seems to be a growing trend."
luke banks,11,1,"Called sky for my elderly neighbours , there 80 plus Because there contracted had ended sky hit them up with full bills and didn’t inform them . Elderly couple have being paying 80 a month for 2mb internet and basic sky package !! Absolutely sickening behaviour from sky"
FlewFN,1,1,really bad wifi 200 ping with packet loss worst customer service.i cant even watch a youtube vid without it being on 360p quality.
Garry Errill,19,1,"Sky TV, shocking customer service."
Nathan Davies,11,5,"I was struggling to pay a bill due to lost my job , the lady on phone restructured my payments and helped me keep the cartoon channels for my daughter, She went above and beyond for me very thankful it’s been 8 months now sky is on every morning and evening for my daughter Thanks"
Gwen Sandra Towse,3,1,Sky Q.   If you have more than one tv in your house and you get skyQ then when they install it the other tv will not get normal channels as sky disconnect your house aerial from your tv and there is no aerial socket in the sky Q box so they charge you to fit special box so you can get digi channel on other Tv or what they really want you to do is pay for multiroom sky.  So not worth changing to skyQ
Hannah Lou Carney,6,5,"I want to thank sky for coming out during the pandemic to fix my wifi fault. I want to thank the hard working engineers who came out, and risked their health for me. Without you guys I would have lost my job and wouldn't be able to work remotely. Thank you sky I am very grateful!"
Garry Frost,32,1,"Just tried to watch a program on my5 to be told I don't have the subscription to watch this program...... really, I don't have the subscription to watch a free service from channel 5?! Ok, so I switched my TV over to Freeview and watched it on there for nothing! After this it's made me think I could do without the sky movies and sky entertainment and just switch to Freeview! It would save me a fortune paying for most things I can actually watch for free on Freeview!"
Michael Nolte,1,1,"Had Sky for a year. Seems that I did not really knew what I ordered because when browsing their program I was told that I do not have access to most of the stuff on there. Plus, I received Sky using Telekom and it is impossible to switch to English language audio in there, without using a secret invisible menu that you can find using google. That kind of made the service useless for me. I then tried to order additional packages online which did not work. I clicked on order, the page told me that it was ordered, but nothing happened.I made an half-hearted attempt to call them but was hanging on the phone for too long without speaking to a living person that I got fed up.Finally, I lost my pin. I then wrote e-mails to various addresses and send SkyTV a facebook message. No reaction, no way to access Sky anymore. The only way to get in touch with this company, I thought, is through registered mail. That is how I cancelled my subscription.Since then I have been bombarded with stupid e-mails about program highlights and stuff that were rather annoying because none of them were actually available to me."
Graham Owens,25,1,Can't get hold of anyone at Sky.  Whgat a pathetic service they offer.  Perhaps they are so big they dont actually care.Joke company
Rayhan Rafiqul,1,1,"The worst company I have ever seen, bad customer service, it is borderline impossible to speak with someone that is from sky and now during lookdown the are saying that ""They are prioritising people with health conditions"" LIES, their service is so bad that so many people complain and they are trying to hide their own incompetence. They have promised me a minimum guaranteed of 60 mb/s and the best I get is 10 mb/s with an average daily speed of 3 mb/s. This had been going for MONTHS now, MONTHS, I try to contact them and they keep on telling me that according to their website the speed is  as it should be, LIES, these guys are borderline scammers with the worst, I repeat THE WORST customer service and internet service in the market. I have never written any review in anything, I can not be bothered , but I am writing this because that is how much I hate this company. I went to Bangladesh last year and even though Bangladesh have trouble having electricity, Bangladeshi internet is faster than sky, and I believe I said enough.If you think to have an sky internet connection, do not do it, these guys are borderline scammers go to other companies who are more serious and proactively tries to give a good service to their customers. I have never, I repeat never written any review and I hate to criticise, but I have made an exception because that is how much I hate sky."
Darshita Ashar,2,1,Still waiting for them to call me after made an official complaint!!!! No one seems to be bothered!!
Emma,13,1,"So hard to get hold of them, a series of questions and online questions before we even get a number. I just wanted to speak to someone! then it was a huge wait"
Ash,5,1,"My elderly parents were somehow convinced by a Sky sales rep that Sky offers a better service and a similar package compared to the previous provider. They had sky installed but the broadband installation was done quite poorly and just to the front room of the house. Of course the computer is much further away so we had to wait for a signal repeater. Anyhow, they could make do but found that the broadband speeds were very slow. The average speeds measured were between 2Mbps and 2.5Mbps (compared to an average of 80-90 Mbps they were getting previously). Now to explain, 2Mbps is not even good enough to play some app games on your phone. We called Sky customer service to enquire and after waiting for and hour on the line we were told that they couldn’t and wouldn’t do anything as the Sky contract states the minimum speed to expect is 2.5Mbps and in their calculations the speed was averaging 2.5Mbps!! Basically saying, tough luck.They were clearly taking advantage of my parent’s old age and got them to switch. When I complained I was told that my parents should have had someone who understood the contract be there when they signed up, indicating it was MY fault that I didn’t help. At no point we’re they told that they would suffer a deterioration in service by switching. It’s all “like-for-like, but marginally cheaper”. This is atrocious customer service.The only solution offered was for us to pay MORE to upgrade to a minimum of 20Mbps. Again remember they were getting 80Mbps with a previous provider. We are now stuck and unable to cancel for the duration of the contract due to the rubbish “contract” that they have signed. Stay away from Sky. They do anything to get you signed up to unfair contracts and sit there grinning while you complain, as you were dumb enough to fall for their marketing and sales pitches."
Peter jones,3,1,"I recently made an online order to have my broadband switched over to sky, after being recommended by my neighbour... there is no such thing as customer service and helpline from sky, their website offers no assistance whatsoever because it doesn't exist. no idea when the engineer is supposed to turn up and check all the lines..  left completely in the dark... God help them if this is the way they treat their customers... I will be cancelling before my cooling off period expires for sure.."
Zoltan Lipp,6,1,"Sky have a very unfair policy in terms of ending your contract: even if your contract expires in a given date you need to give them 31 days notice... but if you end your subscription before your contract is over you need to pay a penalty.Also finding out details about your contract is very difficult, on your account homepage it is not clearly stated what exactly is in your contact when it is expiring, etc..."
Fred,25,1,Have cancelled sky sports had enough of helping to fund their political activist agenda and constant race baiting Just want to watch a game of football they also sacked the Gillette soccer Saturday team great entertainment and replaced them with cardboard cut outs like watching paint dry feel sorry for Geoff must be on anti depressants to get him through
Liz Fitzsimons,1,1,My neighbour had sky installed yesterday we share the satelite dish. sky's technician cut our wires now we have no t.v. after spending HOURS trying to get through was told we would have to pay 60 euros for an engineer to come out to reconnect us. I said no way was I paying for their mistake then said our neighbour would have to ring them to come out. that would take 5 days before they could come out. I threatened to go to another provider and she said o.k. will I put you through to disconnection. This is how much they value their customers. the worst company I have ever dealt with. Don't go near them.
Peter,17,1,Cancelled sky broadband 2-4 mbs not fit for purpose would not run sky q boxes. They then charged me £50 early settlement fee as in mid contract.Not fit for purpose Sky rubbish broadband.
john lowther,3,1,Cancelled my sky package but they continued to take money from my account.Stopped the direct debit they phoned saying I cancelled the broadband not the television package now being passed to debt collection agency.If I could give them a lower rating I would they are useless.i think they purposefully hire people that can’t do there job
PJ,2,5,"Spoke to Emma in Glasgow and she was a true professional, very helpful and went over and beyond to resolve all my queries.I am very impressed with her knowledge and professionalism and she needs to be acknowledged!"
Will Hogg,5,1,"Our Sky equipment was installed in December 2019, Sky contract BT Openreach to install the phone line...The BT Openreach engineer knocked over my perimeter wall.I was instructed to arrange the repair and claim back the costs (agreed via email with BT Openreach law firm).I receive no further correspondence from BT Openreach law firm and Sky take no responsibility for the contractor.Sky complaints department are useless!!!I will be seeking legal advice and taking the appropriate action.Update: after threatening legal action Sky upgraded my complaint to a manager who called me...and a day later I received contact from the Openreach legal team.The repair was paid for two weeks later!My review remains, as a customer should not be expected to be put in this position."
Michelle Golding,1,5,My Sky Phone technician Stoyan (Sam) was very helpful in organising for a engineer to come out to fix my broadband technicality today.He was friendly and explained everything to me so it was straightforward. A pleasure to talk to.... Thanks Stoyan and thank you Sky
Phillip Griffiths,6,5,Switched from BT tv to Sky tv. BT tv box is slow and sluggish compared to Sky Q and had a deal off Sky for entertainment pack cinema sky sports bt sport and multiroom box all for £54 a month for 18 months 🙂
Jules Payne,4,1,I will not be watching Soccer Saturday on Sky as since they sacked three members its rubbish . I also feel when my Sky contract comes up I will not renew it . I mean they lost a lot of top sports rugby being the worst. Also I noticed soccer Saturday was on three channel's. As they have nothing better to show .
Ady Burrows,1,1,"Signal drop out every hour, signal won’t pass through two plaster boards, constantly disconnected from phones and laptops. Costs a fortune and difficult to use details do not get. The most frustrating rubbish ever."
Emma Gibbs,5,5,"Spoke to John from Glasgow yesterday as I wanted to cancel my subscription due to job loss. He was amazing, supportive and went above and beyond!! Defo got some good eggs!!"
Madeline Young,3,1,I moved home so signed up to sky...was told would be activated on 14th August so I connect and for a month I worked at hone and cared for my daughter who has a serious heart condition..having had open heart surgery and due moreTwo days ago it went off and I called to be told I'm not connected and I cannot be connected as no room in box?!I was told they cannot give me sky unless someone movesNot one letter through my door and I am now losing wages as I had to go to virgin who were very helpful and made us priority customers but cannot get until 1st October Sky say they do not care I cannot get in touch with my daughter heart specialist and they will not compensate me for their lack of communication and error This is the worst service I have ever experienced and it shows sky do not care about vulnerable people shielding in covid ..My daughter is now unable to keep appointments via zoom ...DO NOT USE THEM EVER THEY ARE UNCATING AND DO NOT PUT VULNERABLE PEOPLE NEEDS FIRST will be taking small claims court
Mathilde,2,5,"Not going to lie, I thought it would be really hard and costly to cancel my Sky Broadband & Talk package (which I renewed 2 months ago). But in fact, since I am moving in with someone who already has a Sky subscription, it is FREE! No termination fees. Thanks to Declan who was very polite and helpful. It did not take too long either to get someone on the chat. I have never had an issue with internet speed or such, and log in, bill information etc has always been clear. We will stay with Sky that is for sure!"
Adam Doran,3,1,"We've been with Sky since Autumn 2018 - we switched as soon as Fibre to the Cabinet infrastructure came to our area, having been previously held hostage by the local Virgin Media monopoly on fast broadband. (I had also been a Sky TV Broadband customer several times over the years, at various points in time.)When it came to moving house in August this year, it seemed perfectly sensible to remain with Sky, given the flawless service we had been enjoying, and competitive pricing. We went out on a limb and placed the order several weeks before being due to complete on the purchase, just to help things along, and were encouraged by the fact the install date Sky provided was only a few days after the planned completion date. Sadly this came, and went. Sky were quick to blame Openreach, who they say cancelled the order several times, but they eventually got it back on track, and were adamant we would have service shortly. Long story short, Openreach finally connected us up earlier this week, however they hit a technical glitch with the wiring between our telegraph pole, and the street cabinet. At this point, we've been told we'll need to wait till the end of the month before another engineer can come (and forgive me for having little confidence that it will end there). By my count, if the engineer does get us up and running at the end of the month it'll have been 57 days from order to receiving service.This would be disastrous as the best of times, but of course I've not seen the inside of my office since mid-Feb, and so am totally reliant on an Internet connection to perform my job. We've spoken with countless people at Sky, some who even seem to give a damn, but they're all essentially powerless to do anything, and seem unwilling to escalate our case at all.Avoid like the plague."
Claudia,5,2,"It was very very dificult to cancel the full subscription. However, after 2 months sending emails, complains and talk by chat (facebook) I sorted out. I recomend you to get in contact with them at least 2 month before you want to cancel, even if you was a 2 years user...The broadband is fine and never give me problems, however the TV is not good, stops many times... months without sistem, I stay all lockdown without acess and by the covid 19 rules they can not send anyone to my flat to solve the isue. I pay 43£ per month... what it was expensive in my opinion for this service. - good broadband-easy to log in -bad TV service- to difficult for cancel - not very good to contact the office"
Gareth Beaumont,256,1,"Where stupidity and ridiculous meetIt’s hard to know where they select the staff to work in the Priority Team, I can only assume they have had challenging lives and that is why they are very limited people who have a profound inability to deal with any situation using common sense.Certainly pleased to not be a customer anymore, there is a level of stupid that you can deal with."
Mindy clarke,17,1,Moving house. Deprived of broadband for 4 weeks. This company need to realise broadband an essential work tool not a net surfing leisure treat. Staff snide unhelpful and rude. One told me he didn’t know why I was complaining as they were providing broadband and it didn’t matter it was not to the house I lived in.
Mortimer O'Sullivan,2,1,"Sky rewards is a joke. I'm a 20 + customer and ""maybe"" rewards aren't worth a feck. Sky, give a free upgrade box to those who are faithful. I'm changing provider in February 21"
annamac24,4,5,"Excellent customer service this evening from Courtney (NI branch). Went out of her way to spend time to find me the best deal for my TV and broadband package, called me straight back when we got cut off and also providing tips to improve my wifi coverage. I've been with sky for years and always had good customer service, not sure why so many bad reviews on here!"
Terence Mosley,2,5,"I am just about to update my sky TV package to sky Q. I realised I had ordered the wrong package. I contacted them by phone. The service was excellent, 10 out of 10. Thank you to the gentleman who was so helpful.Terence Mosley 01276 684300 4 Donnington Close  camberley"
Terry Butcher,1,1,"Sky called me while I was driving offering a sports upgrade for an additional £15 a month for 18 months. I said ring back as i was interested. Sky never rang back. So i rang in. Could not find the person i spoke to. Sky said it was from the Leeds office & Team. Sky denied ever making the offer & making me out to be a liar. Disgusting service from Sky. Sky wasted my time & theirs. Trying to resolve anything with Sky is hopeless. Why offer something, then pretend it never happened???"
Dylan Halpin,1,1,I have to constantly test internet conections on devices i am using with your crappy broadband having to constatanly reset my boxes just to loads this page of reviews took me 10 mins yous have the worst internet on the planet go ram it up yis are holes yis dirty robbing knackers
michael brown,3,1,Highjacked our line and left us without internet for weeks. Sky allowed a third party (not living in our address) to take over our internet line whilst both WFH forcing my shielding husband to have to go into work in central London. BT (our supplier) couldn’t do anything about it as interfered in contract between unknown 3rd party and Sky.
Kieran Agnew,2,1,"Just had a sky rep try to sell me a package deal, as soon as I said no thanks he just hung up on me. I'm not terribly worried but that's some pretty poor customer service. Definitely will not be getting sky. Much cheaper options out there with better shows and movies"
Neil-kirsten Brown,2,1,Had sky for years since lock down I’ve got to say the internet (WiFi) has been absolutely appalling having to reset all my boxes that I have 5 to 6 times a day my only pleasure in writing this is 1 more week of this rubbish Wi-fi and then my BT broadband will be activated bye bye sky broadband
MATT,3,3,
Mike,3,1,Very poor service but actually no service from the broadband and Sky Q.Cannot get a response from Sky on this.Poor customer service
Anon,3,1,Sky Q is so rubbish you cannot even watch TV without it disconnecting. Expensive worse service ever do not buy from here it’s a waste of money and time.
louise,2,5,I just want to say I had to cancel down my contract as it had ended but because I didn't call on the final month it had ran over and charged me. I called and got through pretty quick and a lady called Angela from the Glasgow sky helped me process the cancellation and refund the charge. Angela was absolutely fantastic really nice lady and very helpful she was understanding with me about my own personal struggles with the covid and made me at ease during the call. I hope anyone dealing with sky gets an Angela as they also will be happy with the experience.
Jane,1,1,Months waiting on broadband.Promised updates and never got any.Major hassle cancelling.Not a good experience at all.
Heather Suzanne Ciesar,5,5,"I spoke to Sam (with dread locks) within the contact centre...to say she met customer standards is ridiculous! This woman was so understanding of the fact that we are in isolation she also showed amazing personal skills as to which I’m so grateful in the current climate, what an amazing professional person! Sky sorted in an instant! An asset to the company! Too good to be there to be fair."
Charlotte,1,1,"Sky are awful had no Internet since August 7th and they don't care called each day and complained and they don't help,terrible shocking service and this has been a really upsetting period"
Mr Bruno Buchmann,7,1,"Apparently I am a valued sky customer, so was offered an upgrade from Sky + to Sky Q, what a fiasco, this was ordered on 15th of August and scheduled for 14th September between 12.00 and 17.00, at 16.50 got a phone call from engineer saying he had just received my order so he wouldn’t be able to complete installation that afternoon, but would come and check to see if there were going to be any problem anyway, wasting his time and mine, came to house checked my sky + equipment and said signal was poor,so I’ve been paying full subscription to Sky for a substandard service, nice to know anyway checked loft equipment and said power was set to high so he couldn’t do anything and would rearrange another visit what a complete waste of my time, going to check bt vision can’t be worse than Sky, who don’t give a damn about their customers. Only reason their getting one star is because you can’t rate them zero.Checked my emails apparently Sky have been trying to contact me re my complaint but couldn’t get me, but their engineer could call me to say there was going to be problems and then again to say I would be surveyed to get my views on Sky HaHa but the complaints people can’t contact me ! Really :"
Elizabeth,49,1,"Terrible service. Sky booked for 14 September pm slot for new installation. Sky failed to turn up.No phone call, no email...no apology. An afternoon completely wasted. Going to cancel and get my money back. Quick to take money.....AVOID Sky.  Dreadful service. Time there was an effective competitor."
Adrianna,1,1,"They don't deserve even one star, and seeing that they never respond to negative comments, shows that they know they are bad and they don't care. Their customer service is non existing. Obviously they blame Covid, but if you are not a vulnerable person they will tell you to hang up and look on their website where MOST of problems can be explained. MOST not ALL. They are eager to take your money but will not deliver a good service."
stephen adolphus,12,1,Have paid for Sky fastest ever Broadband.Service has been simply appalling.Have never received more than 4 mbs and so streaming is a nightmare and not really useable....Impossible to contact Sky or to get them to take an interest.Basically being scammed - paying £27 a month for a service that barely delivers 4mbs.Their customer service really is the woarst even by telecommunications standards....It is genuinely not possible to contact them!.One thing I've noticed is they never respond to any complaints raised here which really tells you all you need to know among their customer service. Avoid at all costs.
George,3,5,I recently had a problem with my emailI spoke to someone in StockportFantastic He never gave up Solved the problem Sky service greatThank you
Sam Reynolds,3,1,"I’m disappointed I have to give a minimum of 1 star for this review. Sky don’t deserve that.Countless issues with our broadband over the last few months, internet speeds that make Dial-Up look good, absolutely disgusting, especially as we should have “minimum speeds of 52mbps” - don’t actually think we’ve had that since joining with them in May of last year.Thanks to COVID, I’m working from home and heavily reliant on broadband to earn my wage, and this has made it very difficult for me. Spoke with someone at Sky this morning and was told they’d send out a new router for us to see if that will solve the issue - that’s great, but what do we do for now without internet?Answer? “Just have to wait for it to arrive”Cheers Sky, at least I will learn from my mistakes and never use you again."
Chris Beaumont,3,1,Don’t normally post these things but I’ve had enough of big organisations offering appaling customer service and blaming COVID. Aaaaaaaaaand I’ve been a customer for 12 years. Plus they haven’t had the decency to call me so I won’t return the favour with a polite complaint.Abysmal service from Sky today. Booked an engineer to upgrade to #SkyQ on the 20th August for today (11th September)Engineer no-shows - you can’t talk to anyone as they’ve essentially closed their phonelines. Why? Don’t say COVID-19 because your phone operators can easily work from home. Wouldn’t be surprised if you’re keeping people furloughed to keep your wage costs down. Not really what it’s supposed to be used for... bet Rishi would be pleased 🤔F I N A L L Y blagged my way into talking to someone from the tech team... and I get told that someone from the engineer team will call me tonight to explain.No call - SHOCK! Just an email to say they’ve moved my installation to a week on Saturday (19th) - pic attached. My “favourite” part of the email (admittedly automated I’m sure) is the bit asking me to “remember to add it to my diary” presumably so I don’t forget 😂😂Great service guys. Well done. Bra-********-vo
Edwin Parker,3,1,"Well i was warned!!  Changed to Sky from BT. Waited for the engineer to arrive today (11th sept) rang me up to tell me he was 15 minutes away. 30 minutes later rang me to inform me that he was unable to fit me in because 'another engineer' was needed because it is a flat i live in (Sky had been informed of this 3 weeks ago when i joined, it has taken 21 days to come to install it)I said ''is it going to be today''? ''oh the engineer will call you''I got a text not long after informing me that i am provisionally reschedued for the 17th.BT cut me off yesterday i now have no internet or TV for a week. I am working from home and i no longer have access to the internet so cannot do my work.My partner is disabled and needs access to be able to do video calls to the Doctors, which of course she now cannot do.Tried phoning Sky and just get passed around the houses. An automated message told me to go online and make a complaint  how can i go online?I decided to cancel only to find out that i have to give 30 days notice or pay a cancellation fee!All of this BEFORE the bloody subscription has become active!"
V R Thomas,3,5,"Thank you Sky! After coming of from Virgin, you are such a breath of fresh air. Amazing customer service! Just installed my sky package..everything went smoothly. The people on the phone were so informative and polite. Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity!"
Lynne Martin,4,1,"Have been a customer of sky for 5+ years TV, Landline, Broadband & Mobile Phone, recently the internet has been awful & keeps dropping out even though it always claims the connection is good,  my mobile then eats into my rolling data so I am essentially paying sky for the bad connection!. They don't seem interested in retaining customers & clearly save all their best offers for the new customers!. What I was offered to stay with them was nowhere near what family and friends pay for more services and what they offer new customers! for my loyalty I was paying more for less. Shop around!"
David Williams,4,1,"Heaven help anyone who needs to contact Sky Customer Care, because they don't!  This is the absolute worst service even amongst bottom feeders such as the telecommunication businesses.  Which is a real shame, because it mars an otherwise good business!"
Starhippo Hippo,14,4,"I've been with SKY for 5 years + and, always had good service from them particularly with most customer service people.However in the midst of Covid-19, has been impossible to get through to them despite many phone calls and emails.Their excuse no doubt will be all things Covid.While this is completely understandable, i feel that for a multi billion pound company, they will be in a position to have customer service representatives working from home. But, this does not help customers who maybe wishing to 'cancel a contract or change to another provider' and effectively;leaving them stuck in  an existing contract as customer cant act upon the contract cooling off period.As they clearly don't answer their phones due to covid, this cant be a customer's fault.Their service in answering phone has now improved."
Liz,5,4,Customer service is very good but the signal is not very reliable
Nef,1,4,Had some issues on my account. Ahmed from Values was really helpful over the phone. He took his time to look into the issue and explain everything properly
Mr Figg,35,1,"Dreadful Internet constantly dropping out, been going on for months. They also just hike up the cost over and over again. Finally, got around to switching provider and get an email from sky saying they are sorry I am moving! They are so in denial of just how appalling they are that they consider the only reason anyone would change providor is because they are moving. AVOID"
Daiva,1,1,Very bad internet. Big money and the internet is not working.im very angry.there is no internet for a few hours every day.for what you take money?????
Jasper j,24,1,what happens when all disney chanels are taken off sky at the end of september 2020. does your subs get reduced?
DLIT,7,1,"17 years a customer (you may get Sky VIP but it doesnt enable you to contact customer service). Noticed an Ad on their website for Sky Football £18pm 31 day rolling contract add on to existing package. DONT BE FOOLED. Its not 31 day rolling, I ended up in an 18 month contract when I clicked through. Now I cannot contact customer service to cancel and replying to my contract email is not answered. Customer services phone is exclusively for NHS or most vulnerable and you are told to hang up and use the online help. No email address. No online chat, You have to send a letter (recommend recorded del). Another company taking advantage of the Furlough scheme and avoiding their loyal customers."
Sky,2,1,"An absolutely appalling service where I have been without a broadband, tv, and landline for 5 days. I am unable to get through to speak to anyone over the phone and have had no contact from Sky whatsoever. The website states that there is an outage in my area and that they are working on it, but going into my 6th day without a service, I am not brimming with confidence! Absolute shambles!"
Nicky Mallender,8,1,Just about had enough of the unstable internet service they provide! Internet keeps going off and when your trying to work from home it’s not good! Will be looking to move provider
JM,16,5,"I’ve been lucky!!Twice since March I’ve contacted Sky on behalf of my aged parents. Yes, I had to wait to get through but then the response has been great: listening, understanding and solution focused. In both instances, the people I spoke with worked very hard to resolve the issue and get the best deal for my parents. Yesterday, at 16.00,  Kelly really could not have worked harder to sort and get the best deal possible. I have moved to a different provider probably 5 years ago and I’m glad we’re all back now, thank you Kelly."
David J,1,1,"Sky Q TV + Virgin broadband (Ireland). Just not compatible.I really regret switching to SKY Q. Q boxes constantly dropping off line. Impossible to contact SKY. Tried everything online,ability to request engineer online - withdrawn.Try calling - wait time + 2hours. Basically if you subscribe, once the engineer drops off your set top boxes and departs - you're on your own.Awful customer service, actually its non existent, and I'm a customer for 20 years, Multiroom/HD/Sports/BT/movies - but not for much longer."
Jolita,1,1,"It took us a full month 4 weeks to get our broadband moved from one house to another, call customer service it’s an absolute joke, stay on hold for at least 40 minutes and be told wait few more days!!!! Unacceptable."
Saliya Shaikh,8,1,Its been 2 months our news channels ABP News and News18 were taken off by Skytv without notice.My husband complained twice over the phone only to hear its broadcasters issues.Theyre so unprofessional to cutoff our channels without notice and valid reason.We pay for it and skytv blames broadcasters.Recently we rang them to check why issue is not been resolved yet but they have stopped talking to customers over phone except vulnerable people.Moreover the number cuts off without even giving any options.Its a ripp off our money.
Ian G,7,1,"Despite Sky knowing when I was due to switch my broadband and land line services to a competitor, it cut me off from broadband 13 days “early” and it was not able to restore this for me. I had only spoken to a Sky representative 3 days ago to confirm the timescales for the switchover. I am shielding at present as a vulnerable person and the loss of broadband will have an adverse impact on me and my wife. Customer Service person I spoke to today was as professional and as apologetic as she could be, but even she didn’t try to defend the indefensible! Doubt anyone at Sky looks at TrustPilot but I have very few outlets to document my anger and frustration at this totally avoidable situation."
Louise Fairburn,12,1,"Expensive for what you get... or rather what you don't get. We pay for sky movies which is a rip off, sometimes you might get one good movie every three months, but all the good stuff is in the sky store and is more expensive than the cinema! Our sky TV is currently not working and theyve said it can only be fixed by an engineer; soonest they could send an engineer to us was in 14 days. So thats no TV for two weeks and the best they could do in way of an apology was to take £12 off our net bill."
Rhinal Patel,2,1,"impossible to complain to this company been having internet problems for so long, dont reccommend, my full complaintemail address given to complain does not workDear sir/madam, I would like to make the following complaint, if we dont get a response in ten days we will be changing provider. Both me and my sister work in media and this experience has been most distressing: Internet: Sky several times i have tried to make a complaint and i have been obstructed by your staff, i will be referring this to offcom, the consumer omdusman and dispute resolutions as well as reporting in media Our internet has been cutting out for last few years, we have done everything you have said including upgrading and paying extra, numerous engineers and calls which has cost alot of time and money Some days no internet had to use mobile data another cost and disrupted my workHours on the phone to customer services sometimes they dont help as problem not happening at the time Every person says it is a different problem after three years still same issue Customer services have been very unhelpful continually give wrong information and unclear about what disruption will be and how affecting others. The last call i was told would be two minutes, in total two hours and the internet was slow for few hours which we were not warned about beforehandNow thinking if leaving as customer services very difficult and problem still not rectified Dad vip customer and you are at risk of losing him for everything including tv and landline contract, he was also thinking of joining sky mobile but hasnt because of such bad service as you can see in recordsTv complaint During covid my dad was paying for sky sports when sky sports not available The tv has also cut out a few times in the least year We had upgraded box in after a few months all recorded programmes deleted on their own I am busy with work, my mum is shielded with covid and my dad has diabetes. I would like to make you aware very distressing and i may use your response publicly.As i say i will be referring to other providers and also looking for another provider. My dad is a vip customer that pays alot of money we are now 5unking of leaving altogether because of how appallingly you treat customers. Kind regards, Rhinal (On behalf of bipin patel)Sent from my iPad"
Dawn Pearson,5,5,"I moved house just after lockdown and decided to try Sky broadband as at our previous home we had had Sky TV and been really happy with that.The Sky dish was installed without issue by a lovely, friendly engineer two days after we moved in and the Sky Q box provided some great picture quality TV programmes.We had to wait a couple of weeks for broadband to be connected to the property. The engineer who came from OpenReach was brilliant, I had notification of his ETA and this was spot on. He worked on the connection for over an hour at the box to get it working for me. Unfortunately we should have had our router delivered a couple of days before the connection and as this hadn’t happened I couldn’t test the broadband straight away.Royal Mail had claimed to have tried to deliver the router to my address where they claimed it had been ‘rejected’. This was impossible as there were two people in the house all day, waiting in specifically for the router and no delivery had been attempted.After a couple of phone calls with Sky a new router was supposed to be sent out but I believe this didn’t happen due to Royal Mail now returning the original item to Sky.  Anyway after a few more phone calls with some fantastically helpful and kind people at Sky, a router was sent out to me and we received it the next day.I would like to thank the people at Sky who helped me, even going so far as to call me back later in the day to ensure everything had been sorted out.Plus our broadband is so much better than our previous provider."
D harry,7,1,"Why does Sky say they can’t take phone calls yet they ignore their community forums? 81 pages of people having trouble with Sky Q connectivity and not a single response!  Come on, Sky! Fix the SkyQ problem."
Billy,1,1,"recent upgrades by sky, our whole system is now f u c k e d. the main box disconnects 2 3 times a day from the broadband, can t watch sky go as again it's not connected. what a crock of s h i t. cancelling on Monday"
Lynn Harding,17,1,"Pie in the SkyWe're having spam phone calls but Sky Talk are ignoring my email requests to turn on Sky Talk Shield. Hoping for any customer service really is ""pie in the sky""."
Mr&Mrs Tait,4,1,"SkyQ ! what is the point of advertising shows when you have missed the first one and you cannot find episode 1 on many series? also new series features but again you cannot watch season 1? in particular The Assets, & X company I have found this on other shows end up having to go over to other suppliers to find. Disappointing features find it so hard to find good new series anything fresh keeps showing rubbish"
Si Fi,10,1,Long term customer and decided to change providers but they charged me a extra month for no services connected! I will not be going back to them ever all for the sake of £56!
یاسر صدق,1,1,when i join sky and bit a problem until lockdown and getting more problem with WIFI. i tried to contact them and they said it's normal and they think should add booster but i refused cos i saw guys come and fix network out side of my house few times since Lockdown. i knew they are up for something make us pay extra broadband or booster. it's still slow sometime use my mobile data 😡 i use my data and it's fast while use it and facetime with family etc better than broadband so slow. will never use sky again. it's poorly service ever i had it. sky always think money than customer.
Sophie,1,1,Our broadband stopped working on 6th August. We have had nothing but problems with Sky since then! It broke again on 24th August and no one has been out to even try and fix it. We keep getting told they will be out the next day but it never happens. Nearly 3 weeks without internet and shocking service from Sky! They don’t want to help and just ignore how much stress this is causing us!
Alexander,4,5,"Had trouble with internet speeds, and used the online Sky diagnostic tool. This directed me to contact their customer service.The issue was identified quickly and a technical team was dispatched to fix the issue.Great service, and will continue with the provider!"
Steve M,7,1,Over 50 minutes to answer a call. Asked annoying questions when wanting to cancel subscriptions. Joke of service.
Suneil,7,1,"Ordered tv n broadband package ...£39 offer advertised everywhere.  Took numerous attempts to purchase due to waiting in phone and then the reps saying can’t find offer.....eventually managed to get it and sat down to watch box sets included....on,y problem is EVERY single one want accessibl3.....Called Sky who said  I would have to add on n pay for high def......so the bug selling point of the offer which is access to box sets don’t exist within that price.....trading standards should look at this....avoid"
Pablo Puente,1,1,"This dudes create fake tinder accounts and when they get to your telephone, they call you to sell you something.."
Stuart Couzens,4,5,"Me and my partner are due to move into our first home together very soon and we were shopping around for tv and broadband. Our first choice was sky but we were unable to be quoted online due to our home being a new build. We gave sky a call and we were put through to a very pleasant and polite gentlemen named Andy, who works for sky in Newcastle.Straight away, I felt at ease when talking with Andy, I was a bit nervous as sometimes in situations like this, they don't care about the customer, they just want the sale. But this was not the case with Andy at all. Me and my partner were on the phone over an hour with him, he talked us through everything, no question was a silly question, I felt secure and very happy with the package Andy had set up for us. It was just like talking with a friend who knew a lot about Sky! Safe to say, him and partner got on really well! He went the extra mile for us today and we couldn't be happier.Thank you Andy for setting us up, we couldn't of asked to speak with anyone nicer and more helpful."
Mrs Pruden,5,1,"Another Saturday night, another problem with sky! After a week in work it would be lovely to sit down and watch telly that we pay £150 a month for but no, yet again another problem!! Sky is absolute rubbish! Cannot get in touch with anyone. I am getting rid! Don't do it. Constant issues!"
Lisa Conn,1,1,We were meant to have our landline and broadband switched over to sky a week ago. We have been left with NO broadband and NO landline. We have a severely disabled daughter and really need our landline. We have had no help from customer services and they cant even give us a new date for activation. Absolutely terrible!!!!
Amibeing1717,8,1,"Sky on the whole have a very terrible manner with customers. After a call with an agent who was more concerned with hard selling than helping me reduce my monthly bill due to a recent death in my household. I wanted to leave feedback but the agent subsequently ended the call, I sense there’s a lack of training which probably is the reason for such poor telephone manners."
Foulta Gaming,1,1,"Sky adverts might say they have good WiFi but in reality it is downright bad, i am in my house and i am getting 2/3 bars for wifi connection on my phone, super slow update time and always lagging on my Xbox, the worst part, i cant even switch because of contracts. Never join Sky because you will be stuck with bad wifi for around 18 months"
Chris Rollason,3,1,Noone to talk to. Noone to email. No live chat. They have stuck their fingers up at all customers. Utter joke. Go with bt stay away from sky
Julia King,6,1,Been trying to login to the sky app for months. This app does not work!! I know my details are correct as I can log in online but to access the mobile side you have to login via the app. You can’t contact anybody at sky to assist due to Covid. Even if you wanted to cancel you can’t as you can’t contact anybody. This is not acceptable sky.
Christine Jackson,18,1,Regret having anything to do with Sky.  3 hours and counting in phone calls.  BT were so helpful makes the comparison even worse.
mick,3,1,"Sky does not have a good customer service, if you have a problem you will be waiting over an hour just to speak to someone. Then if you need a replacement item then forget it, they will not send it and you will be left high and dry. Even if you are in contract you will be left paying for a service you don't have and you will need to go to a legal professional. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else"
Nfsnuxindk,1,1,"WiFi is slower than bought for. WiFi is extremely slow.WiFi has regular ‘deadzones’Wifi speed is unpredictable, rarely good, often awful.I DO NOT RECOMMEND SKY BROADBAND/WIFI"
Banksy,2,5,"Gemma up in Glasgow was a breath of fresh air giving me fantastic guidance & processes regarding my Sky issue. Absolute credit to the company, many thanks Gemma. 5* from Sedgefield, Co.Durham."
Vera,1,1,"Outdated, non-flexible contracts, not fit for purpose internet provider, useless customer service"
Vikkie Arnold,2,1,My bills clearly show no payment due for 22 days but oh no Sky want payment for something i havnt even had yet and now have suspended me Jesus Christ.!
Sharna,2,1,Sky is rubbish. My sky Q box mini always disconnects from the other sky Q box and when i reactivate it still doesnt work. Been with them for years and couldnt pay one payment and asked to pay the week after and they cut me off. Dont go with sky unless you want to be mugged off
Jayne,4,5,After a recent move and a confusion of addresses I have had to wait nearly 30 days to transfer my Sky to my new address I have to say it is not all sky's fault and would like to thank Fiona and her team for the beautiful flowers that arrived at my door today I have recently had an accident and I'm not in the best of situations and I feel that she has gone above and beyond on this occasion to promote excellent customer service. Thank you to both ladies named Fiona that I have dealt with regarding this. Your company should be proud to to you on board. Regards Jayne Yoh..Barnoldswick
Elliott Bolton,7,1,"Shocking!!!Agreed a new contract, noty honoured and took days of calling back to get it sorted.Asked for compensation and they said no.Such awful service."
Nour Shaath,3,1,I have been waiting for SKY to send me an engineer to install my SKYQ box since Feb 2020 - it is now September and im no closer to getting an engineer booked... instead they have sent me the WRONG engineer THREE times. The last engineer who visited said he would make a quick call and come back just never came back and every time i am promised a call from their cancellations or complaints team i never hear back. I spoke to someone called Kieran in the cancellations team last who promised to call over 6 weeks ago and ive yet to  hear back. Shocking service.
Ollie,2,5,"Great customer service.Had to wait a little to get through, but really helpful once I was talking to someone and problem fixed."
carter,4,1,"what a terrible company, having to wait two weeks for someone to sort out our internet connection really not good enough and no excuse, get more staff if you cant cope USELESS"
J C,1,1,"0 stars. Had an engineer booked in to set up our wifi and he/she didn't turn up and didn't even contact us to let us know they weren't coming. Called them today and the next slot isn't until 14th September so we now have no internet until then when my wife should be working from home. They blamed BT and when I spoke to BT, they blamed sky, like two kids in a playground blaming each other.Even though I had to take yesterday off work and now another day off work on 14th, they only offered me £25 compensation which is an insult. How sky & BT can operate in this way is a joke.."
Rory,4,1,"Sky are the most unhelpful company for anyone suffering from financial difficulties due to the current Covid19 crisis. I can't speak to an advisor because I cant pay in full today. Awful, nasty company. They are happy to contact me to upgrade but when i need assistance from them, I can't get it"
ryan,1,1,Sky TV Broadband is the worst provider ever it never has changed and will never. I use my mobile data and i'm getting 3G. gaming is unreliable. it goes off every second the internet. In the end do not get and leave immediately but be careful they take your money even though nothing happened!
Michael,1,1,How on earth do you get to cancel your tv subscription. I’ve tried everything and given the statutory notice but now they are sending me threatening letters because I cancelled my direct debit. Not a good way to deal with previously loyal customers but they don’t seem to care...
Sarah,3,5,At twenty to four this morning internet button started flashing amber then stayed on amber..phoned sky at 10am was told to do a few bits on line first to try and fix the problem myself but did not work so rang again..The gentleman said there was a problem with the line and they would have to send out a engineer which could take 2-5 days...well I'm shocked and thankfull I'm sitting here at 1.50pm 3 and a bit hrs later and it's back green and can use the internet..Thank you sky and thank you to the engineer for being so quick good service done by all
Jet Yau,1,1,"Would honestly give this a 0 if i could, I dont understand how they can even call themselves a service. Have been in contact with support several times over the past week and I get sent the same help articles even though I have listed numerous times that they do not help. The support/ help team is a joke. I do not understand how on earth it is set up so hand. I will be switching once the contract ends, never in my life have i ever had so many problems with a company"
He Who Must Not Be Named,23,1,"It's OK when it works, but now it seems they are missing the old phone I've sent them (£260, so not nothing! Sent on the 17th, delivered to them - by the tracking system - on the 26th, I am writing this on the 1st of the month after), and it's literally impossible to get in touch with them - at all! The phone line gives off a pre-recorded message and drops the call unless you are a key worker. The online help is crap. The community won't let me log on with an 'unexpected error'.How the hell am I supposed to  get in touch with the people I'm paying to? Messing up the swap is bad enough, but failing to provide ANY customer support is just unacceptable."
Janet Bradley,1,1,Cancelled services after keep being promised full package took advanced payments plus took another 150 out of bank 3 months after cancelling was promised it back after several phones calls ne erdrecieves now starting over equipment which was returned a d threatening to take further payment of nearly 200 pounds  modern day thieves
Flatters Scotter,1,1,"tell lies to get u to sign a new deal, i was told i would be cheaper for the same as i had previously. new bill was almost £50 more expensive (in call charges) as they had removed my landline package. no refund. also broadband is super unstable now, cuts off regular, about to cancel. crooks."
Stacey Wallace,1,1,A joke. When working is great. But if you have any problems its a joke. Internet went off 10 days ago. Have had 5 engineers out a new router sent and the problem is still going on. Nobody seems to be sorting the problem.
Rob,1,1,Absolutely appalled at their customer dis service. I’m moving house and they cut off my phone line at the request of the new owners without any authorisation from myself. I pay the bill!!Now without broadband until we complete on the sale. Tried to get through but ended up going round in circles. Up to only a year ago they were a decent company with decent customer service. Hiding behind the Covid excuse 100%. Why can’t they equip their employees to work from home. After all they are a tech company!!!Just after a fast buck without caring about the customer who will eventually vote with their feet.
Mike,6,1,"19 years I've been with Sky TV, but my Broadband contract lasted 1 day. Tried to swap from a reliable but expensive BT contract to save money. The service was due to switch over on 27th Aug. BT service finished as planned but Sky service did not go live, so no Broadband or land line. Eventually found a message to contact Sky buried in my MySky app (why no email, text or phone call Sky?). First was told there was an issue with my address and 6 hours later told there was an issue with the exchange / Openreach. 3 hours waiting / call time to find out the eariest I could be online again was Thurs / Fri next week. Immediately cancelled and call BT to re-sign with them as I work from home and need a reliable internet service. Totally useless customer and technical support from Sky. Very disappointed."
Howard Saurin,17,1,"Customer service non existent since COVID 19,clueless staff in call centres that don’t even know what they are selling off there own website, Been a customer nearly 10 years (This time)..Can’t wait for next price increase then i can get rid,2 days over 4 hours of calls and still got nowhere......total and utter disgrace"
Diego Fiorillo,7,1,If I could give 0 stars I would. Moving abroad out of my control as my company needs to be in the EU and they wanted to charge me a cancellation fee. Not to mention this was the worst internet I have had in 10 years and that is saying something as tech has advanced since then.
Resh,2,5,"I don’t know why there’s more bad reviews than good.... I’ve been a sky customer for over a year now and haven’t had any problems whatsoever! Apart from my speed being below the estimated but that’s not their fault! Always get through to someone within 5-10 mins, the speed and the pricing is excellent. Just spoke to a lovely advisor called anshum about upgrading to ultrafast at no extra cost and no set up fee! Very very satisfied with the service and the company! Couldn’t recommend sky more."
Andrew Gardner,2,1,Every time I call it saids you are more busy than normal - surely this means that if you are always as busy as the day before soon you will be the most busiest company in the entire world - ever. Wow!! Stop lying and employ some more start to answer the phones - job done.
victoria Robson,2,1,"Agree sky has gone down hill!! Been with them for over 20 years long wait for call outs up to 3 weeks, Q box not worked for over 3 weeks had to wait for engineer , 1 engineer over 3 hours on calls with fault line to get Q boxes working and I was offered a 10 pounds marks and Spencer’s voucher , SHOCKING! They really need to step it up their movies are expensive you can go to Netflix and get some of them for free."
Jake Brown,9,1,"Sky have really gone downhill..!They'll try to squeeze every single penny out of you. My partner and I were told that our Sky TV package needed increasing by 30% because we weren't paying enough money for it. I told them that this was unacceptable and that I wanted to cancel it because i'd just lost my job. They were completely happy to let me cancel, and then someone called me the next day asking me to stay with Sky but offering the exact same increase in price! Don't bother, they're too money orientated these days and don't care about the customer. Plenty of my friends are terminating their services with Sky."
rachel pendrous,2,5,Very helpful man his name is preshant he explained everything well very happy with my package 👍
Emily Payne,6,1,"After moving home, we had an internet switch on date of 18th August. On August 18, my wife called Sky as no box had been delivered but also had no emails - she was told openreach would not be switching on until 2 September. We were not contacted about this at all. For three weeks since the house move, we have been using mobile data to work remotely. I am a teacher, and my school has remote INSET training for how to teach in person during a global pandemic from 1st September. As a SKY MOBILE customer, I have had to add five lots of data, the maxmimum amount that it is possible to add in one month. As Sky failed to notify us of the extension to length of time broadband connection would take, my account was credited with £30, which covers 5 x £6 purchase of 1gb each time. Important to note ** it is not possible to make another purchase once five purchases have been made. ** Consequently, I upgraded my Sky mobile account to a higher tariff with more data, but the previously data plan came out of the new balance of data. I therefore called Sky Mobile and Sky Broadband looking for an option to either add another £6 for 1gb data, or to see if they could help out at all. It turns out, they could not help, unless extortion counts as a kind of help (it does not). I was told that as my account had already been credited with £30 (which was all spent on data because of their internet delay - hardly a 'goodwill' gesture in an age where connectivity is a basic need in order for me to perform my role as a teacher) no more could be credited. I was told no data could be added onto my account (I know that this is not true because my wife has had data added before for similar issue). I was told, as a keyworker in a pandemic crisis, that I would have to pay £40 to have any data added all by upgrading to yet another higher tariff of data I don't need and won't use in four days when our broadband is finally connected. All because they won't allow more than five add-ons of data (who on earth invented that rule and why?!) That's right. They were trying to make me pay £40 for four days worth of data, so that I can work from home as a teacher during a crisis. £40 to plug a four day gap. After I upgraded an extra £15 already, and paid £30 for the maximum number of (five) data add-ons. So, staring down an £85 surcharge for a delay of broadband delivery, my wife told me to say absolutely not, hang up the phone, and we would make a trustpilot complaint, an official complaint and would be contacting Sky again in order to sever ties after many years of being loyal customers for mobile and broadband. I write this review using public wifi on a public bench. I can't access internet at home due to their delay and the rules on adding only five lots of data per month. I certainly cannot perform my role as a teacher sat on a park bench to use coffee shop wifi."
David,3,1,"On leaving Sky in February, I have an outstanding credit that needs settled. I can't get through to them on phone lines. Can't email them. They can't service my request online. Surely this can't be legal - and judging by the endless reviews on here, there are hundreds of similarly frustrated customers. Ofcom...where are you??"
Ian Reed,35,1,Presenters are just woeful. Sky as a business support currupt premier league and deny access to sport viewing for most. Bad bad business model
Gareth Jones,1,1,Absolutely disgusting company re-signed up with them after 5 years of being with them for a better deal but found Vodafone had a better deal going the following morning so I rang to cancel as I was well withinn my 30 days and now I am getting emails saying I owe £122.00 cancellation fee W.T.F SKY bit late in the year and NO I don’t I cancelled 12 hrs later so 🖕🏻
AdrianLeeds,12,1,"Cant get 'em. Cant e-mail em, cant phone 'em; they send you round an internet loop. My screen is green; it telss me to update my software, which it wont. I cant even cancel with them. The e-mail doesnt work, the phone number is for over-70s only. I'm paying and it doesnt work and they dont care, like trying to get hold of the Mafia! All I can do is cancel my DD and wait. They've given up and hiding behing COVID."
Gareth Owen,6,1,"Sky have lost the plot!At a time when most loyal customers needed them to be more responsive they made it even more difficult than usual to contact them. Not even an email address to allow them to prioritise workload?!Big companies in time of challenge react, scale up, skill up, improve customer service. Not Sky. They took the opportunity to raise bills and reduce staff and contact opportunities for customers.Looking at recent reviews I am not the only one to feel the pain of their complete lack of response, hiding behind the excuse of lack of staff, focusing on those people more deserving of direct contact. I do not mind being prioritised by those more in need or higher priority but I do mind being shunted along to avoid having a conversation. I have cancelled my subscription online. I will never use Sky again.No excuse for a company of this size not to improve and stand out from the competition at this time. Instead they have skulked in the darkest corner and avoided their loyal community.I hope they realise what they have done to destroy their already average business."
andy,2,1,Trying to book a house move like requested 2 weeks in advance however because we are in  bradford they can't do it till out of restrictions however once we move and wait 14 days we can ring back so could be a minimum of 6 weeks but yet they still expect the payment Absolutely disgusting once contract ends I won't be back
Emma Smith,24,1,"I wish I could give them 0 stars! I was a loyal TV, internet and phone customer for years, even though their prices are astronomical and their internet service was not good. When moving house I waited in for three separate appointments, spaced out over three months. The first time, the 'engineer' came out, looked at our house and said, 'oh you need a a dish, you'll need a different engineer'. The next two appointments I was given, the engineer didn't show up at all. After getting fed up and, in order to get internet, phone and TV, I went with another provider. I sent all the equipment back, heard nothing from them other than regular emails asking me to come back. Now they have got a debt collections agency to contact me asking for £30 when I have never received any bills or correspondence from them! I try to contact them but they are only taking calls from 'vulnerable individuals', they don't have an email address and their virtual assistant chat is hopeless.They are a disgusting company and I wouldn't touch them with a barge pole ever again."
Apurba Bose,8,1,"Spent almost an hour on Phone waiting for a downgrade in TV package. For upgrade I can do online instantly, to downgrade anything I need to wait for an hour :) How many stars do you expect Sky?"
Chris,41,1,An hour on chat (which is the only way they will communicate) and I still haven’t managed to cancel my subscription. They make it as hard as possible. I’ve just cancelled my direct debit in sheer frustration. Why haven’t ofcom tackled this - it’s been going on for yeArs.
Annoyed,2,1,Broadband service just died. No one technical available and online manuals no good. TV service is now obsolete with amazon prime and Netflix. Both have no ads. All I need is a good broadband provider like BT. Sky’s days are numbered.
Lauren,11,1,"Been a Sky customer for four years. Broadband was so bad in this area then upgraded to Fibre Optic and this improved greatly. However, my most recent experience with Customer Service has been terrible. I bought a fight night through Sky Box Office and it frequently disconnected and blurred. I complained to customer service and they never got back to me. Not worth the money spent."

Tessa Stubler,1,5,"I am a Consultant who is constantly on the road for work. When I came down with the flu and was across the country, I needed access to a doctor quickly. Although I generally rely on reviews from family and friends to pick a healthcare professional, I was far from home and needed a service I could trust to get me into the right hands. Enter Plushcare! I was able to make an appointment online and speak to a reputable doctor the next morning. I will certainly be recommending Plushcare to my coworkers who are more often away from home than in close proximity to a family physician."
Bill,1,5,"I heard about Plush Care thru their Indiegogo campaign. I contributed and received a membership. I used Plush Care for the first time when I experienced a leg cramp while jogging. I spoke to a Plush Care doctor who was very personable and well informed. The doctor gave me a prescription for an anti-inflammatory, which I had filled at CVS. The entire process was easy and hassle free."
Maureen,1,5,I made an appointment online and spoke to a fantastic doctor from the comfort of my home. He sent a prescription to Walgreens for immediate pickup. I would recommend this medical care to everyone for urgent care type issues.
Stephanie,1,5,"I found out about PlushCare when doing a Google search for a nearby urgent care. I at first thought there was no way they could make seeing the doctor this easy and it had to be a scam. However, I gave it a try because the team had extremely reputable backgrounds from places like Stanford and UCSF. It wasn't a scam and it was just as easy as they said it would be."

289,3,Eddie L.,"I have been reading these reviews, and I reserve my option to give them four or five stars, instead of three.  I do applaud them for giving people an opportunity to voice their reviews here about Plushcare.  I don't consider myself stupid, I have a college degree and a master's degree but somehow I  was led to believe that this was a.doctor's """"visit.""""  I stepped on a large staple, and it was embedded in my heel.  It was a Saturday night and I didn't want to go to the emergency room. We all know how that goes. I needed it removed. ( I explained all of that in the description/instructions) It was only after I paid the $99, did I see the Sunday a.m. appointment was a """"video"""" visit. Obviously, you can't remove a staple through a video visit.  Perhaps, my bad.  Well, I spent the rest of the night and early a.m. calling everywhere and sending emails everywhere to cancel this visit.  Finally, the next morning, I received an email from Plushcare, advising that I needed a person to person visit and that they were going to cancel the video visit and issue me a credit/refund. (To appear on my account within 10 days).  My complaints, are as follows:  Much of all of this was run through Algorithms, although understandably, all on off hours...Somehow, I believe I was DECEIVED into thinking this was going to be an in person visit and not a video visit. Why will it take 10 days for the credit to appear on my account?   The cancellation was made mere seconds after the charge.  (As people say money is very tight these days).  Also from reading all of these reviews I don't want to be charged $14.95, nor do I want to be a member at this time.  So, I hope that doesn't occur.  Plush Care certainly has a place in our business world, and no doubt is a great service for those people needing such a service.  But it didn't happen in my situation.

296,1,landon ouzts,"Great service to start  (2 months ago) . I had a back injury and without Insurance needed to see a doctor. The doctor was great, and the appt quick . Issue resolved.However , one month later I was charged 14.99$. This is apparently their recurring fee once you sign up. I was unaware.No matter, the fee was charged and I called to cancel the service . I did not ask for a refund . I sat on hold for 30 minutes waiting to talk to someone . This is due to how they have set up their app and website (which don't allow you to cancel without calling ) it's a scheme to make it more difficult for customers to cancel the service. I'm sure one of their reps will respond and say """" the app currently doesn't allow you to cancel but you can do it on a desktop"""" . FALSE. I tried the app to no avail and tried the desktop only to be told that the system was unavailable to cancel at the time and I must call.So....anyway.... After my 30 minute wait I spoke to someone who assured me that the service would be cancelled . Add another 15 trying to cancel and I've spent 45 minutes trying to get something very simple accomplishedThe end .Just kidding. They charged me again this month .... After all that . So, I've sent an email and called my credit card to dispute he transaction. It's not about the 15$. It's about the lack of customer service and apparent disregard for my request to cancel . I signed no prolonged contract.I doubt any of that will make a difference , and I'll probably have to call and wait ...again.I figured the only control I have (without changing my credit card numbers) is to leave a review and show others how they've treated me.In the end this company does nothing but set up the appointment through the app. That part is great but apparently needs to be done by someone else . This should be a per appointment fee, not a recurring charge . I don't mind paying for the set up.I don't have your company on retainer and you've done nothing to help me at all.... The doctor did .",365,0.263216439451965,-0.14429880421798

The appointment was efficient and I felt like Dr. Cleary set me at ease about the process with Plush Care. As a skeptical person, I admit I wasn’t sure how quality the services would be as this was my first time using a telehealth provider. However, I must say Dr. Cleary was extremely knowledgeable and even expressed an interest in discussing my other medical conditions, which made me feel that my visit was not just about throwing medications at a problem, but rather reaching a consensus about a long term treatment plan. His approach was very comprehensive, addressing my medical history as a whole. In the end, I was able to get my medication refilled and I left the appointment feeling assured in the care I received and I can honestly say I look forward to following up in a few months.",199,0.421785357454543,0.345723261524786

319,1,Mariann Aquilina,STAY AWAY.  My grand daughter who is 2 was prescribed the wrong dosage of medicine 2 times.  The dosage was to high.  The first time she vomited multiple times  ∵ her parents thought it was correct.  Then my daughter called and spoke to another MD who said he was a pediatrician and he sent a script to the pharmacy for another antibiotic.  Since I’m a healthcare professional I reviewed it & the dosage was more than twice then what she was suppose to receive.  It could of killed her and caused her major health problems.  My daughter found the old prescription from her regular pediatrician which had the correct dosage on it.  This just confirmed how wrong this telehealth MD from this firm was.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Always check dosages before giving meds to your children.  They have to be calculated using their weight.,143,0.150779859378935,0.0733505608193906

I was extremely pleased with my entire experience and amazed at how quickly and easily I was able set an appointment to meet with Dr. Wu (within an hour of signing up) and get my prescriptions renewed immediately. I was very happy with how easy it was to complete the online information and to meet with a physician via video chat using my iPhone without driving anywhere or waiting to see a physician in person. I also appreciate Dr. Wu's undivided attention during our call, the excellent advice and feedback she gave me, and the fact that she answered all questions I had regarding a number of health related issues. I also greatly appreciate the fact that Dr. Wu was available to take a call from my pharmacy to approve a slight adjustment to my prescription because the pharmacy was out of one of the medications prescribed. I found the price to be very, very reasonable, especially for the level of medical service provided, and the cost to use PlushCare was actually far less than it would have cost me in time and fuel expenses to drive to an appointment and wait to see a doctor to achieve the same result.

Amwell may charge $199 for the initial consultation, however, it goes down to $95 from the second visit, which makes it more economical than Plushcare in the long run. I was utterly disappointed and disgusted by the way Plushcare agents reacted to my questions. Plushcare lack accountability, professionalism, and courtesy. Plushcare may promise you the world, but fails to deliver what they have promised. Quality wise, Amwell is much more higher and when I got fed up with not getting anywhere with Plushcare, I immediately signed up with Amwell within just a few minutes, and got my consultation the same day.

461,1,Love_Labs,"I don't trust Plushcare.  I paid $99 for a PEP consultation with Dr. Stephanie Anderson, which lasted all of 15 minutes.  I stated up front that I was paying out of pocket and not using insurance and the doctor confirmed it.  She didn't think I needed PEP and then the conversation gravitated towards getting me tested for PREP.  The doctor did not discuss the potential side affects or efficacy of PREP.  She told me to email her if I had any questions.  When I saw the lab order that she sent, I noticed that it would make me responsible for Quest Diagnostic's full rate and not the discounted rate that Plushcare has negotiated.  I tried to get back in touch with the doctor, but all of my emails were intercepted by people at Plushcare.  Every time I emailed, I got a different person, with a different story.  Ethan said the labs would be $105 and that they would send the correct lab order.  They didn't send it, so I emailed them again and Allison said I would be billed the full rate, because of the form.  When I lost trust in them and asked for a refund, they connected me with a """"Team Lead"""" named Janet, who said they could bill my credit card and send another lab form.  I got tired of the headache and gave up.  I don't even see any available appointments for Dr. Anderson in the near future anyway.  They don't offer encrypted emails, which is another thing the doctor failed to mention.  In the end, it was $99 down the drain and I still don't know if I'm okay or not.",272,0.210270036155747,-0.0584775143815056

It's nice that you can lie in your bed looking or feeling like s%*! until you get the doctor call from the time slot you selected. If a prescription is needed they can call it in and you can be on your way to picking it up via a drive through. I also love that if you need to follow up down the road there is a grace period where you won't be charged.   It's a smart and savvy company that everyone will be using in no time. The fee is minimal compared to going into a doctors office. Convenient and affordable. I believe your insurance company can be billed too.

From start to finish,  PlushCare delivered on their website promises.  The sign up process is easy and I was able to schedule an appointment that began 15 min later.  Dr. Wantuck called precisely 4:45 pm and was very easy to talk to.  He asked all the appropriate questions about my illness, medical history and current medications.  I was able to ask all of my questions and get clear answers.  He called in my prescription to a local pharmacy immediately after the call and also promptly emailed me lab test orders.  They use SonoraQuest labs in AZ and it was easy to complete the required tests the next day.  I was able to view my results online via Sonora Quest and had one abnormal finding.  I called the 800 number and Patrick was very helpful.  Dr.  Wantuck called me back in 15 min.  He explained the result and answered all my questions.

679,5,Alysia B.,"Yes. I'M rating this 5 stars. At first I was very skeptical about the service. I initially went online looking to schedule an appointment with walgreens take care clinic to address the ongoing issues with my shortness of breath, wheezing and nothing but ongoing coughing. All this caused by bronchospasms that I was previously diagnosis with last year of 2014 when I went to the ER for shortness of breath and wheezing. I was prescribed an  Albuterol inhaler as needed for wheezing and shortness of breath. Months went by and I finally took my last puff on my inhaler. So I dealt with this for quite some time without a prescription because I had no insurance due to being laid off. One night I could no longer take after doping myself up on 75mg a night of benadryl just to help deal with my allergies and my shortness of breath so i decided I would go to the take care clinic and that's when I came across plushcare, I did extensive research and looked on BBB and saw that they were legit and a had alot of good reviews. So I took a chance because for one it would be cheaper than paying $100 plus other fees to go to the take care clinic and not having to go to the ER for sure would save me a lot of money. NOTING that when I went to the ER last year for the shortness of breath I racked up $592 in medical bills just to receive a nebulizer treatment and steroids. But with plushcare I paid $69 for my appt and $58 for my inhaler with a $10 discount plushcare provides you with or without insurance. I'm from Chicago, IL so I had the pleasure of having James Wantuck, MD as my doctor. He called me at the specified time I had set up, ask me very detailed questions regarding medical history, medications and so forth, he was very kind and understanding and even told me what type of environment to avoid given my condition. What I also liked most was his willingness to make sure that the medication prescribed was going to be effective and if it didn't work to follow up with him so we can go to plan B. So yes I will be using this service moving foward. I told my family, friends and coworkers about this. Pls understand this is not a scam. Don't knock it unless you have tried and if u knock it well to bad for you, but I have my solution for not waiting for hours or even days to see a doctor and saving money. So thank you Plushcare and most of all Dr. Wantuck.",448,0.41285323959798,0.016717321058105
680,5,julie,"came across PlushCare while searching for urgent care options in Oak Harbor, Ohio. I was not necessarily looking for treatment during my call. Instead I was primarily calling to determine whether I needed immediate medical care for a set of symptoms that could have possibly related to a serious medical condition. I tried getting in to see several local doctors with no luck that day, so this seemed a convenient and viable alternative.The scheduling process was easy (though be aware that the time zones on the schedule may be for CA time and not your own) and I received a call promptly at my scheduled time. So far, so good.But what REALLY amazed me was the quality of the interaction between my doctor and me. He listened carefully and didn't rush me at all. He asked questions directly related to my specific concerns. Once I finished presenting my symptoms and concerns, he asked great questions. I've noticed often that doctors do not pick up on nuances or listen carefully and end up jumping to conclusions instead.After I finished sharing my symptoms, Dr. Wantuck summarized which of my symptoms concerned him and which did not. Since I was trying to evaluate how serious my symptoms were, this was extremely helpful. He was sensitive, compassionate, and I could tell that he was taking my situation seriously.Being candid, I will say that I had a high level of skepticism about the online doctor experience. I questioned the credentials of the doctors that would provide service this way, and didn't expect such a satisfying, professional experience.

It's comfortable, because the doctors are all trained from top-tiered schools like UCSF and Stanford, and their professionalism clearly reflects it as well. The cost of ALL visits (they'll keep seeing you until you've solved whatever it is you called in for originally) was $45, which is so much cheaper than the actual copay of urgent care firms. And the people working at the company were super friendly in receiving feedback about my experience and how they could improve the process.

Yesterday I realized my allergies had turned into a sinus infection, and by last night I realized it was a BAD sinus infection.  I went online to search for Urgent Care locations close to my hotel, and PlushCare was an option that came up.  I clicked on the link, and intrigued, I decided to book an appointment for a telephone consultation.  I figured that if it was too good to be true--and I was convinced it would be--I could then leave to go find a bricks-and-mortar urgent care location.PlushCare DELIVERED on their claims.  The physician called me within two minutes of the appointed time, and I received a confirmation phone call shortly after booking the appointment.  Within 10 minutes of finishing my conversation with the physician, I checked my CVS mobile application and my prescriptions had been received and were being filled.$40 copay on my insurance for a visit to an Urgent Care with a lengthy wait, as opposed to a $49 fee for a phone call consultation in the location of my convenience and a speedy course of treatment?  Done.PlushCare has a very satisfied customer who will use them again if I have a problem they can help me with.",224,0.26110568191325,-0.0349345043972098

I called urgent care and they didn't have an appointment available until four days out.  When I goggled urgent care to find a different location I found PlusCare. I figured $10 bucks in gas, $15 deductible, 2-3 hour wait, hanging out with a bunch of sick people; or making dinner, helping with home work, and going about our evening as planned. It was a no brainer! My Daughter thought it was REALLY COOL !  Doctor Miller called us right on time. W H A T !   yes, right on time. We then went into a video chat and after several minutes Doctor Miller was able to decide what was the best remedy for the situation. My Daughter asked how long do you think it will be before you can x-ray, do blood pressure and temp over the CPU. I would think sooner then we think. This is the way of the future and I am glad we were able to use PlushCare, Thanks Google. Another great point to make is Dr. Miller spent more time we us then most doctors have in the past, We didn't feel rushed ! Thank You Dr. Miller ..",210,0.388726307741745,0.288495759675035

For me it was EXTREMELY effective!Dr. George Rudy was extremely attentive, & quickly determined that my severe side pain was likely """"muscular-skeletal"""". (A relief, since some of the the possibilities I Googled were pretty scary.) He prescribed a muscle-relaxant & sleeping med, & gave me great advice. He even checked local pharmacies to find the best price! (I paid $11 at Target.)3 1/2 hours after my appointment I fell into blissful sleep. I awoke almost 13 hours later, feeling refreshed and with manageable pain. (My routine lately has been to knock myself out with sleeping pills and wake up 4 hours later, when the pain overcomes the drug.)At first I was disappointed that he can't prescribe strong pain-meds without a physical appt.. Now I'm convinced that the regime he advised is much better. It's a little more complicated than just popping a pill every few hours. Pain serves a purpose though. Now I have manageable pain that reminds me to take it easy & let my body heal, but still allows me to function reasonably... and SLEEP.Thank you, Plushcare, for providing a unique & valuable service.

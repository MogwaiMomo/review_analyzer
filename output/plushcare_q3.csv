16,,This was exactly how routine health care should be. I had an appointment in 10 minutes and a vurtual doctor appointment in 30. It was amazing. I will never go back to traditional health care.
17,,It's awesome to have such help whenever I need it and the way I can ask a question and have a response in reasonable time without having to go to the Doc office       I really love the help with my blood pressure problems and updates on my medication!
19,,"SCAM -  I have been signed up for their “membership” twice.  A total of $30, and i never approved either time.  The doctors cancel right before the appointment saying they can’t help with that and reschedule you with another doctor.  THIS IS A SCAM"
24,,"Doc was fantastic, understood my concerns & really helped me resolve my issue. It was easy, and extremely reasonably priced. I would recommend Plush care to anyone who can't get to their regular doctor during this strange time in history or anyone interested in a primary care physician online as an option or in addition to in-person care."
31,,I had problems with your software for my smart phone. Aside from that the doctor was great and I was able to get my 3 month refill which will afford me time to search for another doctor. Mine passed on unexpectedly
34,,I’m participating in a study through the organization Fitbit. Their watch uncovered an abnormal heart beat. It is currently being investigated through the sensor I just returned. I appreciate the free service from Fitbit. Hope to hear from someone soon.
39,,Doctor  was friendly and understood my concerns. He went over the types of antibiotics that I would need for my infection and recommended the correct one with minimal side effects of which I had none. I am 100% better thanks to him!
45,,Your service is wonderful. I was able to meet with a doctor within the same day and receive treatment. Dr. Barrow’s was extremely helpful and I’m happy to use PlushCare again in the future.
46,,I signed up for my husband on my phone and all the info that went into the system was mine. The Dr had to redo everything. While we like the service the ap form is very lousey.
51,,"As always, Plush Cares Doctors were responsive to my every need, took the time to listen and provide top-notch medical advise. In this Covid era, it's great to have Plush Care here on my side!"
52,,I really  liked every aspect of the process...my physician was outstanding:1.  This was an easy way to communicate with your physician felt as though I was I. The same room with him... he was thorough as you can be when in a virtual environment 2.  Your app was easy to use 3.  Got my  script within 30 minutes of the appointment
54,,"I had an amazing experience. My MD was spot on. I would def recommend this to anyone who does not want to possibly expose themself to the Corona Virus, someone who doesn’t have a ride to their appointment or someone who’s just too sick and doesn’t feel like leaving home."
73,,Dr Riad was very professional and kind.  I would definitely see him again.  My husband is thinking of becoming his patient indefinitely.  I would recommend him to all my family and friends.
74,,"Thank You very much. Nick is the young man who took my call. He is professional and his patience to be sure I understood the video call made this possible. My Doctor is smart, kind and sincere. I felt better even before I picked up my medicine."
78,,Excellent customer service! Excellent experience with my doctor. My prescriptions were ready within 30 minutes for pickup. I highly recommend this app. It also covers my whole family at no extra charge.
80,,One of the BEST Doctors I have ever had to see.  And to think they do this online and they are GREAT.  I recommend this service to anyone that needs a doctor in these times or other times.
83,,Dr. Marks is such a great physician & a great friend. He's very smart & thorough. I wish he were here in New Mexico so I could go & see him. I have never had a doctor who listens like Dr. Marks. I love him!
84,,I need some information on what I need to tell clients to do for reviews - I need someone I can text the clients info to. Please let me know the procedure
93,,"I absolutely loved being able to fill out the paper work online before arriving, receiving text reminders, and the link for easy check in. The techs were warm  and kind. I was also grateful that they were knowledgeable in finding veins. There was no digging around in my arm. Great experience all the way around. Will use again!"
110,,I gave a long feedback prior to this one. Amazing Doctors and so easy to use right from home. I love PlushCare.  I've used it a lot in the past four years or so.  I couldn't imagine not having them available .
111,,My doctor was extremely kind and knowledgable. As someone who travels consistently for work and doesn't have a home base this is a game changer. Also the PlushCare customer service rep got back to me immediately and got in touch with my doctor about extra questions I had after the appt. Solid company.
114,,Tried to sign up to get blood pressure meds but they can't find my insurance but for 100 dollars they will hook me up in 15 minutes I already wasted 4 times that 15 minutes  and they still cant or don't want to because they prefer cash I would have given them minus five rating but it was not available
117,,The service was great.The doctor was professional but down to earth. She really listened to my needs. Thanks so much for a good experience from someone who was nervous about going to the doctors.
119,,"I received timely and immediate professional care via a video conference with one of Plush Cares physicians. As a retired Hospital  Chaplin I know a little about what good medical care is and I would recommend Plush Care to everyone searching for good, compassionate medical care."
122,,This was a very easy to use platform - once I got my different devices working.I would prefer a face to face with someone who knows me but that is getting harder to come by these days and this is a very decent substitute for that with easier access.
126,,A shout out to Dr. Joseph Nichols who made my first telemedicine visit productive and enjoyable.Thank you for your thoughtful and caring approach in discussion; I will return soon to get the tests that you recommended.PlushCare is an oasis of medical services in a somewhat unhinged world.Much appreciated.
139,,"Dr. Marks and the PlushCare team have done an absolutely wonderful job following up with me and answering any and all questions I had. This was my first time using this service and it has honestly saved my relationship with my family, friends, & myself. Thank you for all your wonderful, hard-work!"
148,,"The doctor was polite,spoke clearly, listened to my symptoms and then explained why he was going to prescribe a different medication than the one I thought he would.  Cleared up the problem and I went back to normal(as it is right now) selfisolating."
149,,I really can appreciate the platform and the process it all went very smoothly in the doctor was outstanding period very helpful and insightful and was able to help me out.
151,,Such a great app and company. If I have a question they are very quick to reply via email. If I have a change in prescription they are prompt to fix it. Doctors and customer service are amazing.
160,,They charge a monthly fee for their services & the doctor I had prescribed a medicine that didn't work so I had to schedule another appt with another Dr. & had to pay another $30 deductible. I canceled their service!
162,,Dr Caesar was wonderful and has been a huge help to me during the lockdown in helping me keep up with my medications.  I would give PlushCare more than 5 stars if I could.  It has changed the way I access healthcare.
166,,It’s BS you won’t let me cancel through the app. It resulted in me being charged $14.99 for no reason. I will not be back. It’s clear it’s an intentional ploy to reap additional months charges from your customers.
170,,"I signed up for their service today and scheduled an appointment for 1PM MST with Dr. Austin Smith. I signed on at 12:55PM MST, signed off at 1:28PM MST. Doctor did not join the call at any point in time."
174,,"On my second visit, my Dr listened for a long time and I felt she was genuinely interested in getting to the bottom of the problem. Her prescription worked and didn't break the bank. Thanks!!"
180,,"Everything was easy to do...from downloading the app, to scheduling the appointment, to meeting with the doctor, to getting my prescriptions ordered.  The doctor was wonderful and listened to me.  She allowed me to be a part of the process, do research, and give input on what medicine may be best for me."
191,,"Because of Covid and doctors not taking new patients, plushcare made it easy and affordable to get my thyroid medication.  Every person I've spoken with is polite and helpful.  I was spacing out my medication because I was almost out and plushcare came to me rescue!"
192,,"It helps to see a doctor on weekends and evenings online wo/emergency room visit. This is the best part.  Please continue to offer this!  Also, please consider payment plans or a lower price on the 1st visit for the uninsured."
206,,The Dr. I saw I believe his first name was Rajid really not sure but he was very compassionate very knowledgeable and made me feel very at ease.   I am not a computer tech kind of person but it was very easy to access the service.
213,,I absolutely recommend Plushcare Doctors they are excellent!!! I have three busy boys and I utilize their services all the time. You can schedule appointments to your convenience all without stepping foot into a doctors office and without the worry of being exposed to Covid!!! They take care of all my family’s needs and have Excellent Customer Service!!!
215,,The APP was easy to use. I got to speak to a doctor within 30 minutes after signing in. Dr. Kristy Acosta was very thorough and pleasant. She ordered blood tests right away and gave me the prescription I needed for thyroid replacement medication. She followed up several times. I highly recommend Plush Care. Very Professional.
217,,I love that I was able to make an appointment within a few hours.My doctor had a great bedside manner and made me feel very comfortable. When I had a follow-up question customer service was excellent. Overall wonderful experience.
219,,This was a great service.  Saved so much time and money.  I independently checked the doctor’s credentials after the visit: top qualifications.  I didn’t have insurance and payed cash. Saved so much.
221,,PlushCare has been great for me! I’ve been able to get a lupus test done and my thyroid medicine refilled. I also have my primary care Dr. through PlushCare. My Dr.’s have been very compassionate and caring and took the time to listen to my concerns. Thank you PlushCare!
227,,Doctor was prompt.  Listened and came up with solution.  The only thing is that the dates on my excuse was more than we discussed.  I called to have it corrected.  It took until the next day to have it corrected.
228,,"Service is great but after each visit you'll receive about 3 surveys links by email. God forbid you don't answer them as you'll be reminded daily until you do. There is no preference setting to turn them off. If I mark as Junk Mail, I take a chance of missing an actual important email."
233,,"Absolutely fantastic. I'll definitely be returning. My doctor was truly one of the best I've ever had. Attentive, detailed, concerned (I appreciate the follow-up call), wise and experienced. SO glad I reached out to PlushCare."
235,,"Wonderful service. No waiting in a Doctors office for hours. You make an appointment by choosing the date and time. The video visit is over the app. Extremely convenient ,time saving, and economical."
248,,I suffer from anxiety and depression so even a doctors appointment can be overwhelming. I am so grateful for plushcare and the doctors are very attentive and easy to talk to.
250,,I'm very happy that I saved so much time and money.  This was very easy for an issue that was immediate.  My great insurance covered my medications as usual and they arrived the same day as my appointment.  I'm very appreciative.
262,,"Today was my first time using Plush Care, and I would definitely recommend the service.  My physician, Dr. Christina Garcia, was professional and friendly.  From the registration to the video chat, I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience.  I absolutely love it!"
264,,"PlushCare is an excellent service provider of the healthcare industry. Dr. Judith  Tessama was  my care physician. She is knowledgeable, understanding, empathetic and everything else you need a doctor to be. I recommend giving PlushCare and their excellent doctors an opportunity to help you during the COVID -19 epidemic. This is the safest way to go!"
267,,Spoke with a physician and was charged a fee for nothing! Got no prescription and now I still have no way to care for the issue at hand. Not like money isn't tight already! No thanks. Will not be using you ever again nor will I reccomend you.
269,,Crooks - had to pay upfront $99 to refill a prescription that cost $1.47. My insurance payed them later and they kept that too.  The next month there was a 15.99 charge on my credit card. Cancelled card - the last dollar they are going to steal from me.
270,,"Used Dr Thomas Wade with PlushCare appt today. Excellent on time, professional service. I was in a bind w/ bp medication refills. Was extremely satisfied..... my refill was at the pharmacy of my choice in one hour!  Really liked Dr. Wade.... thank you!"
276,,"There are so many times when it is not convenient, nor necessary, to go to a doctor's office. PlushCare to the rescue! The doctor's have taken care of my concerns in every instance at a time that is best for me in the comfort of my own home. They have been knowledgeable, caring, and efficient."
277,,"The kindest and most compassionate Dr. I have met, Dr Natalie Marino has an amazing way to communicate and care about the patient. I'm grateful for Plushcare and her. I recommend 100%."
280,,Sorry for the 2 star but I relied on you guys to get me a doctor for a MRI and you faild.i need to be treated but it seems like you guys have a non chanlonat attitude.  I looked elsewhere. The doctor was good the follow up never happened.
290,,"I was billed twice in the amount of $14.99 for telemedicine services I never ordered. The first fraudulent charge was refunded in April and a second fraudulent charge was billed on May 15,2020. A complaint has been filed with the California Attorney General!"
291,,"Paid for membership, booked and paid for appointment, doctor never showed! But they sure took payment from my account. Praying I can get my money back so I can find another doctor."
292,,"I'm sure not every issue can be handled using tele-medicine, but Plush Care sure has made it easy and effortless when its appropriate for the circumstances.  I'm very pleased with the care and attention I received from the doctor I saw - he was a real person, with genuine concern for my concern."
293,,"PlushCare is genuine and in my honest opinion quite unique experience.  Some individuals like myself cannot afford to go to healthcare facilities.  If you are a person who knows their medical history and are in need of a physician to  refill your medications that is needed on a daily basis, then PlushCare is the right place for you!!!--K. Barnes"
298,,I left a message for someone to contact me back early in the day.   Computer message said someone would call me back when a representative is available.  Its many hours later and still no return call.  I would like info about a test I took.   Thank you
320,,Stay away. Had a consultation and was approved for a Cologuard test kit. Spent four weeks faxing paperwork and e-mails to the company with no results. Very disappointed with this company. They seemed legitimate.
326,,I had  an amazing experience with Dr. Allan Marks. He was kind and thorough. He answered my questions and refilled my meds. This was by far the least stressful doctor’s “visit” I have ever experienced.

363,,"I am so thankful to have the ability to access a service like Plushcare. I have used them twice now and have had an amazing experience each time. The 2nd time I scheduled an appointment I had to phone customer service.  They answered promptly,  and were able to answer all my questions.  Thank you so much!"
365,,"Scheduled an appointment while at work at 10:30am through the app. Had my appointment at 11am through video chat. Had my talk with the doctor, prescription called in and back to work at 11:05am. Picked up my prescription on the way home. Well done PlushCare"
367,,At first I thought it was a gimmick I look to go to Quick Care they wanted 150.00  to walk in the door and whatever the doctor charged in back...so the 99.00 was no problem... professional experience would recommend to anyone they even called  my prescription in thanks plushcare..give it a try!!!!
372,,"The PlushCare Doctor was very sympathetic and kind hearted.  He listened carefully and asked pertinent questions directly related to my diagnosis.  He reviewed my written medical history with me, he was very thorough."
379,,My experience with PlushCare was very positive leaving me feeling confident and well informed after my phone visit. All of my questions were answered and our conversation never felt rushed in order to keep within a certain appointment period. PlushCare is a service that I plan to use on a regular basis and will recommend it to others.
385,,I love the convenience and the cost. I was able to have my doctor's visit in my office without taking time off work and my prescriptions we're ready at the closest pharmacy when I headed home for the day. For those with kids away at college it's great too!
396,,I had reservation about seeing a doctor via video conference. But the doctors were very professional. Very knowledgeable. Answered all my questions. I would definitely continue to use the service and recommend the service as it is often more convinient than traditional outlets.
398,,"I had an excellent visit with my doctor. She listened to all my concerns, I was not rushed by any means. I felt very comfortable.  In the end medication was prescribed and at a very low cost $3.  I would definitely recommend PlushCare to all!"
402,,"Fast, efficient way to handle minor issues without having to go to an emergent care where you might be exposed to other illnesses from people waiting to be seen. I've used PlushCare twice and have been very happy with them."
406,,"The doctor that i talked to, talked to me like she was doing me a favor. She was a bit confrontational i believe that she thought that she was the employer and i was the employee and not the other way around."
411,,My doctor retired and I didn't know how I was going to get the prescriptions that had to be refilled. This was great. I talked to the doctor he sent the refills my drug store and them the same day. Thank You
413,,"I was iffy about using PlushCare at first since I never heard of them, but I gave them a chance and I've been using them ever since.  The doctors are great and they listen and they're always on time.  Excellent service! I've never had an issue and they take insurance. I'd give them more stars if possible."
417,,Ordered lab test in excess of what my PPO covered. I have good insurance so this came as a surprise when I received EOB stating test not covered due to them not being necessary for what was being tested for.
437,,Doctor was excellent and what he gave me fixed my problem :) I am very happy because I was dealing with a pinched nerve on my neck which was driving me crazy!
447,,"I really appreciate that Dr. Nair took the time to explain how my meds work, and why periodic blood work is needed. It was the most informative medical visit I've ever had."
451,,I am running a successful small business and it doesn't leave a lot of time for things like sitting in a doctors office for an hour or more. Especially when all I want to do is renew my blood pressure medication.
457,,"I've used PlushCare multiple times for medication refills when in a bind. Last time, while on my way to Florida I realized I was running low. I booked an appointment and got a prescription refill while waiting for my flight! It was at the pharmacy waiting for me when I arrived at my destination. Pretty cool stuff!"
460,,"Amazing experience. So much easier than going to a doctor's appointment when you do not have the time to take from work for something simple as a cough or cold. Even with flu symptoms, I would choose PlushCare first before trying to get myself out of the house and wait in a waiting room while not feeling well."
462,,"Fast, convenient and affordable. Personable doctor that was knowledgeable. Nothing better than getting taken care of out of comfort of my own home when not wanting to leave home due to illness. Definately will use in future"

482,,I was able to speak to a doctor and be en route to the pharmacy before my local urgent care even opened! The doctor made it really easy and I appreciated being able to get back into my weekend more quickly.
491,,"I was too sick to make the trip to the doctors office, however, the care that I received through PlushCare was excellent.  (I worked at a Level 1 Trauma Center for forty-five years and I KNOW excellent care.)  I would not hesitate to call them again if need be.  Thanks PlushCare -"
495,,I've had nothing but the best experience with plushcare. All the doctors were so professional. They always asked the questions i forgot to ask. Its so convienant to book appt with the availability they provide and always called on time. Its the best.

504,,I was in a bad place.  My general doctor decided she wanted my Endocrinologist to prescribe one of my meds.  My Endo did not want to prescribe said medication.  As you can see this was an issue.  PlushCare saved the day!  I am so grateful to have found them.  Thank you to the Doctors at PC.
506,,"I received more information, and fantastic tips, from the Plushcare doctor than I EVER have from any regular PCP I've had for my seasonal sinus infections. He was not hurried or seemingly distracted as my doctor always is. I didn't have to go into a germ filled office with my healthy children in tow. Great experience all around."

511,,The follow up appointment they told me to see a doctor in person. When I called back they said that I already had my follow up and they'd call me back and didn't call me back.
514,,"I have had Great Care from the doctors of Plush Care. I will use them in the future! So easy to get care from your home when you need it right away, love Plush Care!!"
517,,"This is great service, very convenient,  Doctors are extremely inquisitive and polite. The only problem is both times  I've used this service, there are video problems, and my insurance covers that service. I was told it was androids only. Otherwise great experience."
521,,"I've used several Doctors so far, and all have been caring, honest and helpful. I don't have anything negative to say and I really don't care for dealing with Doctors. I would highly recommend, and very easy to make appointment and use."
522,,It was a wonderful experience.  I had no doctors as I had just moved and the urgent care was closed.  I felt helpless until I found PlushCare!  It was such a comfort to know I had someone to turn to when I was not feeling well.
526,,"Dr. was excellent. Process was easy and well thought out with reminders, instructions, etc. This was an easy process and I will be using the service again soon another family member. Call backs are prompts, scripts are called in quickly. Overall could not have been better."
537,,"Patrick the customer representative who returned my call initially was very polite, knowledgeable, and courteous. Dr. Sargent who returned my call was excellent.  I was treated with concern, great knowledge and courteousness. Thank You"
541,,"Didn't have to wait long for my appointment (great!). Time on the phone with the Plush doctor was actually longer, a more thorough discussion of my concerns, than my experiences with my """"regular"""" doctor in his office (plus, no waiting-room time around coughing and sneezing people waiting to be seen.)"
544,,Was a great experience.   Made my appointment online and was speaking to the doctor within the hour.  Had prescriptions picked up within two hours.   Super cool experience.   The doctor called me the next day to check and see how I was feeling.

She offered some good advice and further encouraged me to follow up with my primary doctor and set up appointments for further testing .

605,,"I was hesitant at first that this was all I hoped for but it was exactly what I needed. I made the appointment online, the Dr. called right on the dot, we spoke of my symptoms for 7 minutes, he called in Rx to my local pharmacy. Easy, fast, convenient. I highly recommend!"
608,,"Excellent service and so convenient. The only problem I had was that they didn't accept my health program, Humana, and that makes it too expensive for me to use as often as I would like to."

The doctors really listen to you and probe for details about your health concern before prescribing any meds. I have told many people about this service and stand behind their practice."

619,,"I have received thorough and professional care for recurring or urgent issues - such as U.T.I., and filling a prescription while on vacation. PlushCare doctors take the time to make sure their diagnosis and treatment are appropriate. It's much more convenient and cost effective than a brick and mortar urgent care."
629,,"So fast, easy, efficient and better than Dr.s I have seen in person.  The Dr. listened to my issue,  offered a solution and it was one that worked. Well worth the money and much cheaper in the long run than dealing with a lot of unnecessary tests, etc..."

651,,I made an appointment online with PlushCare and it was simple and easy to use! Talking to the doctor over the phone and not having to make my way in for a visit to be diagnosed and treated was really convenient!
653,,Couldn't get in to my local doctor.  Found this place after a quick search.  Booked an appointment and was seen in less than hour.  Everything went well and I was prescribed what I needed.  This experience was infinitely better than my normal waiting 2 hours to be seen by a nurse or physicians assistant at my doctor's office.
654,,"This is exactly the sort of thing I wish someone had thought of years ago.  This way, I didn't have to wait in a waiting room and give other people my germs (and be exposed to theirs!) when I'm sick.  I just booked an appointment online, the doctor called and prescribed the appropriate medication.  Couldn't be happier."
656,,I had contacted PlushCare because I had a rash in an embarrassing location. By being able to video chat it made me feel more comfortable and I was able to get medicine and my rash cleared quickly. Thanks doc!
659,,I went to Plush Care for an upper respiratory ailment. Their diagnosis was spot on. And their attention to detail and care was far beyond what I typically receive at my local doctors office.

697,,"This was the easiest doctors appointment I've ever booked. I was able to make an appointment for the same day, talk to the doctor and get the help I needed. This is something that I will definitely use in the future and recommend to my friends and family."
704,,"Easily one of the best services I have used. Seamless end to end, super fast, if I could rate this service higher I would. Doctors were punctual, professional, and I was diagnosed in no time."
707,,"George was thorough, caring and knowledgeable. Being VERY wholistic myself, I liked that he recommended every possible remedy before resorting to drugs. I love the free follow up if necessary, and saved AT LEAST $165 over a walk-in clinic. I will definitely use them again if I have the need to."
710,,"Dr. Marks was professional, courteous, and explained every step of the process. He even went out of his way to find a 24 hour pharmacy in my area to send my prescription to. He went above and beyond my expectations. Patrick at the call center was also very helpful with setting up the appointment."
714,,"Tried calling my regular doctor who only had an appointment 2 weeks away.  Instead called Plushcare and scheduled a appointment, talked with a doctor, and got a prescription all in ONE DAY!  Finally technology has caught up with modern medicine to make the entire process quick and easy."
717,,"They were very concerned about my problem. I drive large vehicles, and they even found places along my route that I could park in. Had to have 3 different meds phoned in and there was no problem. Everytime I was in a different state and no sweat it was called in and buy the time I got there it was to"
719,,Going to the doctor has always been a pain for me so this service is awesome. I've also subscribed to it for my children through the Indiegogo campaign but have not yet needed to see one of their pediatricians which I'm confident will be just as great and it provides me with a sense of security.
720,,"I couldn't believe how quick and easy it was to create an account and schedule a same day appointment! Best of all, I was feeling back to normal before the first available appointment with my PCP. Thanks PlushCare!"
721,,As a sales executive I'm constantly on the move and my schedule has never aligned well with making doc's appointments. I recently caught pink eye and the PlushCare team diagnosed it and provided me with a prescription from my hotel room. Phenomenal and will be using them for here on out!
722,,"Plushcare is a hard working team that's focus is always on you.  The team is constructed on professionalism, integrity, and perfection.  During the whole process, you truly feel that you are being taken care of and your time is being respected; I would recommend Plushcare to my mother."
726,,They took the time required to understand my specific condition and were able to suggest a personalized course of treatment. The entire visit (virtual) inspired confidence and I will return to this company without hesitation.
727,,"My biggest deterrent from addressing medical issues is the inconvenience and hassle of delays and waiting at a doctor's office.  During my virtual appointment with a Plush Care doctor, the doctor was prompt and friendly, then listened, diagnosed and resolved my situation."

739,,I hate going to the doctors so this for me is PERFECT. Most of the time I just have a cold or something easily diagnosable.... so this service has been super helpful.
743,,I made an appointment online and spoke to a fantastic doctor from the comfort of my home. He sent a prescription to Walgreens for immediate pickup. I would recommend this medical care to everyone for urgent care type issues.

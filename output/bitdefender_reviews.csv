QPR Dave,2,5,"I’ve been a Bitdefender customer for a couple of years now as I’ve found it’s the best protection for my Mac. The support team in the US are very friendly and professional and despite the time difference will come back to you quickly. The product is efficient and easy to use. Recommend the product and the support team behind it, 5 stars people !"

Bill Freauff,3,5,Requested Customer Support assistance via their dash board tool and used a chat session to resolve all my issues and questions promptly and securely
Apleekiss,1,5,I have been with Bitdefender for 7 plus years. I feel so confident and secure. I know that you guys work harder to ensure of all our home devices are well protected it. Thank you so much!!! I will continue with your services for many years to come. Awesome!!
Leo Poveda,1,5,"Took Total Suite for a trial run and was so satisfied, it made my decision to stay on board easy. My interaction with customer service was effortless yet fruitful. They were patient and thorough - thank you!"
Jack Buonanducci,4,5,Your online  CS person was very helpful and  understanding my limited know how with computers
Marsha Brown,3,5,"I contacted Bitdefender via chat with a couple of questions, i.e. whether my anti-virus would be automatically renewed across all of my devices. I was answered quickly and professionally. I remember asking another question, but now I don't remember what that was. I do remember having that question similarly answered quickly and professionally."
Richard,3,5,Very quick response to emailed question.
Jem Aguilar,1,5,
Marco Jetzen,1,5,"Helpdesk efficient, polite and helpful. In line with the positive product experience."
Naraian legrand,1,4,"I use the free version and expect no problems! If any, the support team is great. Got back to me within a couple of days! It's light on your CPU while strong on the virus!"
Danny Cadman,6,1,Bought bitdefender thru PayPal didn’t receive my bitdefender code or anything to download from 2checkout apart from them asking for my bank details so I’ve escalated it with PayPal won’t be buying bitdefender ever again
Judith,1,5,I have had two issues with my renewals but both were resolved above my expectation and done very quickly.  This is an excellent product with excellent support which is rare these days.
Nancy Nystuen,1,5,I needed to ‘transfer’ my Bitdefender service to my new hard drive (old one fried in electrical outage).  Asked for assistance by phone and detailed instructions sent by email.
James Barton,8,5,Head & Shoulders above the rest!  Norton talks about what BITDEFENDER  Gets Done.   Great Product and Customer Service which is seldom needed. Flawless Interface and Best Protection.
Kristen Lee,1,2,"Auto renewal taken for £69.99 when I wasn’t aware I even had that in place. I contacted them immediately and requested a refund I was offered a discount which I declined as I no longer require the software and received no response I have done this twice now and same thing has happed I have yet to receive a refund even though their website states refund within 5 working days and 30’day money back guarantee this has been going on since the 24/12, utterly disgusted in the poor customer service I am receiving and want a refund ASAP"
R.Acevedo,1,5,"Excellent Tech Support. Reached an agent fairly quickly, explained my concern, and was able to get clear and straightforward direction on a resolution that worked perfectly. 10 out of 10."
MICHAEL NEWEY,13,5,No IT expert but seems to provide extensive protection
Norman Johnson,1,5,I had Internet Security already installed on my computers. I had 60 days left on my subscription. I upgraded to Total Security not realizing that it was two different subscriptions. I called customer support and they explained to me what I did. They change everything over to Total Security and extended my subscription. Customer support was really professional. Thank You!
Michael,2,3,"Good product, but awful support/service. Received email saying I had 10 days to take advantage of a discounted renewal price, then promptly took money through auto-renewal 2 days later! When I contacted them they promised to refund the difference but then never issued the refund - and are ignoring any emails I send. Spoke to CS in chat and they promised to get someone to contact me. Nothing...Update - finally resolved. Thank you."
Kevin Poole,5,5,"I have been a customer for some years.  The Total Security software works well, does not slow down my system and on the one occasion when I have had to use customer support by phone, they resolved my issue straight away.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to clarify the confusion around the various different channels through which you can buy the software - straight renewal via the Dashboard is rarely the best value, and sometimes there are glitches in adding newly purchased licences onto existing subscriptions."
James,2,5,"Although there were initial install issues, this was not down to Bitdefender and they offered a solution in a timely manner even with it being a very busy period (mid lockdown). The product itself offers a large range of checks to ensure the computers and other devices I use are running smoothly. There are checks that my previous provider did not offer and it's ability to highlight even low risks to my devices allow me to make considered decisions about the action to take. The range of available features are impressive. The only downside would be the amount of data available to use on the VPN on the package I have, but having never used one before it isn't something that is a large concern."
Laura C. Bergman,1,5,"Some companies have customer service that you must email.  Not Bitdefender.  I called them, got a representative right away.  He was very helpful and resolved my issue (which, in all honesty, was my error.)"
Steve Sole,3,5,WOW!! I cannot believe how good this is!! My laptop has been running so slowly lately and I have been pulling my hair out!! Ran the scan and it must be running maybe 20x faster AT LEAST!! AMAZING and i managed to get a real good discount on it! Well worth its weight in gold! :)
Erle Penn Joe Jock,1,5,I switched from a previous antivirus system because there was one issue that they could not resolve.   Being with Bitdefender I have found that Bitdefender checks for more security issues and resolves them and gives me feedback as to what they found and how it was corrected.
customer,2,4,"I am puzzled because in the past when I've bought a new subscription early, the remainder has always been added on. This time it wasn't. So I lost about two months. I will not in future buy early."
Peter Billington,3,5,"Needed to add a device with a standalone subscription into an existing multi-device subscription.Instructions from Support were precise, clear and helpful.Whole thing was completed in a few minutes."
Ward Ed,1,5,"When I learned that some windows 10 versions cannot install your products, it gave me a lot of inspiration, and now the problem is solved"
Bryce,12,5,Very useful personal account software at a reasonable price. i have been using it for quite a while and had very few problems. Support was able to help me very quickly with these did occur. I am very happy with the product
Malcolm,6,5,I have used this service for several years and when I met with a minor glitch it was quickly corrected.
DAVID FENBY,1,5,I had difficulty understanding why I had two Bitdefender accounts.  I asked the question; the reply was prompt and fully clarified the situation.
ParhaM,1,2,"I really thinking about migrating to another suite, i can't handle this bad habit of Bitdefender, they sometimes ignore your tickets like my last one i asked them about Bitdefender wallet on android it's been almost 3 days yet no response, and i'm their Premium security customer which should have priority support.. but yet.. or like the other one that i've send to bitsy@bitdefender email about their HotforSecurity blog' The Team page broken and it's more than 2 weeks now no answer... i hate this habit of Bitdefender and it's one of the old ones they got for years.."
Chris L,1,5,"I was unsure which anti-virus to purchase, Bitdefender was recommended by a colleague. It's a good product, however, shortly after install I encountered a problem and this is where it really shines. Customer support team very helpful solved the problem in a friendly professional manner."
Art Himself,1,2,I had no issues with the product. Used it for a year but now I'm up for renewal I'm being charged double for what the cheapest price is online. I just wanted to check with customer service if I can get the best price I was told just to buy a new subscription by the most unhelpful CS adviser. Normally these guys on the chat are super polite and helpful but the exchange I had was rather unpleasant. It is sad that a company would try to sneak in a double pay in your auto renewal.
Eyal,1,5,"Best security software, awesome prices and great customer service"
Gujo,7,1,"1. Heavy and intrusive software, slowering yr configuration.2. Flood of notifications for apps you don't even know what they are and theyr use, so, allow or not ?3. Unexistent support. They let you just remain in your...4. And you'll never completely get rid of it, even with theyr cleaning tool.To avoid.Could not reinstall total security on my pc. asked help from support. received nothing. I'll have to buy a new protection software."
Simon Morris,7,5,"Having now had Bitdefender for the last 3 year and had total satisfaction, I have now extended it for another 3 years. Having had a slight problem changing over to the new program I contacted the customer service who sorted it in no time. Without doubt I would recommend Bitdefender to everyone."
Rimuru~san,2,5,"Customer care hotline was easy to contact and resolved my problems quickly. Had used the android security for 2 years, and I was double-charged for the renewal. I contacted the hotline and one of the charges was refunded within 3 days. Service was good, although they might not find your transaction details on the first try - so send them your transaction details in advance to reduce the time taken for them to solve your problem."
Ernesto Cham Wong,1,5,"Quick installation, also very affordable prices."
Aigle Bleu,3,5,Best antivirus I've ever had and impeccable service.
Helmuth Freericks,2,5,Had some problems with multiple accounts. figured out that it was a cookie problem
Liz,2,1,"I can't activate the licence, having gone through online advice and the first level of their customer service."
Brad C,1,5,"I am a long time use of Bitdefender, for the past twenty years. Continue to applaud their great security program-Total Security. Also when I have had to deal with support, which has been rarely, their call centre/technicians are always helpful and patient. I always recommend their products to family, friends and colleagues"
Grace Donofrio,1,5,Customer service is great. BD security is great. I don't have to be concerned about finding a bug BD is great about taking care of all that. It also warns about bad sites and cautions you about applications.
Brian Erhardt,13,1,"Bit defender does not appear to offer support, pity they cannot answer a simple question without stealing huge amounts of data from your computer. That scenario occurs far to often to be mere technical data regarding Bit Defender. It is comforting to see they reined in their VPN app  at least you can turn the damn thing off now. The real shame is software unable to take advantage of 64 bit, I mean this is 2021 not 1986.Another thing I have to mention is BitDefender seems to have fixed their VPN issue, but when I kept begging for assistance in repairing issue, so that I may be able to use the subscription I paid for, what did these jerks do, blacklisted the activation code. This was done instead of addressing the concerns of a registered owner, and rendering the software and legal activation code useless, Thanks."
Peter Berník,1,5,"On my Bitdefender Central account, I have activated the two-factor authentication (by means of Google Authenticator). However, I have also reinstalled my mobile phone (I have updated an Android version) and Google Authenticator. At the moment, I cannot cancel the two-factor authentication on my BItdefender account because the codes generated through Google Authenticator are not working. I would like to cancel the two-factor authentication. After some administration, Bitdefender support solved my problem. Thanks a lot."
Justin Gilbert,1,5,
Clive Coleman,1,5,I upgraded my existing anti virus but was unable to install the new software. I messaged Bitdefender and explained the issue and received a prompt reply explaining clearly what I needed to do in simple language.
Sue,1,4,I just purchased Bitdefender Premium Security and so far I do recommend this product. Installation on most of my devices so far was not as difficult as I assumed it would be. The customer service was very helpful in helping me make the decision to purchase. I may have more comments in the future as I try to navigate using this product.
Konstantinos,1,5,Smooth operation for users with a low level of specialization.
Oladele Jacob,1,5,
customer,3,5,"Bitdefender is lightweight antivirus solution, with high malware detection ratio! And bundled with internet protection and many features, every modern antivirus is expected to have. It has multiple versions, depending on what you need. It has also multiple profiles for gaming/work etc. which make it to not consume almost any CPU cycles!It won multiple awards and has one of best detection ratios! One of best AV solutions out there, if not the best! Even no antivirus will protect you against all stuff. It is a great program! And has great behavioral analysis!Sometimes Bitdefender will block some legit program and even creating exception for it under each component won't help. But you can contact support and they will usually fix it like in 5 days. Even it doesn't cause many false alarms!I even purchased Total Security, while i had active Internet Security. Because support told me there will be some button at location, where it wasn't. And they changed it for me. So it is extended after a period, my first subscription ends! Instead of replacing my current one. Sometimes support doesn't know where is something  in their program. Because they changed UI like 20 times :DBut: I had only a great experience with their support! They are willing and they will help! And overall. I absolutely recommend it!I bought Total Security on Black Friday for a couple of bucks... Just check their reddit for any codes."
Guest,2,5,"I have been a Bitdefender customer for some years now. I needed my 2 subscription merged into one. I decided to use the chat. Only waited for minute and I couldn’t fault the agent I chatted to in any way. Very friendly, professional and helpful. My requested was sorted within minutes. I am one Happy Customer. Best product"
Ian Goodwin,1,5,"Needed customer support for the first time, friendly efficient, solved my problem with minimum fuss."
Lisa P,1,1,"After days of looking at reviews of anti virus, etc, brands, I purchased BitDefender.  (It never occurred to me to look up customer complaints before purchase).  On the purchase website page, there was NO transaction number, just a thank you for your purchase and an email will be sent straight away with an activation code.  So, I check for that email for 30 minutes.  I get nervous and begin searching through bitdefender website and ALL their tiny print.  I find that in the rare exception, it may take up to 24 hours to receive this activation email.  But, in the mean time I can download their free trial until my email comes.  What?  Aren’t trials 30 days??  I don’t want a trial, I want my product.  (especially at the risk of being double billed later).   So, I continue poking around their website and manage to find a page that says it will look up my order information.  I enter my credit card number with the email addy I used to make my purchase.  That click takes me to a page with “my” purchase number.  Cool!  Oh, wait,,, AND the comment, “OK Order complete. All products/services have been delivered.” (I’m taking a lot of screen shots throughout my entire process). Well, “product” has NOT been delivered. It’s from this page, though, that I need a stopping point.  Feed pets, make life decisions... A few more hours go by and still no activation email.   So, now I want to speak with someone about this activation email.  Should be easy.  Especially, with allll the mentions and icons throughout bitdefender’s website about 24/7 support.  People support.  Speak to a person about “my” issue.  Well, there isn’t any.  And I mean NO support of any kind.  It’s the “shell” game.  Click on this icon, tab, heading, or topic only to be taken to the same nonexistent help recommendations again and again.  It is the truest definition of “run around”.  Oh, and I can’t send them an email because none is listed.  I can’t open a “ticket” for service help because I don’t have my activation email for the code I have to enter for their system to accept my inquiry.  Yeah, runaround SCAM.  Well, after 16 hours and no email from bitdefender, I decide to look up BBB.  And internet search “bitdefender scam”, etc.  Wow!  What a mess!  Now, after an hour plus of reading through people’s reviews of the SAME problems, I used the BBB website to file a complaint.  And now, I’m here doing same.  So to be clear - I have zero recourse to contact bitdefender.  Nada.  Zilch.  They sucked up my money just fine and now are hiding behind a scam that needs to be exposed.  This just occurred to me - I have shopped online since it’s been possible.  Only had one purchase that was scammed (worked out through my bank).  Shopped big companies and small.  Some were tiny upstarts.  I ALWAYS received a confirmation number or transaction number AND email IMMEDIATELY.  If Bitdefender can’t even get out an auto email response, or get their anti virus wares to one paying customer, how can they possibly get millions of updates and coverages to millions of customers???  Bitdefender needs to fall.Edit:  to post this review, I need to enter a code number that Trustpilot emails to me.  I RECEIVED THIS EMAIL INSTANTANEOUSLY!  ...just sayin’..."
Paul Radford,2,5,"I've had a great experience with bitdefender, constantly watching my devices, alerting me to issues and even providing photo evidence of incorrect log in's.A good range of devices are supported and enough devices on my package to protect both myself and my wife.They also provide VPN service, though personally I already have a purchased VPN, so not used it.Customer services is second to none, with 24hr chat based support. Any issues that cannot be dealt with there and then are escalated and  bitdefender will contact in a very quick timeframe, helping to sort any issues within a speedy timeframe.I would recommend considering bitdefender."
Jurgen de Jong,2,5,"Light running, very compleet package.Including VPN, though I run the premium VPN.Additional I run the digital identity protection.Can't come up with a downside."
Emmanuel Frimpong,9,5,Bitdefender is always on hand to deal with any annoying security concerns that you are likely to encounter in your surfing life. Rest assured.
paul,1,4,"Got into it in a hurry when I was not able to use the box. WAS unaware of the extra charges such as install and the modules which were nice but extra. Should be  one fair price in the 80 dollars range and no more charges to ""add"" other feartures. Have never seen another program do it this way."
Jeremy Dahl,2,1,"I paid $64.19 for premium Bitdefender total security. I installed it on my phone and my laptop. The premium subscription transferred to my laptop and works fine. My phone was stuck on the 14day trial and kept trying to upsell me the product I just bought and paid for. I contacted customer service six times. Their fix was to log out and log back in. Never worked. Finally the last service member informed me I was signed up on the 14 day trial. Yeah, dumbass, that's the problem I am talking about. I unsubscribed and paid for Kaspersky."
Customer,4,5,Everything went pretty good with the only exception was I has some trouble with the language barrier. Had to ask the person three time to understand what he was saying.
Jimmy Webster,1,5,
ANTONIO FERNANDES,9,5,A very helpful and efficient service in guiding me to install their antivirusprogram onto my computer.I found their Customer care service to be excellent. Their follow up instructions was easy to understand in the installation of their antivirus.
Elvis Ridgeback,2,5,"As usual, Bitdefender support was very timely and answered the pre-purchase questions I had regarding potential conflicts arising from antivirus attached to a new router mesh system and Bitdefender Total Security which I have run for many years."
Parthiban Karunanithi,1,5,
Paul,1,5,I needed to know if I could purchase Your product now and activate it later since I still had protection for another 277 days. I was told I had three years. Guess Who is Happy. These days we need a break and Bitdefender came to the rescue. It's on sale Now.
Cristi C.,1,5,"Great product, professional service"
Milton Dudley,2,5,"Bitdefender total security is a very excellent security software for your system. But with the new upgrade I wish they did not remove the widget which provided information about the status of your security without needing to go into the app. other than that I would recommend it, very good price for long term security with lots of tools to use and very good total security for all platforms."
Paul Wiesner,1,5,Bitdefender has the best tech support in the business and it is 24/7 which was unheard of with other products back in the day. This last issue was handled after several emails but each response was sent to me in a timely fashion and I was given 2 ways to handle my issue.  I highly recommend Bitdefender.
jvilla,1,5,I use in 5 pcs and I have not any problem
J.,1,5,"This product was recommended me by a friend many years ago. Since that time I keep using it and have already recommended it to my family. Everytime I had questions, the support team was there for me and solved every single problem. So I can totally recommend it to everyone who wants to protect his devices from malware and phishing-scams."
Nick Paulley,2,1,"the software auto renewed without my authorisation and the option to cancel the auto renewal has been removed from bitdefender centralbut the ""help"" instructions to customers has not been updated so it still refers to a missing part of bitdefender centralI am very unhappy that they have taken nearly £90 without giving me the option of cancelling and I am now struggling to get a refundit's absolutely appalling"
Peter Øberg Jensen,24,5,Always a solution to my rare problems. Can only be recommended.
Tarek,1,5,"After a decent survey and testing the product for a 1-month trial I decided to purchase it.I was a using Bitdefender long time ago then switched to other products that are not bad, but I had an offer from Bitdefender which encourage me to purchase."
Angelo Granzotti,1,5,"I have only very good words to say about Bitdefender software ( I am an Electrical Engineer and have worked in the computer field for over 50 years), as for the tech support, it is superior to anything I have ever experienced with any tech support groups."
William,1,5,Bitdefender are online everyday doesn't matter where you are and day we are...
Michel S,2,5,Bitdefender updated itself to Bitdefender 2020 and was asking for details I did not understand. I sent a customer support request. In less than 10 minutes I had received a reply and solved the issue. Very friendly and patient.
Simon,2,5,"I have Bitdefender on all my systems from phone to desktop both on Android & iOS. All the apps work, the system stops the problems and I certainly feel a lot more secure in all my online business as a result."
E. Strodl,8,5,"BITDEFENDER plauditI have used Bitdefender for a number of years now. Their products, whilst innovative, have been continually developed over the years to counter act the ever evolving threats that are circulated on the internet. I believe it is the best product of its type on the market, plus you have a superb support hub who are ever present to give you advice any queries you run into.I have no affiliation with the company, I just feel their products and service is of the highest order."
Paul Tremonti,1,5,"This company has been around since I started using a PC in 1996. All of my peers(3D/Modeling/prototyping/engineering/programmers, etc.), are world wide and they all go with Bitdefender. This is why I use it. These woman and men are top tiered professionals and really love the work they do and because they do, they go all out and learn as much as they can about their jobs and beyond them. They know that the broader there knowledge the better they will be as a person, which leads into better employees and employers. I look at them as working towards perfection, knowing they will not be perfect, but understand that the striving for perfection, is perfection. Hope that makes sense. As a last say, don't complain to them or any developers for what they do, because you maybe the one with the problem, which will lead you into getting angry. Don't forget, first be angry with yourself, so, you don't get angry with them. Have a wonderful forever!"
Cynthia Bounehme,1,5,"The service received by the CALL was better than email support. He was informative, knowledgeable and went outside the normal information required to ensure Bitdefender Security serves all home and business needs."
Sylvain-marc Girard,1,5,"I didn't have any issue, only a question.  But they have been quick to answer it.  Also, my previous communications with them months/years ago have always been satisfying."
BEZAN NASCO,3,5,"everything as expected, top service and light application doing its job"
Anne McLaughlin,1,5,Promptly answered my email and solved my problem.
Charlene Khinberg,1,1,"Their product was pure disappointment and annoyance. I do not recommend them, the price they charge you is so far away from what they deliver.I was tired of having pop-ups from the free software I used, so I bought BitDefender AntiVirus. Although priced at over 100EUR per year, they still have annoying pop-ups you can deactivate a maximum of 48 hrs until they reappear. Although it seems their AV leaves you with high customisation, that is not the case. It's very difficult (or impossible altogether) to turn certain settings off. The default settings the programme comes with are blocking your computer from doing things, not malware. It felt as if the antivirus blocked me out of my computer more than a potential fraudster. My (quite powerful) PC was starting to have weird hiccups that were gone after I uninstalled the Bitdefender software.I consciously picked not to auto-renew a subscription. Yet, one year later, I supposedly have, and I had to manually change that, in a very inconvenient way.All in all, their software is not user-friendly and annoying and their way of forcing customers to stay is incredibly disappointing. There are cheaper options by other providers that cause you less headache."
Mr Robert Burns,3,5,Bitdefender reinstalled feeling secure on the internet happy with the service
Alexandru Bute,2,1,"I am a paying customer for over a year, after having Avast before. Bitdefener has discontinued the Vault service which was encrypting my personal files and I CANNOT get my files back, their customer service is just giving me homework to do like I am their employee and basically they didn't tell me about discontinuing the service includied in my paying abo and NOW I CANNOT GET MY FILES BACK! If this it to be trusted as a service provider for something as sensible as personal data, then you are in for a really bad shock. I completely have not been helped by them, I am still without my files and I completely DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE!!!!!!"
Richard Saunter,4,5,The system is one of the best backed with excellent support.
Angie,2,5,"I am a little technically challenged so I paid for the extra installation package. Totally worth it. They made the process easy and dealt with glitches during the installation process that I otherwise would not have known how to deal with.  Bitdefender product is easy to use, great customer service and tech team."
Dan,78,1,The software has slowed my Mac and caused it to crash 3 times. It also installs its own VPN which I do not want.The more I use this software the more I regret buying it. When it is updating everything else on my mac stops working. It is not protecting me against autofill phishing. I was using the free Avast for years and never had any problems with it.
Jørgen Bager,15,5,among proction programs you do not find anything better and safer than bitdefender
Anastasios,1,1,"Be very careful with them, their products are set to autorenew at standard price and not the discount they offer you for the first year. About 1 month prior to the expiration of the subscription, a super annoying pop-up screen appears every single time you open the internet browser. Press the wrong spot by accident and - oh my God,  you got billed!Many people had similar experiences with BitDefender, if you care to check them out you'll have to look it up at cnet's website, under the path /forums/discussions/bitdefender-scams/"
Susan,1,5,Very helpful and knowedgeable. I did have a little hard time understanding him because of his accent. He had to repeat several times.
Yana Simpson,4,5,I’ve used BitDefender for years and have always found it excellent. Support is available and it’s fast and efficient. Can’t fault the product..it just works!
Paul Green,2,1,"I have cancelled this payment as I am not satisfied with your service. When I purchased this product I changed the settings so that the renewal was manual. When I downloaded the product I was asked to accept the terms and conditions that you sent me. These terms and conditions stated that the renewal of this product was automatic and there was nothing I could do to change that, so I stopped the download, removed the product and have asked paypal to refund me the money you have taken from me. Looking at some of the reviews on trustpilot I see that this appears to be something that you do a lot, what gives you the right to insist that I accept automatic renewal when I do not wish to?"
David Otto,4,5,"This company has great customer service. I had requested a refund because apparently I signed up for auto renew. I had found a Black Friday online sale for half of what they usually charge. I paid $45 and it's normally $90 per year. Then they hit my credit card for $90 and I wrote to them explaining the deal I had just gotten and I don't want to pay double for the same thing I have now. So in a unanticipated move, instead of refunding my $90 they extended the service for 3 more years. I have Bitdefender 'Total Security' which is their best protection at $135 for 4 years of computer security. That is more valuable than the refund I wanted IMO. If I were to pay full price for 4 years of this same computer protection it would be $360, and that's with no possible price increase that could happen in the next 4 years. To add to it the computer security is a premium product and in the last year that I had it I experienced no problems either from the product or malicious computer attacks of which it is has stopped several."
Sandro,4,5,"Renewed my bitdefender but it did not carry over the remainder of my time left. Rang customer service, they fixed it immediately. Great product, great service, would recommend bitdefender to anyone."
Calvin Arthur Richmond Jr.,4,5,"Bitdefender is an awesome Internet Security product.  It works well in the background and does not hog resources.  Bitdefender support is polite, professional, and knowledgeable."
Alberto,1,5,They have a Great Costumer Service and the software is easy to use and top grade protection!
Ken Charlish,1,5,I had difficulty installing Bitedefender on my new tablet and telephone.  The service reps gave me options and helped me solve my issues.
Ethel,1,5,I was charged twice for the same product by accident. Bitdefender replied to my email promptly and the problem was quickly sorted and a refund organized. I have been using Bitdefender for many years and fully recommend it thank you
EricNL,1,5,Doesn't slow down performance of my 8 year old homebuild computer. After the last update there was a little problem and with 1 email and 1 solution the problem was solved. Very reliable product and support. I'm useing it since 2014
STB,2,5,Bitdefender doesn't impact on the performance of my PC as much as some other internet security applications.  It has an 'Auto-Pilot' mode.  It is relatively easy to navigate and has a host of features/utilities like the OneClick Optimizer.  I would definitely recommend Bitdefender to anyone.
Andy C,2,5,"The best security software on the market. I highly recommend them for all your security needs. I've not gotten a virus, malware or any inappropriate software bug in the 3 years I've used them. I can't say that about other competitive software companies as I was constantly infected. Bitdefender is the best for a reason!!"
John Smith,1,1,"i purchased bit defender total security for 2020. the vpn slowed my computer so much that i had to turn it off. when it came up for renewal i had NO intention of purchasing it again. bit defender automatically renewed itself without my permission. as of the time i am posting this review i have not been able to get them to cancel the service and credit back the $96.00 they charged to my account. paypal has also not been any help at all in getting this resolved. you would think a company in the business of protecting your security i.e. money would not be so eager to steal from their customers. what kind of message does that send. i hope 10,000 people read this review and inturn each tell 10 other people. BEWARE BEFORE BUYING BITDEFENDER, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BLEED YOUR ACCOUNT AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT."
Al Mastrocola,1,5,"I have had nothing but good responses for support on an issue, or questions.  User interface is easy to use.  I have been with Bitdefender for over 3 years and I very much depend on it."
Michael Ullrich,2,4,"I have never experienced any virus or malware problems while using Bitdefender. Only thing that seems to be a problem now and then is when it does something in the background and uses a lot more of the computer resources, thus slowing down my computer. I have an i5 older gen processor, but plenty of SSD room."
Nabeel Mirza,6,1,Bitdefender's bdservicehost causing the laptop to overheat by excessive use of RAM and CPU usage. I contacted the technical service and provided all the logs (twice) as requested but after days and days of constant requests and no resolution I have no choice but to uninstall Bitdefender and install an alternative antivirus.
L K,1,5,I've used Bitdefender for 3 or 4 years now.  I've used several other security products in the past and have been the happiest with Bitdefender.  I find it to be the least obtrusive and yet it has provided excellent protection for several computers we have it installed on.  I can largely install it and forget it.  Which is exactly what I'm looking for.
Pete Stopka,1,5,"I trust Bitdefender. I do I.T. for a living. I don't want to come home to my PC and have to worry about virus' and such. I am confident that BD has my back. Footprint and resources are important too, and BD is not a resource hog."
Linda,1,5,"I have been a member since 2015, I am not very computer literate so their directions on how to fix a problem are sometimes over my head. (I'm short so it doesn't take much) but when I talk to a technician they are patient and walk me through the procedure I need to complete the taks."
Richard Gable,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for over a year.  Easy to install on both of my computers.  When I replaced one computer the transfer to the new one was seamless.  I find the notification section helpful in alerting me to potential problems and for needed updates.  The ability to control who has access to my microphone and camera is essential and works very well.  The two times I had to contact customer support, the team was prompt to reply and worked me through the issues."
RIchard Garneau,2,5,I have been using BitDefender for over a year.  I am a very active internet user in sites all over the place and I have NEVER had an issue.
Ericka Glenn,2,5,"I have been very happy with Bitdefender. I get updates when they stop possible threats, and I feel secure in knowing that my online privacy is protected. Thank you!"
Brent Maiden,1,5,Since signing up for Bitdefender I have had no issues with viruses.  My computer runs flawlessly.  I highly recommend it.
Robert Wellcoat,16,5,"I have used this product for some years now and have been trouble free,I have on one occassion had to contact the help line who resolved the matter quickly. A very high quality product."
Dale Pilgrim,8,3,"Generally good service, however I do fine that following updates I can find that there are some issues with my PC. Following my most recent update I find that Windows updates has been switched off. this happens each time I use my PC. I am able to rectify this each time it happens, however some people wouldn't know how to do this basic task so this could leave them vulnerable. Bitdefender, you need to sort this please.Other than this, I'm happy with my product."
RS,5,5,Used for several years easy to install and use and great customer service ie: I renewed by mistake and thought i might be charged twice got an e mail from them telling me that it had been spotted and no charge would be taken First Class
Michael,23,5,Easy and effective MS10 security
DMK,1,5,"Bitdefender's customer service personnel are incredibly knowledgeable, patient and helpful.  Thanks!"
Andrew Becker,1,5,"Affordable, fast scans, great protection. The software and programs don't bog down your computer or annoying pop up whenever you boot up. As good as any other security software for a fraction of the cost."
Barry Craft,1,5,It's very simple.  Bitdefender works and it works great.  A friend built my PC about 4 years ago and he suggested a producted I had never heard of.  He said it was the best thing he had found.  That product was BITDEFENDER.  In four years I have never had even a hint of a virus.  It is a great thing to know that my PC is protected by Bitdefender
Mr Howard-Jones,5,5,"I am now in my second year of using Bitdefender after previously using anti-virus free-ware and being recommended to this product by a friend.In using Bitdefender it has proved to be an excellent programme, it auto-updates and runs in the background silently and without interruptions to what-ever I am doing at the time. I do play games regularly such as flight simulation which requires a lot of resources if running full full graphics but Bitdefender does not affect any of these programmes and allows you to play without interruptions whilst keeping me safe.I have no hesitation in recommending this product."
Brian,9,5,"I have used many 'anti-virus' packages and Bitdefender has proved to be the simplest to install, update and with no impacts as I have worked. A first class package"
Nancy Birkelien,3,5,I feel very safe with Bitdefender.  I have not had any issues since becoming a Bitdefender user.  I receive updates and notifications and trust that all my data and information is safe.
Charles,4,5,Works great. Stays in the background. Easy interface when needed.
Paulo Henrique,1,5,Very good and reliable antivirus. The only thing missing is some extra options on the context menu when right clicking the task bar icon.
colin smith,15,5,Bitdefender give me reassurance that my computer is safe from cyber attack and similar intrusions.
Katherine Russell,2,5,Challenge was ending up with two subscriptions. Situation resolved to mutual satisfaction.
Christopher Jijita,1,5,"Bitdefender is an exceptional entity which protects you and your system seamlessly. It blocks everything that can put you and your system in danger, I t Is The best."
Greg Whaley,1,4,"I'm happy with this product and the way it works in the overall scheme of things but, as they say, there's an issue. The product scans, detects, blocks all the things it should and seems to offer good protection all around. The but comes in when it comes to recognizing my home wi-fi system. The suite just doesn't see it and won't allow me to search for it. I submitted a ticket on this issue through customer support the day after installing the product, so 11-27-20 and to date the issue hasn't been addressed and no further correspondence. So other than these couple of issues I'd say it's a good product and worth buying. If they addressed these issues, fixed them and in a timely manner, I would have rated it 5*."
Punisher Dracula Von's,2,5,"Top Notch and trustworthy, I loved it!I recommend to buy it during gold November for cheaper and during checkout remove autopay then you will get prompt out to keep same price for next renewal, with love to Romania :)"
John Burke,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for 10 years with outstanding results. I have run a computer club in the past and told all to buy it. I've have it on 3 machines for 8 years. Whenever the discussion of antiviruses comes up, I always expound the benefits of Bitdefender like SAFEPAY, VPN and RANSOMWRE PROTECTION. This is one OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!"
Jack Pisano,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for the past 3 years.  It was very easy to use and to renew on all three of my computers.  I feel very safe with Bitdefender and I especially like the Safepay resource.
Fox,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for a year now and it is super easy to use, it does not slow down your system, keeps it clean and you can do all you need to online safely. I highly recommend it!"
Steven Moore,15,5,I have used Bitdefender products for many years now and find that they offer unrivalled protection.  I never experience the effects of malware or viruses and feel totally secure in my use of the internet for both business and personal purposes.
William Brenner,7,5,"What do I want from this security Bitdefender software.I want complete trust in the software programme.I want ease of use.I want a simple easy to operate user interface.I want clarity.I want reliabilityI want the maximum level of automated protectionI want software with an affordable price tag.When I first purchased Bitdefender, I was sceptical to say the least, as every other security software I've ever purchased has not even matched 50% of this Bitdefender product. To my amazement, it actually works as I wanted it too and it ticked all my boxes. 'Rock-on' Bitdefender"
C,3,5,"I have Bitdefender on several devices. Bitdefender makes for great internet security. On my android and Kindle devices the app is low-impact. On my computer Bitdefender is thorough. There is the occasional false positive, but that is usually due to blocking file types that usually have a reputation for containing malicious software. In any case, I high recommend Bitdefender for all devices and operating systems."
Ronny Geenen,2,5,"In the old days I had tried several free anti virus systems. Not one made me happy. I started reading about and comparing the different products. The result: I am using Bitdefender already for many years. Especially today a person needs a best protection. Also with your VPN, I, being a Dutch person living in the US, are able to bypass the blockage of the Dutch TV programs."
Beatrice,5,5,"super service, fast and efficient"
Divyansh,2,5,"Bitdefender Total security was an absolutely awesome product at an amazing value. It integrates all major components of device care ,so you don't need to install tons of software seperately (bringing older devices to their knees). Vpn, anti-malware and system speedup via registry and startup optimization. Its just complete in every sense."
David J,21,5,"I have been with Bitdefender for quite a few years with no problems, so I had no hesitation in renewing my subscription when it came up.Good system, keep me clean, reasonable price. Well done Bitdefender"
Patrick Habegger,3,3,"The product itself is great, have been using it for years without issue. The yearly renewal came up in October and I decided to buy a key on G2A, for the first time. Entered the key, successful activation.But then a few weeks later, I went in to check something on the dashboard and noticed that Bitdefender wasn't active anymore. So I went on to Chat and discovered that the key had been revoked 3 weeks prior, without ANY form of communication to me. Meaning me and my family were unprotected for a period without even realising it.If they didn't like the key then that's their internal decision but why accept it in the first place? I did eventually get a refund from G2A who are, and I quote Bitdefender, 'an unofficial reseller and anyone could see the key on the their website'. To just cut me off, well, it's disappointing and not what I would've expected from Bitdefender.Probably going to go to another product now."
Andrew,1,5,"Apologies, this it quite long, I'm just... pretty impressed, actually.I assumed being that my problem was with the free version of Bitdefender Anti Virus, and possibly more a Windows 10/me problem, I wouldn't get much help and that I was facing the prospect of having to reinstall Windows 10. Me of - um - little faith, I guess?TLDR version - customer service - thanks Alex D - responded to my email in less than a day, at the weekend, with politeness, friendliness, patience and great tone, keeping me calm - and a good result.Long version, below. Hope it helps someone.I'd had to do a Windows 10 system restore because of a problem with a Paragon product that I couldn't cleanly uninstall and, having done so, decided to DISM and SFC and uninstall my anti virus software and, you know, do a clean install of it, in case there had been a subsequent Bitdefender product update, but unfortunately, after the System Restore, and possibly because I'd uninstalled the anti virus program prior to running system restore (Windows system restore sometimes won't work even if you disable your third party anti virus, where, as Microsoft advise and as I found, temporarily uninstalling it can) the system restored to an earlier state, Bitdefender free antivirus didn't, this time, fully uninstall a second time.Unfortunately Bitdefender uninstall tool didn't, in my case, help, (the Bitdefender Anti Virus installer wouldn't let me reinstall; error message: ""install error cannot copy installer""). I carefully manually removed a few Bitdefender files and registry entries but unfortunately Bitdefender Anti Virus free version still wouldn't reinstall. I even tried installing a trial of their paid-for suite but, again, the installer kept throwing up that error message.Customer service got back to my email well within a day - thanks ""Alex D"", if you read this, you know who you are - he got me to use a diagnostic tool which was very straightforward to use, you wouldn't, I felt, need to be computer savy to use it. He made some clear and helpful suggestions based on the report file that I sent as an email attachment.Within a couple of emails, I was back up and running. And this for a free product? And okay, I appreciate that it pays to help people who might then go on and invest in your services, right? but that's kind of the point, they - Alex, really polite and kind, it can't be easy to be a customer service agent - helped me, they have gained my trust, on this one. So, trustpilot wise, I think I would purchase a more fully featured paid-for Bitdefender product/service at some point, is my two pence. Customer service is important to me. Product wise, I can only go by the free AV but I haven't felt the free version was slowing my computer down, which aside from the great reviews was one reason that I wanted to reinstall it, the interface is minimalist and simple. Once registered, which just took a minute or two, there was no pop up, as far as I can recall, trying to sell me things with superlative-worded popup ads, free gifts that aren't fee and all that crap (one definite way to put me off).I think good faith means quite a lot to this company and the reason I think that is, for instance, though the Bitdefender Uninstaller tool (which okay, probably wasn't designed with 'just' the free version of the anti virus program in mind) that I found under my own searching on their site, didn't work for me, it didn't just unhelpfully say 'error'; it specifically told me to contact Bitdefender on how to remove what was left' - and customer service delivered on that. I can't remember if the tool gave me a contact address but I found the support email address on their forum (sorry, this site won't let me post an email address).Your mileage may vary and all of that but I was very impressed/relieved and I hope this helps someone.Too much to get stressed about, these days, so excuse the gush, I'm relieved, reinstalling Windows 10 and a lot of apps, though of course straightforward and sometimes a clean install, having backed everything up, is desireable, but it isn't my idea of a good time, these days, too time consuming, so big thumbs up, thanks Bitdefender folks. Many thanks Alex."

Nick,23,2,"Absolutely dreadful. I am so shocked at how bad the service has been, including with 'support'. I regret my order so much I am afraid."
GP,1,5,"I recently took advantage of the Cyber Monday offers as a good opportunity to extend and upgrade my subscription.I ended up with two subscriptions, due to my false understanding, and with a 90 days overlap of the subscriptions.BitDefender Customer Service, not only shown a great understanding of my problem, at no point did they blame it on me (which they could), and on top of the above, they merged the two subscriptions, adding the 90 days I had from the old subscription on top of my newly bought subscription."
Lewis Young,1,4,BD support staff provided suggestions that helped resolve the problem.
Tracy Verlin,5,5,the besttHE vERY beSTCovers my complete network and gets almost everything at the router level.You cant ask for more.

David Fleming,1,5,"My computer was infected with Marquis malware.  Bitdefender sent me a link for them to obtain information about my computer, then a few days later I received the steps to take to successfully remove the malware."
J F H,3,5,"I find Bitdefender really good, never had a problem since I’ve been using it, easy to use, set up and great customer service."
HOWARD B,5,2,I purchased the Bitfender 5 device licence to use on my PC and mobiles phones.I have been happy with the product on the PC. However this does not work on my mobile phone when using Vodafone 4G. This makes it a bit pointless as a mobile application.i did contact Bitfender about the issue who said it was my phone providers fault and I should contact them to ask why. Poor response as far as I am concerned & I will be looking for a new provider when the current licence expires
TAT,2,5,Good product (Bitdefender Total Security) with good customer support if needed. Only negative in my opinion is the somewhat confusing renewal process.
Edgar Dominguez,1,5,"Great product, very good price, great client support"
robaer,2,5,"this app is most privacy and safe app i every seen, i love options, the prices is little bit expensive, but actually i was waiting black friday, and i already purchased in perfect offer, tottaly 5 stars or more even"
Danielle Crossfield,18,5,"A beautifully crafted, light and a well-maintained app with great customer support. Very impressed so far."
D.A.S.,4,5,"I have been with Bitdefender for many years and not had a single problem with viruses/malware.It's easy to use, unobtrusive and extremely effective.The after-service is excellent and very helpful.It's the best available.I have recommended it to family and acquaintances based on my personal experiences with it."
Michel Fizzano,1,5,"Very satisfied with the product: it does what it is supposed to do, which is protect you very securely from every online threats while working in the background in a non intrusive way. Add to that a fast and friendly support to all my past queries, and you understand the reason why I've been with BitDefender services for over 10 years now, and will definitely go on with them."
mativa nosurname,4,1,"Don't use.The service includes an automated renewal of the subscription, which in my case was more than 3x as expensive as the original subscription.Fradulent: upon login on your user account at bitdefender.com, no mention of such automated renewal is visible, nor is it possible to change any subscription parameters.I could find two instructions on how to change subscription parameters online, both written by bitdefender.com. None of these were possible to execute, as the options mentioned in the instructions are just not there in the user account.Edit after Bitdefenders answer to this review:I can not confirm this statement of Bitdefender: ""The autorenewal option can anytime be managed from your Bitdefender Central account..."""
R. Everett,2,5,I made a mistake when purchasing my new Bitdefender product and used a new email address when my current product was installed using my old email address. I was a bit panicked because I figured I really made a mistake. The employees at Bitdefender fixed my mistake without a problem and without hesitation!!!!
Benjamin Pace,4,1,BEWARE THEY TRY AND SCAM YOU WITH A £70 RENWAL WHEN YOU BUY AND YOU CANT REFUND
Chuck,1,5,"I didn't spot the activation code in the emails I received after purchase. After contacting them I found the code in very fine print on one of the emails and finished activating BitDefender. The response was within an hour after I contacted them and minutes after I activated the product (which they noticed I had already done). So far, after a few hours it has been running great!"
G WEBB,6,5,I have had Bitdefender for almost five years and in all that time have felt confident that we have the best protection. I chose Bitdefender on the basis of the excellent reviews and we have not been disappointed. With conducting so much business on line these days it is essential to protect yourself and we are confident that Bitdefender offer that protection.
Marek Fuchs,1,5,People who work in Bitdefender Support Center are very helpful in solving any problem you might have! :-) I'm definitely happy with the way my problem was solved!
Crystal Ratcliffe,2,5,"I got the long 90 special trial which was priceless as I am on SSDI and it allowed me to save money. I also used the product for 86 days. Today I was able, due to the black Friday sale, to get the family plan and the Premium VPN for less than the Family plan alone. This was magnificent! I did research and found it was one of the top recommended and when loaded, it found hidden viruses my previous antivirus had missed for more than a year! Within a day my system was running smoothly and cleanly and I can see exactly what it is blocking. It also found and help me eliminate the rclick virus that embedded itself in my chrome, and stopped all its attempts to connect to the internet! What's best is that anytime I have any problem or technical issue, I call the tech line and they help me and are professional, and patient and get the problem handled. I am sold ad just sign ed up for a year and recommending it to all my friends"
Mathew Abraham,4,5,Excellent software - have been using them for the last four years.  Keeps my computer very safe.  The price is very competitive and the 24 hours customer telephone support is very good!
Alex,9,5,"Great product at a competitive price...sometimes you get what you pay for and in this instance with Bitdefender I can highly recommend the product. Been with them for years, no other anti virus product beats it"
Seriously...?,3,1,"Bitdefender is a great product ...BUT??? - AUTO-RENEWALShould I really have to involve Customer Care every renewal date to try and cancel auto-renewal when the following support page instructions are wrong???'You can cancel the auto-renewal option at any time from your Central account.    Sign into Bitdefender Central.    Select the My Subscriptions section in the sidebar.    Access My Payments.    Click the name of your Bitdefender product.    Click Manage your subscription renewal options.    Press STOP AUTO-RENEWAL.'Every year, this is the only TEDIOUS, TIME CONSUMING and FRUSTRATING thing about Bitdefender and a simple fix that can be done by  just including a option button on Bitdefender Central."
Trevor Craig,5,5,As a not too techy computer user the recommendations from the trade experts and my previous experience this was a no brainer to renew....
Swethaa Ramamurthi,2,5,I am very happy to have purchased Bitedefender and I have been a customer for almost a year and have now renewed it for the second year. Great Support too!
Luke,1,4,"All of my experiences with Bit defender so far have been great! All save the fact I can't use it's products or services on my Linux PC, would love to see that added!"
GEORGE M. PIERIDES,22,1,"Bitdefender asked me to close the Dispute case,and they said that they would fully refund me, as soon they have the document from PAY-PAL,about the confirmation of the closing of my disposal case!I tried to  make the trust to them,but PAY-PAL says the following:Once this case is closed,you can't report another issue on this transaction!If you are expecting a refund or a replacement from the seller,we RECOMMEND THAT you CLOSE this CASE AFTER you RECEIVE it!Excuse me but nobody will be WEALTHIER with just another 33 Euro!I am deeply sorry, but you FULLY DISAPPOINTED ME!!!TRUST COSTS MORE THAN A FEW EUROS!!!Waiting for your FULL REFUND this week, no more DELAY!I have all your E-mails, as Proof!There is no need to refer to CONSULTING AGENCIES,to solve a single and cheap problem,like this one!TRUST TO BE TRUSTED!How do your friends in digitallife.com.cy explain to the people this inconvenience dispute problem?MARKETING DOESN'T WORK, IN THIS WAY!Make people trust you!Blessings and Greetings!If you don't solve this unnecessary issue by the end of the week, I WILL REMIND PAY-PAL AGAIN,next Monday morning!Warm Regards!Remember : Christmas is coming, open your hearts!I WILL CONTINUE WITH MY DISPUTE!PLEASE REFUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,without delay!"
Adam Church,1,4,"I feel safe with Bitdefender. The program has many options and safety points that give you a good sense of security. And it is reasonably priced compared to other products available at this time. Customer service was good. Not the best, however definitely not the worst. I was satisfied. My only complaint is that I had difficulty installing. I was installing from a trial version and other products it is seamless. You hit a buy now tag and boom. Done. Bitdefender on the other hand didnt do that. Well actually, the VPN was flawless. The rest was a pain and customer service was called. An hour later, it is working great.  All in all, I would recommend this program."
Sonia Law,14,5,Excellent product no problems to install customer service exceeded all expectations
Debra Lloyd,1,5,"Bitdefender is the best security software, license options provide for multiple devices at a reasonable cost. Support is great but I've only ever needed it to renew/upgrade to add licenses."
iNOVA Group,1,5,The best internet security products and services for my family and me more than 10 years. Thanks!
Julia,23,5,"So far so good! I have had excellent customer service support. The ""live"" chat with a real person was very useful and I was able to resolve the issues I was experiencing. So far the virus protection and VPL are all living up to their promises and expectations! Based on my experience with Bitdefender I will renew my subscriptions annually."
joão alcindo martins e silva,1,4,My Bitdefender VPN device is operating intermittently.I need a new installation.
Andrew,2,5,Bitdefender is quite simply the best antivirus product on the market (and I've tried many!). Their after-sales service is also excellent. Highly recommended!
Claudia Levy,1,5,"I needed reassurance that I was not charged twice, one for the software and the other for having it downloaded for me. As it turns out, I was not charged twice. Just once was I charged and that was for the software.Thanks BitdefenderClaudia L."
Lawrence D Jones,4,5,"This product is a comprehensive anti-virus software.  It is competitively priced and in my opinion, the best on the market."
Denis CC,3,5,"Simply the best protection out there! I believe its my 3rd year using them and I couldn`t be happier. UI is super simple to use, so many features and detailed reports. Customer service is always top notch! Friendly and on point. I remember I made a recommendation once if they can add ""dark mode"" to the UI, next update boom its there! I also bought the VPN deal from them, been using CyberGhost before switching and boooy what a difference in speed!! Super happy with Bitdefender!! Highly highly highly recommended !!"
MARK TAIT,5,5,Had a question regarding renewing the subscription and was very happy with the professional rsponse I received.
Hadi Tabatabaee,1,1,"It is supposed to protect the sensitive information, while Bitdefender stores my credit card information without my permission and share it with other third-party for support. How can you trust these people?"
Iurie Dumbravanu,1,5,"Bought a subscription for 12 months for BTS, not received the activation code. After sending an email to Support - received the code in less than 3 hours! Very fast! Thanks!"
Consumer,1,5,"Customer care is outstanding.These folks know their business inside and out!They have your back covered 24/7/365.Should you encounter any problems, Bitdefender team wastes no time in resolving it."
Susan Parry,4,5,"I have been a happy customer of Bitdefender Total Security for some years.  Yesterday I was going to renew on an offer from Bitdefender via email - to renew for £24.99.  I didn't need to renew as I had 83 days left on my subscription.  However, and email from 2Checkout (Bitdefender authorised vendor) said I was coming to the end of my subscription on 29/11, but I wasn't.  I was about to renew with the offer when an email from 2Checkout stated they had renewed my product at a cost of £69.99!  Furious, as I had disabled auto renewal in my account, but when I checked it was 'Enabled'.  This smacks as dishonest in my book.  I have emailed both Bitdefender and 2Checkout voicing my disgust at this outcome - £45 overcharged.  Bitdefender now shows my account over 400 days subscription until Feb 2022, which proves I was not ready for my annual renewal.  I have requested a full refund or reduce my subscription to £24.99, the offer amount which is still on my email.  UPDATE:  Faith restored in Bitdefender - received an apology for the auto renewal and a refund is to be made and it looks like they have disabled the auto renewal permanently.  I have now taken up their Black Friday discount deal....RESULT!"
Stewart Dale Spencer,1,5,I installed the new Mac OS and it messed up a few things. Bitdefender was not working right but an easy inquiry to Bitdefender support resulted in a quick response and an effective solution.
Happy Consumer,2,5,I have already given my comments about what had transpired earlier in the survey. Suffice to say that everything when smoothly except for never receiving the e-mail with the activation code and had to rely on the Customer Care representative to give me the code over the phone. That is the only thing I was disappointed with. Something should be done to fix that issue for future purchases!!!
Stan Rutland,1,5,This is the very best of this type software and their customer service is the very best.
Valery,2,5,"Great product and very good service. After using two other Antivirus software I feel Bitdefender is the best. Waist not mush computer resources, setup is easy with a lot of options, updates are regular with no problems.Two things to be mentioned:1. Bitdefender does not use Windows notification system. Thus, when a reboot is needed (sometimes after program update, not filters update) you might see it only opening Bitdefender Notification folder, if you decide to...2. Bitdefender does not guarantee all modules will work, if you do not use a latest Windows 10 version. For example, VPN module is not working on my Windows 10 1803 version. All other work well.A standard part of an answer to any problem request contains a line ""Use the latest Windows version"", along with other, more practical suggestions. So, be prepared to be updated with Windows :-)"
Curt G.,1,5,The uninstall Bitdefender utility would not remove all the files. It took me to contact support to get steps to bring up my PC in safe mode with network to get the files removed.
Ryan,2,1,This is a warning about Bitdefender rather than a review.I was about to renew my subscription and discovered...to be quite blunt...they are ripping people off.After chatting with their online rep. I discovered the following:1. I received a renewal notice. Clicked on it. And was taken to a page where my renewal would be $29.99 CAD2. I then went to the main webpage only to discover that the regular price is $24.99 CAD3. After chatting with their online rep. and going to the 2checkout page I discovered that my auto renewal was $59.99 CADSo I of course came to the conclusion this company is no longer getting my business as they are clearly ripping people off.This is flat out wrong. Their rep. kept saying: ...the Billing Platform has no info about the current deals.In today's world with the technology we have this is basic programing. I can see a price difference of a few cents or maybe even a dollar or a typo but $35??? That's unacceptable.Regardless if their software works or not....do not give BitDefender your money.
Ng Zhi Qiang,1,5,"Bitdefender Total Security is a great product, have been using it for more than 3 years. Support was quick and helpful as well even during the current pandemic. Questions asked to resolve issue were on point."
Jaroslav Demeter,1,5,"The best in class security solution. Reliable filtration and solid antivirus. I am feeling safe, because I am very satisfied with the software itself and support team as well."
Emil Karaivanov,1,5,Excellent All-in-one security tool with always helpful and responsive support team.
Ms Walsh,15,5,"This is a good product, easy to use. I ran into an issue and customer support resolved it quickly."
neil chandler,11,5,Have been with Bitdefender for almost 10 years and the service is just PERFECT A real agent to talk to 24/7 not a computer generated system and expert advice every time.

Paddison,9,3,"I had the free version, it was taking an age for full scans, and there didn't seem to be a way to configure it to allow Team Viewer to access the internet, despite searching for answers on the support pages and elsewhere online. None of the ""solutions"" bore any resemblance to what was appearing on my screen when opening the settings page in the programme."
Andrew White,13,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for over 4 years and have never experienced any I.T. security issues. Any query/ issue I have put to the company is dealt with very, very promptly with helpful , accurate guidance to solve my Bitdefender issues."
David Lingard,27,5,"Been with this firm for over 15 years and it's been great, never felt the need to move away. Customer service is rarely needed but is top class when it is."
monsterflix awards,1,5,"Extremely high level of professionalism which is very rare unfortunately! Bitdefender cares about their customer, a very simple philosophy that most people forget today!"
Ron S,1,5,Recent call to Cust Service was required after renewing product. This is usually seamless however I upgraded to Family Plan and added VPN.. After a couple unneeded downloads I best to get help and called Customer Service. Responding gentleman expertly and with precision guided me to a quick solution.. I was left wondering why I didn't simply call sooner..
Dan Erczmann,1,1,"Broken Software. Stops working by itself. Bitdefender support will make you go through a long and tedious process, including installing additional software to record your system every time. Their support have been unable to fix the bugs (including clutter all over your Search and Facebook links) and then refuse to refund, despite the software not working - as the software has stopped working after the 30 day refund period."
Happy Customer,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for several years and throughout that time the products have caught and eliminated every computer threat, and the VPN is great.  I recently renewed my subscription early and accidentally misspelled my email address and did not catch that until after the order was processed.  I contacted Customer Care via the 24hr Chat service and they corrected the problem and got my account all fixed up instantly.  I love the idea that I can renew anytime (especially when the special offers are given) and the renewal is added to extend my current subscription.  Excellent product and fantastic customer service.  I wish all companies were as good as Bitdeffender is. Well done - Thanks."
Mark Nieuwstadt,2,5,The Bitdefender products have no equal and their support is nothing short of amazing.
Rob Roberts,1,5,"Bitdefender has a very good product (Total Security) and more Important, If anything goes wrong- Even better service and support .I'm a part-time NZ Computer/Phone Techie and you get to know who has good products and service. You tell your customers the truth about software and hardware companies...Thank you Bitdefender- Quality all round. > Every time. It's easy to recommend someone who does things properly."
Eva,1,5,"Unlike may companies you call for customer service, his English was perfect!  Thank you!!!  He was extremely knowledgeable about each and every question I asked and made the entire conversation seamless."
Richard,1,5,Bitdefender provides a great product with a competitive price. Their customer support is just a phone call away and the service reps are pleasant and knowledgeable.
T.R.,1,5,"First of all, Bitdefender products are absolutely great! I have been using ""Total Security"" along with ""VPN"" on 3 devices for a while now, and, I have zero complaints! My wife & I are senior citizens that just want total protection 24/7 without having to worry about anything malicious happening to our ""internet lifeline""! We can't say enough GOOD about their direct customer support team either. What a pleasure to have nowadays.....cyberspace worry free protection!!"
k,11,5,"Bitdefender products & support is faultless. Whether you have a general setup query or difficulty, technical or subscription based question, the Bitdefender technician team have all the answers, and that is why, as a return customer, I decided on a three year BDTS subscription. Bitdefender = Trust, Security, Reliability and Consistency. 10/10! Thank you Bitdefender!"
David Hernandez,2,5,
Terry Carroll,1,5,"When I emailed support about the fact that I have multiple licenses for the product and just wanted them rolled into one subscription, the agent understood what I wanted and needed quickly and efficiently. I love Bitdefender and knowing they have a great support system makes me appreciate them even more."
Roy,1,5,All of my concerns were address efficiently and with resolve.
Sarah Robson,3,5,"This company is the best around, I have used multiple services over the years and this outshines all of them. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!"
Ellen Lartz,3,5,I had noticed a trial version of bitdefender software available. I have tried the trial version and will purchase the regular service when my trial period is finished. Great service at a reasonable price !
Bill,2,4,Been using BD for years and the AV programs have been mostly within the top 5 available sometimes the top 10 (depending on which review you read).
Prasanna Kurukuladithya,1,5,"Bitdefender Total Security for a small home is the best Antivirus solution since it protects Windows, Mac OS & iOS up to 5 items.Customer service solves issues efficiently"
Arman,3,2,Does its job with protection BUT....Incredibly intrusive tool Constant popups about suspicious connections - these from ads and good they're blocked but shut the ^*& up about it.Pop ups about using their VPN is annoying too ( I have my own VP) - BitDefender constantly pushes their stuff in your face.Switching to something else after having paid for this junk.Update - your team doesn't understand the difference between application notification and browser notifications!Terrible support to add to the list - avoid!
Patrick,1,5,Excellent protection with minimal impact on system. Easy to use and excellent customer support.
Hreggvidur,4,5,I Had a problem after Update and contacted support and got answer with in 2 days with advice about what to do and it worked.
Linda Glass,3,3,"I prefer to not have auto renewal, but apparently I must.  I can spend less than half the amount if I order myself rather than get autorenewal.  But if I buy myself ahead of time, then I must deal with the autorenewal issues.  I was unsure if autorenewal was disengaged.  At this time, I am not sure if my new service is activated, but I am exhausted today and will hope for the best."
Doug Doyle,1,5,"My router came with Armor, a Bitdefender product. I purchased the subscription after a successful trial, but unfortunately needed to replace the router. The support engineer understood what I needed, and was able to remove the old router from my account, and transfer the subscription in one contact. Very happy with teh product and support. Bitdefender is not resource hungry or intrusive, but is very effective blocking threats."
Peter Boesener,2,5,Bitdefender installation failed on my I-Mac. possibly due to switching from Catalina to Big Sur. One e-mail request for help did resolve the problem with immediate follow-up of expert and patient assistance. Thank you! I- Mac
Chris Duggan,1,5,"Fantastic support team, quick resolution on the issue I needed fixed. I’m very happy with the security I get from Bitdefender!"
Hugh Maxwell,3,5,"Bitdefender (BD)  improving greatly with the way the Customer Service operates. They now have live chat 24/7. They just solved an issue where I was locked out of my account for the 2nd time. The fist time ( before the live chat 24/7 was available)  it took circa 3 days of email back and forth. But this time when I contacted BD ( through live chat) about 10PM, live chat referred the case to Sales. And before I went to bed in about 30 mins time Sales contacted me. When I woke up at after 4AM an email was already in my Inbox asking me for some sort of "" identity verification"". It follows that,  I provided the information and before I get ready for work, I received another email with the issue solved and that the 2FA is now removed, I could now log into my Account. It was my first time using the Live Chat and I must say  I am well pleased. If this quality of customer service was available a few months ago I would be using their VPN service at present; instead of had to ask for a refund for my VPN subscription."
Anonymous,1,5,I had to contact customer service one and they handled it great. Never had any problems with their security software. Great guys.
Katbob,2,5,"Well scans threats. Customer servive is first rate. Cost is fair, particularly at sale price."
Dan Lionel,1,5,"Well, I have been with Bitdefender for probably over a year now, but as always, I withdrew after taking my desktop to the shop, the technical recommended another VPN and antivirus, which I did but I noticed some unusual activity with my device, to the point where my bank account was hacked into and my finances were wiped out. I then unsubscribed from this other guy and attempted to re-enroll with Bitdefender. I encountered some problems initially, until I logged into chats and met with Marian. I explained to him and he just embraced and assure me that it's okay, he will help and so he did.A - agree with God.M - move with God.E - end with God.N - never doubt God."
karam,1,5,"more than ten years with continuous amazing service with full protection, what we need more!"
Tana,2,5,This is the ONLY internet security program I have ever used that I have had zero issues with. It functions perfectly and I've never had any issues with it. The customer help team is always on the ball as well if you have any queries.
David Wylie,1,5,I purchased Bitdefender about a year ago and recently had to contact support for a problem I was experiencing in a browser.  I really thought it was a problem with Bitdefender.  They worked with me steadily over a couple of days until we discovered the an add on that had very stealthily created the problem.  The support team was terrific.
Sonia,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender Total Security for over two years. I would highly recommend it to anyone who like me had severe security issues with your main devise. It's easy to use, can be shared with other people and devises, has a local phone number offering a competent and friendly 24 hours customer support. In a nutshell - I used all the other major brands in the past and came to the conclusion that by far - Bitdefender is simply the best."
Haitham Sweilem,1,5,"Great product and great support.Licensing is easy, affordable and multiplatform. You can purchase one license and use it on 3 (or 5) devices (pc, mac, android, ios).I love their mobile products as well, they contain a lot of important features: parental control, fast background scanning, secret face photos when entering wrong pins, locating devices, wiping device data, and screaming when approaching the location of a lost/stolen device! I didn't know mobiles can scream :)It's also very easy to manage everything through a single dashboard ""Bitdefender Central"". You can see reports, manage devices and their security, share installation links, identity protection...etc.It integrates very well with my Windows machine. It monitors applications which access webcam, microphone, and notifies about that.It is also a leader in the antivirus industry."
thetao,1,5,Great product. You can't go wrong with Bitdefender! Simple as that.
John Wardrop,6,1,"I have a 2020 iMAC with 27"" screen and based on reviews purchased a 3 year subscription to Bitdefender. As a result I have been plagued with (1) random black screen (2) failure to wake up from sleep/ unlock. Having spent considerable time trying to resolve this, isolating printer, scanner etc without any improvement I uninstalled Bitdefender. Hey presto the problem was resolved. I feel very foolish now signing up to the 3 year subscription with Bitdefender!"
Mahir Sahinovic,1,5,My problem was solved in a few minutes! Bitdefender works great and is simple to use.
Barry,3,5,
Ibuddy66,4,4,"I personally can say I love Bitdefender security products.  They are the most efficient, accurate products I've used for cybersecurity.  There are some blips here and there as far as identifying websites with their traffic light feature for search results that fails to recognize some malicious sites.  But, to be fair Google also failed to recognize it first in their search itself, and second in their safe browsing security features.  I just wish there was an easier way on all platforms to submit malicious sites and an explanation of it to Bitdefender to help them more rapidly identify many different threats."
RexTheJack,4,5,"In my opinion, this is the best antivirus on the planet. I just contacted customer services about an error I made, and they are second to none. Excellent service thankyou."
Bogdan Donu,1,5,support team is great. goes with the greatness of their product
NCreviews,7,5,"After trying Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky, Vipre and Bullguard, the only bone I have to pick with BitDefender is the price tag. But needless to say, it's worth every penny/cent.To Expand : Norton and McAfee are system hogs, they slow everything down on the computer and make it overheat (especially with laptops or gaming hardware) and Vipre & Bullguard just don't compete at the same level as Bitdefender does, as for Kaspersky I just don't trust the Russians, especially when it comes to technology (when else did you hear about good software/technology from Russia?) whilst yes they are still in the pro league of security solutions for the average home-user, I found that they were not as feature rich and/or user intuitive. BitDefender has been top of the ranks for a number of years for a good reason."
Gorge,1,5,the customer care is very helpful with regards my concern. and will definitely recommend Bitdefender to my friends since that your personnel is very friendly and professional
tt ez,1,5,
Chuck Jahn,1,5,Bitdefender matched a renewal price. Handled my concerns promptly. Easy to use product and great value.
Carolyn Hill Taylor,1,5,The only difficulty was locating where I submit a ticket.  The support team responded within a couple of days and I was able to resolve my issue without having to contact the team again.  I recommend Bitdefender for protection.
Marsha Small,1,5,Well designed and easy setup software. Support was efficient and knowledgeable.
Robin,1,5,"Overall is good experiences. It's just that there is unsynchronization in expiry date, which happened 2 times already. My account subscription was stopped before the expiry date mentioned in their email notification. I reached Bitdefender customer service using live chat feature in their website, and then they extend my subscription to match the date in their email notification. If they able to prevent the same problem (unsynchronization) happen again in the future, it will be perfect."
Alan Kenly,1,5,"Bitdefender is the best on the marketi have used their products for the last 5/6 years they are outstanding. and they always take on board mine and other customers views importantly.if you are looking for security thats protects you and your family online, Bitdefender is the answer."
customer Liz Davies,3,5,Bitdefender have retained a personal service and interaction with their customers that I do not believe exists elsewhere with globalist corporations.
IAN,5,5,"I was having a problem with Bitdefender and going around in circles trying to resolve it.  A very sketchy description of the problem was sent to their customer support team and I very quickly received a response with details on how to resolve the issue.  After following the instructions, the issue was finally resolved and I am now a happy Bitdefender user."
Frankly Speaking,9,1,"Bitdefender has just done an auto update which has almost functionally trashed my system.As of now I can't write to my Windows documents directory  AT ALL and when I look at the Bitdefender Total Security Protection window, there is no longer a ""Safe Application"" tab which is, according to your website, the ONLY way to turn that EXTRMELY UNWANTED FEATURE off.Having subscribed to their service for a number of years, clearly this utter mess-up by Bitdefender means I will NOT be renewing my subscrition in future years with Bitdefender.  BEFORE they release updates any software provider MUST make sure they don't cause major problems to users.  We buy their software to be protected against problems like ransomeware, not to have Bitdefnder cause them."
John,2,5,"I wanted to know if upgrading at time of renewal was possible and as I couldn't see the answer in FAQs. So I emailed the Customer support centre - within minutes it seemed I had a reply. I then asked for clarification, coupled with a further question and they answered that quickly too - even making my future renewal simpler in the processVery impressed by the speed and friendliness of all contact."
Ian,2,5,"I had a query regarding extending my subscription for this excellent product, and received a prompt reply and solution despite it being Sunday afternoon"
raphaël van damme,2,5,"Practical, professional including dedicated follow-up, friendly... service for a easy to use, reliable and user friendly product.What else?"
JR Flournoy,1,1,Came with my Orbi wifi. Installed on Mac Book Pro and laptop would not complete rebooting. Tried everything and finally had to go to Apple who tried everything and failed sooooo they had to wipe the laptop and reinstall operating system. Customer service gave me a 14 step response to install and wanted know who my interest provider was and what the error message was. Guess they did not read my email about locking up. what a joke but then again its Romania. Use at y our own risk.
Mark Ellis,1,5,BitDefender Support is first class. 24/7 and usually resolve issues in a timely manner. I have used their technical support 3 times in 6 years and only had one problem with an Axis Camera software which took some time for BitDefender to work around. All other fix's were quick and down to things that were sub optimal my end.  They are my GoTo for antivirus and internet security.  5PC Protected
Jens Lundgaard,1,5,I got a very quick and good ansvar to my question
K.F.,1,5,"I have been with Bitdefender for over 7 years. They provide reliable and effective products that provide peace of mind! Recently, I had to contact customer service after upgrading a product, and they immediately took care of business. Thank you, Bitdefender. Keep up the outstanding work."
Webmaster for a small sailing,3,5,They were very quick to sort out an issue when I had trouble activating my renewal purchase and I have been happy with the protection for some years.
Юрий Окороков,1,5,"The program reliably protects your computer. Good technical support. Disadvantages: 1. In the latest releases of Bitdefender, when opening programs, it began to constantly remind of itself. This is annoying. 2. Information about the need to restart the computer to install some updates can be obtained only by opening the program. It is not comfortable."
Lynn,1,5,"Coming from an IT field, I have experienced issues with email notifications. Hence, I seek immediate support when the time lapse of 24 hours, no activation code was sent to my spam mailbox or inbox. Support staff was able to resolve issue immediately. I suggest more intensive testing on email notification sent out since my case was an exceptional one, I'm not sure if your end experiences this as well. A good infrastructure setup could ensure that your customer service won't have to deal with a simple case like mine. Customer service staff can be trained to do other issues."
Cameron Amadio,1,5,"Wasn't sure how to activate the subscription I purchased, so I called customer support. I got someone on the phone in less than 60 seconds. And although my issue was a little tricky (my own doing) he was able to resolve it WAY beyond expectations."
PFM,1,5,I have used bitdefender for several years and it has always been reliable and dependable and the few occasions I have contacted support they have been excellent.
Kenneth Allen,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for over 12 months. I have found it to be a brilliant anti-virus product. Also on several occasions it stopped me from loading a malicious website. On the one time that the website was not malicious,  I had to enter a code to proceed.This is excellent.As well, when I needed help, I was able to phone them. Full marks to Bitdefender."
Mr Pascal Morenas Prevost,4,5,"I had a problem setting up my 5th device for my son who lives outside the country. The customer service was very efficient and quick in helping me solve the problem. Plus, this antivirus is very efficient"
Anonymous,2,5,"Very good software and VPN service,I use the VPN all the time, is fast secure and handy.Do not believe others because they apparently cannot afford a VPN."
Rob B.,2,5,The app works very well. Their tech support is very quick to respond and gives easy to follow instructions which I found worked first time.
Ross,41,1,"This Antivirus is Malware. You buy a Antivirus to block pop ups, ads, viruses, etc. Bitdefender? Even if you have ALL notifications turned off in both Bitdefender, and Windows a pop up ad for Bitdefender will force itself into your system as a pop up to sell you more Antivirus. My subscription had over half a year left, and I was receiving these malicious ads every day."
Raymond Woytowich,1,5,I had by error given a wrong email address when I placed my renewal order.  I contacted Bitdefender and it was corrected with no hassle at all.

Kerri Groves,1,5,"We have been using Bitdefender products for many years now and always been happy, not only with their superb technologies, but with the communication methods they use to keep their customers informed of every step of the order process and their tremendous support people.Very efficient and capable company in all regards.  Wouldn't be without them in the world of bandits that exist today."
krunal patel,1,5,"I use Bitdefender Security for all my Smartphones, Laptop & Desktop. Very satisfied with it. I even installed this in to my parents smartphone too. Automatically scans devices. Useful feature of Anti Theft, Location finding."
Paul F.,2,5,Absolutely the best protection you can purchase for all your devices. Great customer service! Over the years I've had ALL the major brands for virus/web protection. Bitdefender is definitely the one I'm staying with.
Rene,9,5,Great produkt and great support.The best!
Michel Philippe,1,1,"This is the third time I am requesting a proper explanation regarding the removal of the widget in the 2021 version & it would be good if the development team seriously answers this question properly this time.In my last 2 emails you people only replied back ""since windows moved to metro interface hence the need for bitdefender widget was not necessary"". This is not at all an explanation. In the worst case this does not at all sound like an explanation.Get a proper explanation from the development team which can explain exactly the removal of the widget.Ask your development team to visit the bitdefender community forum. The removal of widget has resulted in people shifting to some other vendor. And some are waiting to get over their subscription so that afterwards they can shift back to some other vendor. Wake up bitdefender staff, when someone gives you feedback, you reply back saying we value your feedback and will consider it. But then that consideration goes to the garbage bin. This is how the customer section of feedback works in bitdefender.I know since this mail is going to be seen by bitdefender support, so I request you to kindly forward it to development team, and ask the development team regarding the widget, because if it gets refused, I will also have no option to move from bitdefender to some other vendor.If bitdefender development considers introduction of new things they can and are free to introduce it, but when it comes to removal of things from the product at least you should hold a poll on bitdefender community forum to get the feedback from users.Well bitdefender miserably is going to regret the decision for removal of the widget. It's high time bitdefender rethinks about the re introduction of widget until it will lose millions of customers at a speedy rate due to one simple negligence from the bitdefender development team.Many petitions have been created against bitdefender to bring back the widget, and if bitdefender knows social media is a very simple way to make bitdefender lose its customer. So it's up to the development team now, if users are paying you for buying your product, then they should be completely satisfied with the product they are using. And as known an unsatisfied person can cause a huge loss to any company by sharing his reviews to another person, and that another person sharing his view with some other (more like a chain) or through social media like facebook, twitter, instagram.So, now the ball is in bitdefender development teams court, either they agree to make their customer satisfied by reintroduction of widget, or they start losing customers on a high scale.I hope bitdefender staff will get some trusted, knowledgeable and authentic information from development team (not like earlier nonsense replies, since windows moved to metro style, we removed the widget)Awaiting response back from development team.Regards"
Yvonne Simpson,1,5,I had a reload issue and called and was treated polite and we figured it out and he advised they were there 24/7 any issues call back. I love that you have a phone number as well as email!
Alexis Scholl,1,5,I love Bitdefender. I have used them for years.The security is great and so is customer service. They go out of there way to solve any problems and are always very polite and willing to help.
Brian Mercer,1,5,"Great products, protection, and customer care!"
Alex T,1,5,"Excellent after sales service, please keep up the good work. I’m totally pleased!"
Bill Robinson,1,5,Very fast response from customer service & got it right the first time. Kudos!
B Conway,11,5,"There was a mix-up with my renewal of Bitdefender Internet Security because I forgot that I had set up automatic renewal last year at a discount price, and I paid for a separate fresh renewal at a higher price. Bitdefender spotted the error and emailed me and quickly sorted it out when I phoned to say that I wanted to revert to the automatic renewal. They refunded the new payment immediately."
TomK,1,5,One of the nice features of Bitdefender is a warning (and stopping) of threats from sites referenced in emails.  My mail client tried to access one recently during a receive and Bitdefender stepped in.  I was fairly sure the site was alright but of course I didn't want to chance it so I reported it to tech support.Bitdefender support was prompt and helpful.  After supplying the detailed information it was a very short time before the site was analyzed and permission added to their database.Bitdefender provided its typical great support.
Matilda Ezze,2,5,"I had a problem with my VPN when  Microsoft updated the Windows 10 version  2004 So I had ""VPN Error"" However, Bitdefender fixed my problem immediately. A wonderful staff member advised me to simply uninstall my Bitdefender VPN and re-install it again . Thank you Bitdefender I have been with your company many years and trust all  their products. Thanking  you   from  Mrs. Matilda Kitching Queensland Australia"
Brian Mawhinney,1,5,Had a small hiccup with my activation code but it was sorted out within minutes. Excellent job.
Chrissie Robinson,4,4,"The product is excellent and technical back up second to none but Bitdefender should treat loyal customers better. I was about cancel my subsription because of the high price, it was then they made the offer of the same product for half the original asking price. The package I am paying for allows up to 5 devices, I only use it on two PC's so why dont they offer a package to suit me."
Wayne Wilgan,1,5,I can feel safe on my computer while banking and surfing
Graham Lockey,6,5,I bought VPN Premium and 2Checkout's link failed. I emailed BD and the problem was resolved without delay. It's one of the reasons I have a range of BD products and remain a satisfied customer after many years.
James Bigglesworth,7,5,Good detection rate. Low impact on PC. Excellent CSU.  Great prices too.
Jim,1,5,I requested clarity regarding my upcoming billing. It resulted in a quick and comprehensive response.
Titus McGuirk,1,5,In my humble opinion: Bitdefender has protected me from the latest attacks from anywhere on this rock. I just forgot to change/update my email address to keep my p.c. covering me!
Doloresanne Leonard-Morgan,1,5,I was asking for upgrades for new versions of Bitdefender.
D Newman,4,3,"Have had a problem with portscan notifications.  These things happen regularly, to any device exposed directly to the internet.  Most home PCs are behind a router and wont experience this though.  I however am in the DMZ on my device.  A good firewall will block a portscan, as bitdefender does, however it also notifies you and focus steals.  I can be playing a game and boom, games gone because Bitdefender is showing me a useless notification that it has blocked a portscan.  Good job bit defender, now stop acting like the malware I expect you to prevent.No setting for notifications will stop this - not that frontline staff understand this.  I have stopped trying to talk to them, as a more senior member has expalained that this is a design flaw (not the words they used) with the current interface (found guides for how to turn it off on older interfaces).  However, other support staff still responding to my commends have told me to - switch off port scan proteciton!! send screen shots of the error log (did it, but why), send an analysis file of threats for my system.  Apparently none of them know what a portscan is!!Apart from this, the software is very good.  It is a shame that this oversight makes the software close to unusable for someone in a DMZ.  I am also concerned at how very poor the knowledge of basic security front line staff have.  At least 2 support staff I have spoken two dont know what a portscan is, and one of them told me to turn of the feature!!Despite having a long period left on my licence, on several devices - I am looking to pay for the licence on a rival product because of this one oversight.  I'll revisit one day, hopefully they will put a little more thought into their awful UI."
Mr Reviewer,28,5,A great product at a reasonable price. I have spoken to customer service on two occasions. and they have always been helpful and knowledgable.
Talal,1,5,
alen vidulov,1,5,"some 15 days ago i bought your product and bought as well the technical support reinforcement for installation your product on my computer, the matters turn out that i don't have a time to installed it right a way, obviously the code expired or something like that happen which prevent me to activate Bitdefender complete.i gave a call to Customer service and i spoke to your agent Alex, he asked me verification questions to ensure that my privacy  and after this he guided me promptly how to fix me problem. What deeply impress me is that beside the fact that i was guilty for code expiration - Alex provided me with new code and not only this, he mention, that i did installation job and i will be refunded for the money i payed in first place.i ensure him that i don't need any refund - i need Bitdefender to run on my computer, but i am deeply deeply impressed that somebody (the firs time in my life) was worry for my money and would like to protect me and care for justice in advance to me.Dear Bitdefender team, your product is Great great product but i would like to say that your support agents are Creates assets to you company as well.i will be forever with you, THANK YOU"
Barto Niki,1,5,My experience confirms the high value of the product and professional service. Better then the most popular software.
Theresa Newland,1,5,"I recently contacted Bitdefender customer support to change the computers that were listed on my service. They made it easy and quick, with simple to follow directions that had my new computer up and running in a few minutes. Couldn't recommend them more as a computer security suite. Highly recommended!"
diego paiva,1,4,"BD is a very high-rated internet utility, protection wise. it's interface is clean and easy to understand. it's not perfect, no other is, also. BD support team works fast when you contact them and it's super easy to do so."
Blake Walker,1,1,Their customer support is dishonest and will try to scam you out of money. Attempting to cancel or modify your service is extremely difficult and requires multiple steps and a third party to get get it done. Will not be using this company again.
Brian,3,5,Well deserved good reputation. Reliable.  Easy to use. Easy to install on other machines.  Keeps my computer clean and healthy.  Definitely the best virus software I've ever had in 40 years of computing.
Phil Golding,2,5,I had a problem with my subscription that was my fault And it was sorted out within the hour by the support team in a very professional way which is a bit rare these days so thank you Bitdefender.Phil Golding
KK,1,5,Having ongoing problems with Time Machine and backing up - running Catalina 10.15.6. Stuck indefinitely on ‘Preparing back-up’ but running scan with Bitdefender solved the problem instantly even though no viruses found. Don’t know how it worked but it did! Ended several days of frustration looking for solutions to this TM problem.

Peggy Hewitt,1,5,"Have used Bitdefender for years.  Great value, no issues, good customer support and best of all, does what it is suppose to do.  Protect without causing me all kinds of other issues, like my old products did."
laicheeheng,2,5,"Bitdefender popup notification ""Infected web page detected"" appeared as I was surfing the web. The pop up notifications showed up in a few webpages and thats when I contacted Customer Support with details of the issue, for the technical experts to analyse.I am happy with  the speed which Bitdefender  Customer Support emailed me to acknowledge receipt of my report escalation and followed by advise on how to resolve the issue."
Devoted To Christ,2,5,"BitDefender is unlike any other security program I've ever used. It is far superior to most and there is simply no competition in terms of quality of the product, support services, and extras that come with your BitDefender subscription.  Well worth it!

Marshall,1,5,"Hello Team,Good Afternoon to All the Super technicians and problem solvers of BD support desk. Its this lock-down, otherwise, i am imagining myself standing amidst you,ll and shouting with delight on the excellent customer service experience i have had from your team. From expertise to personalizing the query, the help rendered was outstanding!Top of the mind recall would be "" The Human Touch"" received from your professionals amidst my predicament. Being a victim of cyber crime the level of temperament maintained by your team in troubleshooting and giving assurance is quite overwhelming. The best part i liked was "" None of them lost their cool and sounded knowledgeable. And, knowledgeable they are indeed! The Ownership taken by each one from your team to resolve my query, if i may say, surpassed all my understanding i have had, in my 15 years of hardcore customer service experience.I came with a burden weighing beyond my capacity to tolerate but the same was taken off from me with a smile! I thank God!At this very spur of the moment i am left with the below feelings to cherish...,SatisfiedComfortedSecuredAssuredConfidentHappyThe players knew exactly what they were doing, to begin with, and dedicated themselves to make my day!My special thanks to Mr. Khamis Mohammed who went that extra mile in helping me and placed me in the comfort zone at the beginning of the call. Allow me to give you a piece of my mind and feeling - As a victim of hacking, in a way, i could relate myself to a rape victim. I could sense how much more of a mental trauma it must be in case of a physical abuse.It was absolute mental torture for me, every time i touched my laptop!And, that's when Mr Khamis came for my rescue. What I like about this fellow is this - i poured out my plight to him and he acknowledged the same with a human touch! Its very rare enough to see an agent stepping into the customers battle for his/her rescue.Best of Ownership with a superb blend of human instincts would be my rating for him! There was commitment,followup,responsibility seen in his approach.This fellow knew that he is human being first and then an employee!. It is this very truth which impressed me about him.Regardless of all the know how and certificates, i believe, customer service is all about embracing the very fact that even you're a customer end of the day.Then of course we have Mr Kishore J who intervened at a later stage and gave the problem incident its finishing touch. My conversation with him did not last long but was technically crisp in nature. By putting all his knowledge into practice he escorted me to the point of resolution. And, the issue was resolved!!!Finally, Mrs Sana with whom i spoke to this afternoon. Again with an intent to help, she appeared to have taken appropriate ownership and sounded willing enough to assist me with a customer centric attitude. Found her to be pleasantly patient in dealing with customer concerns.There you go! The above comments are true to my knowledge and are being articulated with a sole intention to build them and others towards customer satisfaction. Having said that, they truly deserve a sense of recognition across the skill set for the human in themLastly, allow me to close with the below phrase,""Its not one's aptitude, but attitude which determines your altitude in life""Thankyou for serving meYour's sincerely,Marshall Richard8652010202"
Ed Wiens,1,5,"To date, my laptop, our Samsung tablet, and two Samsung phones have been safe from hackers. I have been with Bitdefender 4 or 5yrs!!"
Beeta Masoumi,1,5,"Exactly what I have been looking for: - Security solutions for any type of OS and device, because we have both Mac and PC- Different types of security apps so I don't have to pay for something that I don't need - reasonable pricing- Very easy to set up and to work with software/app- Superfast in response, super caring, and amazingly knowledgable customer service."
Carl Frank,1,5,I had an issue with renewing my subscription in that i renewed using a different email account and thus lost 50+ days. One help request quickly fixed it.
Marlene Stead,1,5,"I  had been having many notifications of virus attacks and as I am 86 years old and not that computer literate and can't have anyone come to help me due to the corona virus, I asked for help from Bitdefender support and was so thrilled that they were able to fix all my problems with the laptop."
Alan Wayment,1,5,When having difficulty with activating product the customer support team were excellent and after putting my mind at ease then dealt with the difficulty with verbal clarification and follow up email
zMonKunG,1,5,Very good! I'm using the trial right now and I'm definitely going to buy it! (If I have money lol)
Rose Nagle,1,5,I have been a customer of Bitdefender for a number of years now. Their product is excellent and their customer support is just as good. I would highly recommend them if you are look for a product to keep your devices safe.
Rolando ARMAGO,1,5,Support is like sitting next desk with responsible person from Bitdefender team.
Flemming  Hansen,3,5,Very efficient and quick support
Steve F,26,5,Have been with Bitdefender for 3 years now and I have to say their product is BRILLIANT based on my own personal experience. I have needed to contact them on 3 occasions during that time and each time their customer service and support has been EXCELLENT each time.
Mr ian morgan,39,5,"Used for quite a few years. Bitdefender always seems to go that one step further in protection, sometimes it may frustrate and installation, but that is doing its job.Few firewall niggles not providing exceptions. Excellent value for money."
Frankie,2,5,The program updated to the latest version and a few of my favorite add-ons were nowhere to be found. The customer care person helped me so professionally and took the time to make sure I got what I needed to do right. Well done on amazing customer care! Keep up the great work!
Geriatric from Sheffield,5,5,"Had a problem with renewing my subscription.  Was referred to the 24 hour support by Bitdefender. Sorted in 10 minutes by a calm, efficient and pleasant helper.If only all support services were like this then the world would be a better place."
Badarinarayan,1,5,"I am using this product for past 13 months and today I renewed it as I find this a the best product in the market which offers all security measures to protect the devices both windows based, Android and Apple products.  On top of it the friendly prompt and quick resolutions from both Customer care and Technical Engineer team of Bitdefender.  I strongly recommend this product  .   TRBN"
experience helps,4,5,Fast to get running and works exactly as it should.
Victor Sorial,2,5,"No comments. Just all good: customer service, software."

Vijai Krishnan,1,5,"Review is in the product name itself.""BITDEFENDER TOTAL SECURITY"".I trust the security when I do bank transactions, install apps and in browsing."
Armand,5,5,"Total Security is a good solution. And also it is possible to transfer your licenses from old devices to the new ones. I got prompt answer from their support team even in Sunday.The best thing was when they realized that my ""renew annual subscription"" switch was active they inactivated to avoid double charging. This situation occures if you buy an early-bird offer which is better than annual."
Nidhin Mathew Manjooran,1,5,I had queries about purchasing a subscription and the support person made it very easy for me! Extremely helpful and knowledgeable.
Al,4,5,Software is No. 1 and Customer service is 10-star.
David,2,5,"Been using Total Security Bitdefender for several years. Reliable, comprehensive and user friendly product. Professional Customer Care offered good communication with patience and respect. Exceeded my expectations. Only problem was that my phone contact was cut off in the middle of a call. Agent emailed me to apologise. Phoned again and solved my problem. Highly recommended."
Marilyn Fraser,1,5,Bitdefender is a powerful without slowing down you device.  I have never felt safer while on line or opening a e-mail.I love it and it 's the best protection I have ever used.
Jan Cornelius Andersen,18,5,Excellent product and excellent support service if needed
Gary S.,7,2,"Great protection, light on the system, and updates frequently. But trying to uninstall it completely from Mac is very difficult for the novice user. The uninstaller app doesn’t do it completely. Lots of hidden and leftover files, their support team always want to remotely take control of your computer to fix it. No thanks."
Dirk van Barneveld,3,5,"Easy on installation, easy payment options, always works on the background. No specific knowledge needed. Works fine."
Ben G.,14,1,"Your free product has not detected me from ransomware on my computer. You no longer produce a stand alone Linux rescue iso and so I have been left up the creek without a paddle. ""Alan"" on the telephone (answering all telephone options) was wholly useless and told me he would raise a case and get back to me within 48 hours."
Steve,1,5,Bitdefender was easy to install. After installation I had an issue with popups offering additional services. I found this annoying and submitting a request. Bitdefender Customer Care responded and resolved my issue within 24 hours.Bitdefender could improve its tutorials for new customers.
Eugene,1,5,Could not purchase product by advertised discounted price. Contacted customer service and was pleasantly surprised by how fast my query was resolved. Great customer support.
Smith West,1,5,I have been a Bitdefender customer for more than 5 years. I'm using Total security and VPN service both. Never had any problem with a product and its user friendly. Highly recommend.
"Gordon,  Dundee",4,5,"Having upgraded, I was having trouble installing the upgraded subscription software.  Submitted an online query through Bitdefender Central which was picked up within a couple of hours and an email received with the information I needed to resolve the issue.  The support engineer's email tone was also very good."
Paul Ryder,1,3,"Not very impressed with this, it may protect you but their popups and sales tactics are as bad as adware, no sooner have you handed over your cash you are immediately prompted to buy another product to supposedly enhance your experience, then you install their software and suddenly your WPA2 protected and simple home network is ""not safe"", no explanation as to why, so that'll be another product to protect you with a VPN, enable it and you get a piffling 200MB allowance before they want more money from you. It may well protect your PC but this is a horrible product. Pleased that I bought this at an introductory price, very unlikely I'll be renewing next year at full price."
Georgios M,2,1,"Case Opened: 30/06/2020 (93+ days ago)Case Status: PendingORIGINAL REVIEW: Posted on 07/09/2020UPDATED REVIEW: Posted on 01/10/2020 (after BD’s Trustpilot response)Click on my profile link to read the original review, and BD’s response, as to realise the magnitude of inadequacy you may experience. Then come back and read this to understand the extent they will go to, so that they do not provide the time to resolve your issue. In my case it is a “downtime” of 93+ days, no access to my phone.They sent me an email signed by their ""Technical Support Team Leader"" after the review (09/09/2020), requesting my contact details and asked me to reply by giving him 12-hour notice so that he can setup a phone call meeting, in investigating any issue. I replied within 24-hours to their email, providing an additional 3-5 days’ notice to their favour. I waited for days and again no response, hence I sent another email a week later (16/09/2020). The result is further inconvenience as I am once again ignored for another 21+ days, meaning that the case has not been resolved for 93 days, and counting.		If they had read the actual communications and review, they would undoubtedly be aware of the problem, while a simple follow-up would have ensured that the service levels have been met. However, BD, is insinuating to all of us Trustpilot readers that they are prioritising and resolving serious issues in private, through quality assurance controls.I just want to access and use my phone as I could before their app rendered it useless, 93 days ago. Therefore, for the third time, I request that they provide me with their Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) scheme and/or Trading Standards Association in order to further escalate the situation they are apparently unwilling to resolve.NOTE: All communication is recorded and available to Trustpilot review inspectors."
Frank,1,5,I paid on line to renew my Bitdefender subscription but didn't find the activation code.  I emailed Customer Support and they promptly sent the activation code and instructions on how to apply it.
John Raszcewski,1,5,Was provided with quick response to my inquiry. Received an answer and solution to my problem.Bitdefender has top notch customer service.
ambleside62,8,5,"Renewed subscription, however, apparent by some factors on platform nor working e.g. VPN and click-for-support button. Contacted service by different route since button inactive. Very satisfied with customer care which, as expected, was an uninstall / install sequence. On installing it was apparent that the platform dashboard had changed, suggesting a platform upgrade had disabled certain functions. Logic dictates that since most people are not tech savvy, fiddling with the platform, but not informing customers will inevitably lead to a loss of confidence, and hence reputation. Consequently on a platform modification it is surely wisest to inform users and how to update their platform accordingly. Regrettably, this issue of platform tinkering is endemic and I have experienced this with other antivirus software, whereby a platform modification is a) not announced and b) causes interference and disruption. Hence punters move to another AV system, when all that is required is a follow on upgrade to the new platform. I guess such companies don't think of the end user nor reputation and so should set the bar of understanding to the lowest common denominator - the non-tech punter."
Andre West,4,5,"With Bitdefender you don't have to worry about anything with any of your devices. In my experience, no other providers come even close to the level of security that Bitdefender offers!"
Andreas Wolf,2,1,"Crap. Doesn't find obvious virus in the system. And the firewall controls are very cumbersome. I often don't get alerts & programs are just blocked. Unblocking them is almost impossible.Despite all the other ""security"" features are spamming with notifications ALL THE TIME! (""We switched your computer to work profile now!""). This appears even after deactivating the ""feature"".Use another anti-virus solution!I already tried their customer support, as they also billed me 20% more than was offered, but I didn't even get a reply after writing several times...And now I get the answer from Bitdefender that I should address their crappy support, because they say I'm to stupid to configure Bitdefender properly. Trust me, I am a power-user and never have problems configuring programs. It's your crappy software that is the problem..."
Dmitriy Solovyov,2,4,"I got contacted, the issue is resolved and I got additional free subscription.  Updated my review copy of my emailGreetings,There is no quality in your support. Zero.Copy of my email to 2ChekoutI am also preparing letter to PayPal to inform them that 2checkout /Bitdefender violate PayPal policies and hurt PayPal’s customers: deceivingly writing off money off my card, while both PayPal and my bank show money gone and paid, sending me Bitdefender’s email mashed up by 2Chekout, stating “confirmation of payment receipt”, yet not sending me Activation code. If money received, it is NOT MY PROBLEM what you do with it – you MUST send your customer activation code. Lack of integrity of payment processing at your side and being cheap with your provider and customer support is not correct. I waisted my time with customer service rep who could only tell me go away to speak to 2Checkout. It is a material for handbook “how NOT to treat your customer ad how NOT to manage payment processing”So much for BitDefender being “security company”Won’t be surprised you go bankrupt shortly, or perhaps you have had and this is the reason of money being lost /blocked--------------------------------------------------Greetings,I have never come till today across such gross negligence and lack of transparency the way my transaction was handled by 2Checkout and BitDefender-	I received Paypal confirmation for payment-	I received 2Checkout/Bitdefender confirmation of receipt of funds saying activation code is to followNothing happened. Bitdefender support blames poor processing of 2checkout stating they have not received the moneyI want my money back. I do not trust Bitdefender anymore and have no desire to use products of security company having no clue of how to handle money related transactions – even email itself is misleading.I do not want to deal with sites using 2Checkout as I am not happy giving away my money to a middle guy having no capacity or having hidden reason to hold clients money for whatever they could use it (algo trading, % charge on temporary placements)  - I have no idea and no desire to transact with neither Bitdefender nor 2chekout anymorePlease send my money back NOW. Stop sitting on them. In fintech, clearing of such payments takes seconds. Payment service providers that can’t perform so should not be in the businessThanks"
Soren Lyngso,1,5,Very reliable product that does not bother you with unwanted publications and which does not take possession of your PC such as some of the competition.
C ES,1,1,"I contacted customer support by phone after less than 1 day of usage on my free trial. I had uninstalled the software accidentally & when I expressed my situation to the (Indian) rep he said that once the software was uninstalled, their policy of installing the free trial again was impossible & that I had to pay for the full yr. So...obviously I'm not too supportive of their customer support team (since I was testing how amicable, understanding, personable, & worthwhile they were) in resolving situations. After all, if they can't be open to resolving easy issues, then what does that say about how they handle the diffucult ones? He easily could have done a work-a-round on his end to re-establish my 30 day free trial~~he  simply didn't want to."
Peter Clough,2,5,I was thinking of getting a different product but I was convinced that I had been given excellent customer service and technical service when I needed it why change a good thing.
Mr Gale,7,5,I installed Bitdefender several years ago. It has run smoothly and on the only time recently when I had a query about an error message it was answered promptly
Maggie Sharman,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for some time and had no problems. I had a close call with a scam. I downloaded some software called Restoro as I was having a problem with my laptop. I allowed them to remotely take control and they said they had fixed it but there were other issues that needed fixing urgently or it could do permanent damage. To cut a long story short the guy tried desperately to get me to authorise a Tech guy to 'fix' it for £165 and could pay over four months. I eventually clicked this was a scam and kept saying no, and he got down to £79. I stuck to my guns but was worried about the fact they'd had access to me laptop so I rang Bitdefender. The chap I spoke to knew of Restoro and said they are a fraud. He explained what I needed to do and sent an email to back it up. I was so relieved as it really did shake me up."
Axel,5,5,As I live in Switzerland you sent me a german text. As  live in the french speaking part of the country I would have prefered to get in french
Will J,14,5,Great product - easy to access support when you have a problem
Shekhar Kumar,2,5,Amazing antivirus software and totally surprised with it. I was hacked or may be malware that automatically deleted my antivirus. It has happened to me twice. I was not totally aware that it was a virus that performing unistallation. But when i contact bit defender they quickly replied me and solved my problem.
Amanda Sherlock,2,5,I subscribed to Bitdefender a few months ago and so far it seems to be working very well (how do you actually know?).  I received a good and thorough email response from their support when I had a question after being on an unsecured network.  The value for $ paid seems good.
Old Mate,1,5,"Product is amazing and very user friendly. Also, the people working at the company are very understanding and willing to help."
Ivonne,7,5,"After being scammed, Bitdefender did not work when trying to log in to my online banking.  Customer services were absolutely brilliant, efficient in their explanations and provided very clear instructions and steps to follow to solve the problem.  Really excellent!"
Sussex Customer,13,5,"Good product, service and support."
Stephen Cessna,1,5,Good product. Good customer service when required.
Rajatsubhra Chakraborti,1,5,"Best in class.I have contacted many customer services. But none were as fast, and efficient as bit defender.The guy was calm and helpful, and had knowledge on the field that he was representing.Didn't expect that much of a good experience."
PAUL,3,5,"This product is great, blocks just about anything (everything that I have seen in many years of usage. Service is also exceptionnal"
Shahzad Ahmed,4,5,"I made a purchase to continue with Bitdefender on my Android phone and did not recieve a activtion code. I got in touch with their customer service team and they quickly within a few emails got it resolved, on the same day.. infact within a couple of hours....top service."

Chet,2,5,I had an issue with my machine not accepting the renewal of antivirus. I raised a ticket and the customer support were quick to response. The representative on the phone was professional and went far and beyond to resolve the issue I had. It took a time to resolve but eventually we got there and I was very grateful for his assistance and appreciated the effort he made. Well done and keep up the excellent customer support!
Tor Klerk,5,5,"Switched to BD b/c of resource intensive AV, works like a charm, and no pushy marketing, even on the free version - makes me want to support, if it keeps working out"
Aguda Denis,1,5,"I have two laptop installed in Bitdefender security End Point by my Organization called RUFORUM Secretariat Uganda and my second laptop is personal have just installed Bitdefender security Plus last week, indeed the Bitdefender security is only what laptop and desktop owners should for is the real security for every kind of protection that one needs."
Nateshkumar,1,5,Been using Bitdefender for more than four years. The software is very dependable and online support is very very good.
Jim Raymond,2,2,"Very disappointing on the customer service side.  It annoys you to buy their expensive VPN.  Every time I look for clip on on Google it flashes warnings that there are dangerous connections.  Rather difficult to set up.The worst is their Safe Pay feature and customer service.  I tried to install it on my bank URL.  The scroll wheel won't move the page.  You have to manually grab the bar on the right to move the page down.  And I am unable to view my checks anymore.I reported this via chat and the support person had no clue.  He said he's have to send me a 'tool' to provide info to the second level support.  But he forgot to sent it.  I had to write back and when I got the tool it won't work.  I just sits at ""0"".I complained about that and have now been ignored for a couple of days.  It seems to me this is more a beta version and they expect the customer to aid them in trying to fix it.I think I'm going to try and get my money back."
Roy Izatt,12,5,"Ordered a new subscription for my 7 devices in error , when I should have renewed the existing subscription.Would have lost 2 months on existing.Service operator transferred new purchase to existing as add-on after explanation on phone.Great service and great product!"
Matt L,1,5,very happy with prompt replies to my questions. addressed my issue.
John Coughlan,9,5,"Been using their Free Antivirus for two years and it was fantastic ,nothing got through it!Just downloaded their 30 day trial(Total Security) and its impressive and probably the best out there!I would definitely recommend them as I've tried most other company's, just trust me these guys are the Best!"
Jojo,6,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for several years because it proved itself to be unproblematic compared to other security systems. Until recently, I had never had the need to contact them, and I did so with trepidation as over the past six months I have had several bad experiences with companies who can only be contacted by email or by online chat. Within an hour, I received a response to my email--an email that resolved the problem I was experiencing--and after that, another email to confirm that everything was fixed. Great service"
Burak ÇAKIR,1,5,
Terry Sheila Bigelow,1,5,"I am using special communications software for emergency measures and Bitdefender identified a virus (variant.ursu.830923). I researched the problem and discovered it was a false positive. I notified Bitdefender customer care and they gave me clear, precise, secure instructions on how to report  the problem. I followed the instructions and the situation was resolved within 48 hours. Well done! Thank You very much."
Ian Douglas,35,5,I have used Bitdefender Total Security for three years now and it is well maintained and has been improved during this time.  It functions well with a light but secure touch and gives me confidence that I am well protected.  The utilities provided are genuinely useful to me.  I recommend this internet security to others.
Geoff Lello,1,5,"I had 2 issues which I raised with Bitdefender support1) by e-mail about reinstalling Total Security after losing the application on reinstalling Windows 102) by on-screen chat on how to disable Bitdefender VPN.Both were dealt with quickly & efficiently, solving my problems."
F.G.,1,5,I had an issue with upgrading and received a response and solution the same day. I wish more companies were like Bitdefender.
Gerald Barrinton,4,5,
David Curtis,1,5,Easy to use and well priced but I am mainly writing this review to aplaud their amazing customer service that I have used on a few occasions. Very fast to answer internet chat and very helpful and even offered to change the way it flagged a particular program in their next update on a previous occasion that I used support. This time it was an account query that was solved instantly. If only the telcos could be this good.
TheOldgeezah,1,5,I used the website form to submit my query. I received a response by email 40 minutes later. The first attempt at a solution didn't work but the tech support researched my problem and sent a working solution by a second email a couple of hours later.
Susan H,1,5,"Great products, and even better their customer service. Very professional and fast response time. Highly recommend!"
Robijn,1,5,"I feel safe as can be protecting my Mac, Iphone and tablet. If there is a problem the support team acts quick, with step-by-step solutions. There is more malware targeting OSX and IOS products unlike the early days. Bitdefender provides VPN, webprotection and offers good support."
Roberte E. Perreault,1,5,
cousin vinny,9,5,Great internet security protection and a great support team.  Rate a 20 on a scale of 1 to 10.
jack vinski,16,1,"I get no warning of when the device will lock. Im in the middle of a game and it comes out of no where and locks me. I deserve a warning of when it will lock. Also, the staff must've been like 5 years old to create this. Thanks for making me angry."

Jon Greif,1,5,"Bitdefender has been my security software on multiple devices for many years and have been very satisfied, and comfortable with them.  Yesterday, I was unable to download my virus update on one device, submitted a service request, and it was fixed within an hour with a very nice personal response from service rep.  Could not be happier."
Nicholas B.,1,5,I've used Bitdefender for years now and I've never thought about switching to another security software. The team at Bitdefender constantly provides updates for the latest online threats and they add awesome and useful features yearly. Their support team have always been able to help me resolve whatever issue that pops up with the software. They're true experts!
Benjamin,10,5,Really good software easy to use xDJust need to tweek some setting and its all fine ^^ yoy can remote scan pc and update it its really coolBut the vpn not so safe lol Used vpn from bit defender and was tryed logged in from USA on Spotify and Japan by hotmailBut Else Great program
prvn kesava kumar,1,5,
nickB,5,1,"CRAP!Having bought a £1000+ laptop and installed the bitdefender, it was ok but then when I tried to update the software, it wouldn't have it. Their 'tech support' gave the default answer or reinstall!The programs need testing more thoroughtly and users listened to!"
Adam,1,5,"Strong protection. Bitdefender does not slow down my PC. Easy to use and maintain. Five devices with one account. Excellent design of dashboard. I use it for many years and I never was dissatisfy. Just I hate google, please do not ask me to communicate via them."
Suryabrata,3,3,"Great software, but make sure you do not let them autorenew. You will end up paying almost 1.5 times the amount compared to a new customer. So much for being a loyal customer."
Jon G.,1,5,"Great customer support, and the product lives up to the hype. Removed over 800 pieces of malware from my laptop!"
Stu M,10,5,"I've used Bitdefender for a number of years and I've found them very pro-active in dealing with online threats. They make it very simple to setup and administer multiple device households. Whenever I have had to contact their support department, my problems have always been resolved quickly and efficiently. I highly recommend Bitdefender for Total Security."
Rayburn Mertymonz,1,4,I have been using Bitdefender for a number of years software is great. Watch out for their auto renew. I always cancel auto renew on all products I buy. Got an email today saying my auto renew will take a ridiculous amount of money from my account in 7 days. If I had been on holiday etc.!! So make sure you have not auto renewed!
Martin Murphy,8,5,"I wished to extend my cover from 500+ days to 900 + days by taking up the offer of a year of Bitdefender Total Security at a very good price. ( In many years I have never had to contact Bitdefender for help because something was wrong with the programme or Bitdefender failed to protect my Pc, Laptop, 2 X Tablets and 6 X Mobile Phones ) Never Once. Extending my cover was no problem to Bitdefenders staff. Super reliable product with excellent customer support"
RonOne,12,5,Excellent reply immediately solving my issue
David Hughes,1,5,I have been a Bitdefender customer for many years. I recently had an issue when I upgraded a MAC. I contacted the support team and even in these difficult COVID times the advice I received from their support team was spot on and fixed the issue.
rachelle,2,5,Bitdefender is an easy to use anti-virus for anyone. There are a lot of options out there and it was daunting trying to figure out which to choose. I went over the reviews for weeks and finally decided Bitdefender was best for my use. I like using VPN and being able to customize my firewall. And this had it. I have been using it for about 3 months now. I needed help today with using Mouse without Borders and their support team replied quickly. Eduard E. provided me with a link and helpful  headsup tips. I was able to fix my issue quickly with that information. Amazing support team and amazing product. I still highly recommend.
Claudiu,6,1,I've been waiting 20 days to solve my problem and nothing.
Anonymous,2,5,"Recently, I switched antivirus software, after several years with the same protector. Initially, I was a bit annoyed, as a few of my ""Total Security"" options were unavailable to me. I emailed the support team, who helped me to resolve the issue, within hours of contacting them. I'm glad that I switched to a more effective, responsive antivirus software!"
Malcolm Ebdon,1,5,I have never had a problem with the programme doing what out says. Problems I have had were not really the program but other programs and Bitdefender customer support have always been great.
Abhishek Kumar Jha,1,5,"It was a great experience using Bitdefender Internet Security as it is more than enough even for the pro users. Got a minor issue in the beginning but that too got solved within minutes by customer service. I would definitely recommend others to use it and yes don't go on some rumours saying it consumes too much resources, uses 300-350MB of RAM in the background and I hope it should not be a big issue now a days."
Dr. Anil,15,1,"WORST, USLESS, CHEATING, FAKE AND FRAUD either from amazon or bitdefender.I, Dr. Anil had purchased Bitdefender Total Security for 3 devices, 3 years online from amazon.in. It was mentioned in the description that there will be VPN Service (free 200 MB per day). But there is no free VPN 200 MB per day. It's a total lie, either from amazon or Bitdefender. Because Bitdefender are shielding themselves it's a total lie from amazon."
cjwoodward1,2,5,The Customer Service Rep Sebastian N was very helpful and patient with me and answered my many questions and helped me to learn more about the products and to upgrade. I couldn't have done it without his great help.  I feel the product protects computers better than other options out there and the pricing is more than reasonable for the options.
R Connolly,18,5,I have been using Bitdefender for some years and find it an excellent product. On the few occasions I have had to contact them it has always been a positive experience.
Patrick Malone,1,5,
mark heald,6,5,"Since using Bitdefender on our home computers, laptops and phones we have not had any problems at all. Bitdefender does the job of protecting you with the Auto Pilot feature. Customer support is very good and industry reviews are excellent as well. You can delve into BD's features as little or as much as you need. It is perfect for those who want to set it and forget it. We are very happy with Bitdefender and have no intention of leaving."
Nat,1,5,The software is easy to use and reacts fast. It is the most protective antivirus software I've used so far.
Liviu,4,5,I selected Bitdefender after reviewing the performance of several leading anti-malware products.I was also impressed by the Support level received by E-mail in my case.
mathew,1,5,The customer support is very helpful.and bit is easy to use.
K H,5,1,"I used the free version for a specific reason and then uninstalled it.  It did the job but now I keep gettin SPAM emails from Bitdefender and no matter how many times I ""unsubscribe"" they still keep coming...I consider the incessant spam as bad as a virus.Having written my critique I DID receive a response from Bitdfender and I'm fairly confident they have addressed my problem and have corrected it or are in the process.  Mind you...Bitdefender IS a decent product and I would recommend it...I only objected to the spam emails.Well...here it is September 15, 2020 and I received yet ANOTHER SPAM email from Bitdefender even AFTER providing them with my email addy as they requested.  I am REVERSING my ""praise"" of their product and now totally view them as nothing more than a VIRUS or MALWARE installer...the very thing they claim to protect"" you from."
alex,6,2,"Last year i paid for a 1 year anti-virus, which overall was good. however, little did i know they set automatic billing for this service, so after one year i was charged unexpectedly! I had no warning or confirmation of this, the company just sucked the money from my account. then of course i had to dig through there website for support, after finding there email, it took about a day or two just to get a response back, and about a week for them to tell me they have gone ahead and cancelled it.I also paid for a VPN service a few months after paying for the anti-virus. so then i thought if they have set-up automatic billing on the anti-virus then they probably did the same with the VPN service, so i sign in to my account and find out they have done this as well! once again i was digging through the menus of the website trying to find the cancel subscription button, but i had no luck doing so. so i had to use customer support again to get this issue resolved.overall i will not be using this service again, this company make it very easy to take money from you and very hard to cancel or get your money back!"
Mechatronics Greece,1,5,best anti-virus ever ! The company has also great support
R,2,5,"I've been using bitDefender for quite a while now and I'm completely satisfied with the product, I have four bitDefender products protecting all five of my devices."
Larry,3,5,Great product and service. had problems removing a device but ended up my fault
ABBACaS_983,1,5,Kept receiving messages from Apple saying that my software would not be supported on future versions of macOS. Contacted Bitdefender support and was assured (next day) that they are developing for the new macOS; my support and protection will not be interrupted.
Paul P,1,5,My Account settings for subscription renewal were apparently set to auto renew when I purchased the software. I had missed that setting and got caught with paying more than I should have. The product at the time was on offer on my Bitdefender national website much cheaper than the cost of auto renewal (without the opportunity to shop for a better deal). I contacted Bitdefender support and they sorted it in one phone call with a refund that was credited to my account within 3 working days. Then I bought/renewed the product for a 3 year subscription instead of just 1 year due to the much better price and my recently raised level of trust in the integrity and quality of support I had recently received from Bitdefender support. They earned my loyalty and gratitude.
Trevor Simpson,3,5,"Bitdefender is a genuinely great device security product, with no noticeable impact on performance. It secures my devices against threats from the Internet, especially my wife's laptop when she constantly clicks on click-bait links in Facebook which Bitdefender thankfully always blocks.Superb product along with a brilliant support team, which I have very rarely needed during the 5 years I have been using the product."
Jorge Cunha,1,5,Full featured product with galactic protection... simply unmatchable and unbeatable. Best in Class!!!
Wendy C,1,5,The prompt reply and subsequent follow through to my email inquiry were very much appreciated.  Kept up the great work team!
Georgie,3,5,"I've been using Bitdefender on my personal devices now for 3 years, since retiring from work, and I have found it to be much better than the security platforms that my work IT department has ever used..Contacting support is easy and they respond very quickly."
Ahmet,1,5,"My product was not activated automatically after payment and I asked assistance, customer service sent me the activation code by e-mail and the problem was solved. The response could be faster, nevertheless, there was no much delay. Thanks for the good service."
N. Johnson,2,5,"Excellent, elite and professional customer service.  Problem was rectified following instructions provided by the customer service representative.  Problem resolved quickly."
MrMHurst,10,1,Was charged twice and when opened a chat window to dispute the charge the agent never replied.
Ms. J.A. Campbell,1,5,"I have been a client of Bitdefender for many years and rate their protection and customer support most highly.I continue to be confident of having installed the most secure and comprehensive protection at a very reasonable cost.On the few occasions that I have required assistance, their support staff have been very efficient and friendly in responding to my request.I am very pleased to be able to recommend Bitdefender most highly."
Matt Walton,1,1,"Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2019 provided good protection for the year I had it but I changed to a different AV software due to the price of Bitdefender going up. Unfortunately, despite using Bitdefender's own tools to uninstall it, it is one stubborn piece of software and can't be completely removed. Every time I restart my computer it pops up FOUR different windows telling me my license has expired and to enter a new code despite having new AV. This slows my computer down a lot and nothing I've tried will stop it from happening. Very frustrating and no need for this type of thing from a legitimate software company.16 September 2020 - Update. After reading the above review Bitdefender's customer care team got in touch with me and gave instructions on how to remove it. Apparently you have to open their uninstall tool as an administrator rather than just opening it as normal. Nice of them to mention this in the instructions! Although their solution has worked for a few weeks...Bitdefender has come back!  I've just restarted after a Windows update and I'm getting the same pop ups about my subscription. Seriously people? I didn't expect Bitdefender's antivirus software to become the worst bit of malware I've ever come across. Steer well clear! I might have to buy a new computer to get rid of these people."
John Russell,1,5,"Never had any issues with the s/w, regular updates and on the rare occasions I have contacted the support group, response was good and quick"
Colin Parker,10,5,My experience with the survey team was first class
Jaguar937,1,4,Pros: - very good detection rate- decent tech support - isn't that expensive- easy to use- low impact on preformance 2 fps differenceCons:- 500mb ram usage is questionable but I don't mind- sometimes it acts weird but a reboot fixes it-------------------------------------------Overall it's a good antivirus
Jibin Poulose,1,5,"Well, Fortunately or Unfortunately I had to contact BitDefender Support team for an issue. But the issue was handled very professionally and the standards i would say is upto mark, not others lack standard but BitDefender has its own way."
DI,3,5,"Super easy to use, with a lightning fast support team."
Ewans soman,2,5,"In my country Other avs like Kaspersky,Norton are expensive for one device itself. Bitdefender is affordable.I knew about bitdefender from pc security channel.I always wanted to use bitdefender as I was using free avs before I went ahead and I chose bitdefender over other AVS.It didn't disappoint. It will block even slightest of vulnerability in the first place itself.Customer care is great.So far my experience has been amazing.I hope bitdefender keep this standard forever and keep up with competition."
Carole L. Daley,1,5,"I wanted Total Security to include my laptop Microsoft And VPN for the iMac after much labor by customer service he was unable to include both due to the age of my computers.  I was saddened by it, however, Bitdefender did right by me since it was not the fault of either one of us.  The customer service guy was outstanding in his performance.  5 Star."
Robert Holmquist,1,5,"An email to customer support was answered quickly and gave a simple, easy to follow solution.  this was my first time in a year that I had a question.  Everything works so well behind the scenes that I doubt I will need to ask anything again."
Client,6,4,"I deleted my account with bitdefender before the expiry of my license, but still they automatically renewed my subscription! The problem is that they enable auto renew by default (and it is very difficult to find how to cancel it) something, the courts must have to decide upon. Bitdefender, never again!13.08.20 Update: Just received an email from Bitdefender informing me that they will make a refund, something I appreciate and therefor I will change my rating from one star to four stars (they will get five stars when they remove automatic renewal)"
8720,6,5,"A complete solution, easy to handle."
Sean White,8,5,Good service and nice staff but I would say one thing look after your customers with any new software out
Luis Macedo,1,5,Trust Pilot  give me the exoperience to protect me and my pc.
Károly Mészáros,1,5,"The product is very reliable. It's requires only few resources, and it's very fast."
Andrew,31,5,"Overall, I have been using Bitdefender for many years now and it is a very good internet security solution with great support and great antivirus protection and has protected me many times. I highly recommend it."
Theresa Bisgrove,2,1,"Crooks! Took out an automatic renewal whe my renwal wasn't due.  Payments are made by a 3rd party billing platform that want you to set up an account to stop renewal. I was unable to do this in myBitdefender account as the new subcription was already in place and the facility to stop it was removed . You then have to go to Bitdefender direct to get your money back, Paypal refused to stop transaction as thay say it was authorised by me!!!  Now cancelling Bitdefender for good and closing my Paypal account"
Lou Razza,2,5,"Bitdefender promptly alerted me of a breach where my email address was obtained. Subsequently had an issue with continued monitoring, customer service was easy to open a service ticket. Response time was very fast, and their effort to resolve started immediately over next two days. Agents display a real sense of customer appreciation, entire experience second to none."
André Timm,13,1,"I had an issues as i had to ask them about. Already couple of hours later, then i had reply from them. 10/10. I bought the Total security today and i already just love it.Edit :After couple of days, then BD started using All my ram and cpu. And i wrote to their support. They told me to delete hitmanpro.alert bc that was the issues. Now i use Totalav and hitmanpro.alert and No issues at all. So bye bye Bitdefender."
Mr Billy Jones,4,5,I had missed the e-mail telling me that my subscription was expireing in so many days. After trying to recover things myself by sending payment for renewel i also missed the payment confirm payment which only lasts 24 hours. So contacted Bitdefender helpline and the rest is history. Everything sorted and my subscription is running again. Thank?s Bitdefender !!! Bj. Switzerland.
Pat Lynch,1,5,"Thanks for the customer support to help me overcome a glitch in the installation process. My first 2 computers installed Bitdefender with no problem, but the 3rd PC had an issue that required a phone call to customer support. The issue was resolved and the tech stayed on the line until the install was successful."
Pauly Wallyy,1,1,"they have started auto renewal without my permission.i only found out today when i saw a debit for $119 !!!! and another one last month for $59. crooks .you get an email with an invoice that i found after seeing the debit in my bank account , the email gives you the option to request a refund!!!! they take the money then you have to go through a process to maybe get it back ????"
Caeric77,1,5,"Bitdefender has a solid reputation, is easy to use and configure, and as I found out today their customer service can be easily reached and my question was quickly answered."
Maddie Grainger,2,2,Disappointed with Bitdefender support still waiting for issue to be fixed after 12 days. Tried to be patient but now August and not acceptable to keep using Covid19 as an excuse. Security paramount but I no longer feel secure using Bitdefender.
Ross Connell,1,5,"Excellent, prompt support."
Calvin Richmond Jr.,1,5,"Bitdefender is an awesome, effective, and worry free product. Their customer service is also very professional and respectful... ^_^ Bitdefender is an excellent antivirus/firewall and total security system."
Andrew Spencer (NotThatGuy),1,1,"I had cancelled my subscription 2 years ago, due to unsatisfactory performance of the Bitdefender suite I had. Suddenly, they decide to start charging me again this year for renewal. On contacting them, they offered to reduce the cost of the subscription. By a whole $0.01.There is no simple way of cancelling the auto-renewal, and they will not refund fraudulent charges they make once they have your information.DO NOT PURCHASE."
jindan,10,1,"wont even install.  everytime install error or ask u to restart fail 5 to 6 times.  terrible installer.  i have use pc over 20 years i never install a program so badly written.  cant even get the install right, i highly suspect if it can even protect against virus attacks."
Richard,9,5,My cover expiry date suddenly dropped by about a year. I reported this to BD Central and the error was rectified very swiftly.
Sam Jones,3,2,"I just purchased this software. It downloaded without any issues and seems to be working well. However, it enrolled me in automatic renewal without my approval. The Bit Defender website does not allow you to cancel the renewal feature.  Fortunately, PayPal does!"
Customer,10,5,"Very professional,  using both at home and at work. Probably best product market. Outstanding customer service support."
David Astell,21,5,"I needed to contact the team re my DVD player as it seemed to be slow in its operation, but as I thought it was being protected by my Bitdefender.  Thanks to the guys it was sorted in seconds."
Roham Garmeh,1,5,"Great customer support, best anti virus software ever.  Have been using it for 7 years"
The Future,1,1,"Auto-renewal but already renewed?My account is set to auto-renewal, which is fine, upon trying to cancel the auto-renewal of the subscription as stated in their help guidance, coincidently could not connect to this part of the site. Ordered a renewal of the internet security package in advance at the discounted price of £19.99 but was then charged on auto-renewal at £49.99 for the SAME PRODUCT. The reason for the charge was that my account was 'set to auto-renewal', thats great but can't your system see that I have already renewed the product? You are a high level tech company, surely it is not difficult for your system to check this and NOT AUTO RENEW! Unless you don't care and use the extra money to benefit your company's cash flow for a few days/weeks. Really, really poor."
Nick Downey,3,5,"I recently renewed my subscription with a great offer that was sent through to my email address. Upon activation of the renewal, I must have continued an old subscription. Bitdefender picked up on this and cancelled the old subscription, and added the extra days to the new subscription to avoid me having to pay double fees. I got confused with the emails I received so I called customer service and they investigated the matter without making me feel like an idiot, and explained the process. Overall, I am very pleased with my customer experience."
Brian Blair,2,5,"I have used BitDefender Total Security on my PC & phone for a few years, and it has prevented many threats from materializing.  Also, BitDefender does not noticeably slow down my computer.  Furthermore, their excellent service department responds to inquiries quickly.  I highly recommend this product."
Mark,1,5,"There are a lot of different programs that do a fair job, BUT with Bitdefender Ultimate is great for power users. It stops ads, popups, viruses, malware, and more! Like having a VPN with UNLIMITED USAGE! Many do not offer unlimited VPN Usage."
Stephen Glidden,4,5,"I've struggled over the years with computer protection. Many I've tried were ""ok"" but for one reason or another, generally access to support, I kept changing. About 3 months ago I was reviewing tech reports on the best computer protection. I determined that Bitdefender was a clear choice so I signed up. Download was a breeze, set-up was almost a no brainer although I would suggest you take time to walk through all the different areas and do it one time. I've had two minor support issues and both times within 24 hours I had an email response with the correct way to resolve the issue. In my opinion Bitdefender cannot be out performed. Save yourself some time and money and get signed up. Oh yes, they also have a VPN that is available at a ridiculously low price."
US-based customer,2,5,"I had a question about malware protection and got a reply very quickly, which provided me information and showed me that the program was even more robust and  protective that I thought. Very happy with features and pricing."
Michael Clark,1,5,Been using Bitdefender for many years.  One subscription provides security for all family devices.
Paul Wider,2,5,Excellent product that works! And excellent customer service that you can actually reach without waiting for a Lonnngggg time. So many other companies make us wait so long lately. I leave those companies and move to places like BitDefender. 5 stars from me!
Chetan Gandhi,1,4,Strong Anti Virus built in all future with quickly support no chat.. But no facilely free calling in India
farlap moves,2,5,bitdefender is a great security firm to use. i have recommended it to others including family. it doesnt impact my internet browsing and does a great job doing what it says it will do. i am very very happy with it. keep up the great job. cheers
John Enns,1,5,"Excellent support. I recommend Bitdefender to everyone, Thanks, John"
Steve Martin,1,5,"Total Security on three different device's and seems very solid, good customer support. Used three years after being recommended for Apple so not thinking of changing"
Nate S,1,5,Had a long delay on emails for recent subscription order. Still haven't received the code but was able to add the subscription via the link to the Bitdefender Central.
Nani Ruja,1,5,The software is running so far so good. Just got it so can't tell much. The Total Security package with 3 year subscription is a steal with all those features.The customer support team have been very helpful in sorting out the minor hiccup in the product activation.
Mac,10,5,"The software does what it is supposed to do and it is not ""heavy"".The Customer Service is one of the best I have ever dealt with, it is just fantastic."
Kristy Madden,1,5,I had a question about my antivirus and Bitdefender was quick to respond and very helpful.
Malc,4,5,Had a problem which I couldn't resolve so logged a ticket with Bitdefender. Great responses. Technically they understood the issue quickly & provided a perfect resolution.
Mike McLaren,1,1,"Bought and paid for the full antivirus....clicked install...no install started just a pop up for more software, I continued without selecting the extra purchase and hit next and got another add...this one for their install service, refused that hit next..more stuff to buy and still no install in sight. Was getting frustrated at this point I only want one program but bitdefender makes it impossible to do just do a straight up install and just continually bombs you with  chit you don't need. So I paid the install fee out of frustration hoping I would finally click on that magical install button and it would work instead of just pushing me to spend more money....I can't and don't trust people/businesses that deliberately attempt to trick you into spending more than you need."
Sebastian G,2,1,They send you an e-mail with an offer to buy and when you click it so you can buy it...surprize: the prize just got bigger !!! Not serious company !!!
Wayne,3,5,i have been using bitdefender total security for over 5 yrs now and as yet have had no real problems with slowing the system or blocking of pages i want to view etc..therefore it works so much better than my old provider which blocked every other page and clogged up my laptop...say happy to have switched to bitdefender
Dr Robert Morrison,10,5,"This morning, when I booted up my PC, Bitdefender did not appear. So no antivirus. Contacted support and was given some clear instructions that quickly solved the problem. I've been using BitDefender for about 7 years, and I've been very satisfied with it. When I've had to contact support I've never been disappointed with the service."
T Moodaley,2,5,I received prompt feedback regarding my query and it was attended to immediately.I have been using BD for years and rate it as an excellent product to purchase.
D. Welch,2,5,I am very impressed with how prompt and professional Bitdefender was in handling my issue.  Honestly I'm not surprised because Bitdefender is truly the leader in the antivirus and online security industry.  I will only trust my online and mobile security with Bitdefender.
Chris Bosacki,1,5,Great product with a very good customer support team.
Nathan,4,5,Bitedefender has proven to me that the security of my computer system is their concern. When they send an update I know it's needed and should be done ASAP.
Alan Tear,6,5,"Great security, easy to set up and excellent support."
Casey Leo Lai,1,5,
Robert Lazo,2,2,Very intrusive. every time I open a game from steam it freaking blocks it. WT f
Artem Bagdasaryan,1,5,Simple and easy to use. Silent does not bother. Reminds of itself only when necessary. Customer service at the highest level.
Anshuman Das,1,5,Lots of protection in reasonable prices.
Craigo,1,5,"I had questions about a recent extension offer and how it would affect my current subscription. Andrei T. was very helpful answering my question.As a result, I will definitely be extending my subscription as I am very happy with Bitdefender.  I love the interface and the control it affords."
George Liveris,1,5,Very satisfied customer from both product and support.I had a problem and they connected remotely to my desktop to fix it.
Russell,23,1,"Rubbish, intrusive and it'll crash your machine! Installed on a brand new, high spec machine. The initial scan 'identified' a lot (938 instances) of malware. I quaratined these only to find that in fact, I had now lost half my email archive dating back years. I attempted to de-quarantine but this just froze. Then I attempted to remove the software altogether, and guess what...this caused me even more issues. Massive waste of my time. Wouldn't recommend."
Alfonso Cap,1,5,Customer support / service is the Best I've had in a long time. Very helpful and Transparent. Live Customer service agents are always there to help you.I have been using Bitdefender for over 3 years.Just renewed our subscription today.
Catherine Holliday,10,1,I have no way of truly telling if Bitdefender is doing its job.  The issue I have is the constant alerts from Bitdefender telling me to upgrade and so have more security against what I thought `I was already paying for.I have tried emailing them to ask about this but I do not get a reply.  I don't think this is an honourable  way to treat your paying customers.
Lester Tsui,1,5,Bitdefender is a great security solution. I had used it over few years. They also providing a great customer service.
Kunde,20,5,Purchasing by cell phone can course a little problem with the activation code. However just contact customer service and they will sort it out.
Alex,5,1,"I have recently (July 2020) renewed my subscription when I noticed that the subscription was due to be renewed for the cost of £69.99 for 5 devices, so I took a discounted option of £34.99 for the same number of devices. Paid for the software using my Bitdefender user I.D and installed it. Then I discovered one week later that Bitdefender has made a direct debit from the same account with the same user I.D. for the amount of £69.99. I have been in contact with them 5 days ago, but still have not heard anything about a repayment for the 2nd amount. Also the option to turn off the Auto-Renewal function on my Bitdefender user interface does not work. I have used Bitdefender for years, but I will definitely not be using them again after the current subscription period ends in 2021. That is very poor customer satisfaction, which should speak volumes about how good Bitdefender's Customer Support service is."
David Shelton,2,5,"I have a rather extensive network in my home for video survailence and software testing as well as the normal TV's, tablets, phones, etc. The Box provides a tunable firewall as well as individual device software. Before i was always removing viruses from machines, especially my wife's computer, Facebook was a big source of viruses and malware. Since installation my problems have disappeared and stayed away. Being able to easily remove firewall features makes troubleshooting internet software much easier."
Daniel Olofsson,2,5,Great security product and very good support!
Peter Gramling,3,5,I was as happy as surprised about the program and the support.I am experienced (retired teacher electricity and electronics) but not enough experienced to resolve the problem alone.
Gordon Logan,1,5,I had a problem extending my licence which they solved in 5 minutes via an online chat.
J CLAUDE DOUCET,2,5,"contacted Bitdefender support ,very polite and they know there software it took 10 minutes and i was up and running.Best securety for computers never had an issue with my computers since i utilize Bitdefender."
Nayan,1,5,
Dave C,1,5,"I had some problems with the Bitdefender Central app (used to control my home network with Bitdefender Box).  I contacted Bitdefender through their online chat option (twice) and got through to their reps within a minute or two both times.  They were professional, friendly, and helpful.  This seems to be a rare thing these days.  I recommend Bitdefender in general, and the Bitdefender Box as well!My problem was with the app.  It was not recognizing my subscription.  The first time I contacted support, they gave me one thing to try, so I disconnected and tried it (it took about 30 seconds).  It didn't work.  The next day, I contacted them again and they gave me a second solution, which worked immediately.  They waited online while I gave it a shot.  I am completely happy with the company."
Mr vineeth vijayan,9,5,Absolutely Fantastic....Will highly recommend..Biggest relief it does not slow your PC.Keep it up!!!
David,4,1,I've been with Bitdefender for 4 years.. 1st time ever having to call customer service. My phone was stolen and I needed it wiped but I couldn't sign in to the hub without phone verification.  My voice was hoarse from vomiting having a sick stomach .. The guy was confirming my address and spelled it back wrong.. So when I said no not a T..a P.. The guy said I was yelling and he would disconnect the call.. I said Sir.. My voice is hoarse I can't yell.. And he threatened to disconnect the phone call again..and later got SMART mouth about the letter saying he doesn't know how to spell the word that's very easy..Decipher lol.. After my membership ends.. I will be moving on.. I didn't know Bitdefender was ran by RUDE foreigners.. American wouldn't dare to hang up and talk to you rudely ..No empathy of my phone being stolen .. Nothing.. Just rude
Ian,3,5,"I have recommended Bitdefender to my friends and family. Its ease of use, accessibility, security and customer support being some of the main reasons for my recommendation."
Robert Black,3,5,"I purchased this security package for it's ability to NOT tax my system's resources, much like other big name security packages do.  It installs easily, and is easy to maintain. It doesn't annoy me with hourly (or even daily) messages that I really don't care to see.  It handles issues on my PCs, and quietly tells me in the background what it has done. It's not terribly expensive, but do push back on Bitdefender if you think the pricing is not adequate.  They worked with me to give me an upgrade price that I feel was reasonable.  Obviously the longer you can subscribe (in years) the lower you can get the price.  I do my systems for more than one year at a time if I can!  It will require internet access at all times, and an online account for management."
Jack Sørensen,5,5,
Speedy75,4,5,"I've used Bitdefender for 3 years and it's not only the product that's great, the after sales support is outstanding."
popi pribojac,10,5,I have used bitdefender for several years now. Never had any issues and very easy to install and update everyear. Watch out for autorenew though as it charges the full price and you can get it cheaper if you don't autorenew.
Steve Waltman,2,5,"I had an issue with getting BitDefender's password manager to work on a new laptop. I sent a note to support, who got back to me quickly and helped me resolve the issue. it turned out it was just due to some settings I had forgotten about."
G Ireland,1,5,I had a problem installing my renewal to my new Bitdefender subscription. I contacted support and was connected with Gregoire Popsecu.( spelling). Excellent agent but I was sorry I didn't have the opportunity to thank him!Very patient and helpful with easy to follow instructions and a miracle !! I managed to install !!
Elise Lewis,1,5,"Solid product, good price point, excellent customer service."
David Ney,2,4,"They seem to fill most of the boxes, although their email returns for 'help' category seems to take a long time, they are available by phone as well, so...!  Beyond that, it is early days and I am still learning about the more adjustable parts of the software.  I'll be happy to add a star when we are both clear on the subject!"
Nicolai Skødt Holmgaard,10,2,"I have used BitDefender for around 2 years nowI recently started getting an issue where I got an Error 401 when accessing my Google applications (Calendar, Docs, Drive and others)After around a month I find out it's all due to Anti-Tracker.How about a warning when you find out about this?!?"
pkeyrich,4,5,"Technical support was able to resolve my issue on the first attempt, although the software took a while to synchronize/update."
thomas dhollander,1,5,Andrei C. was very helpful and my problem was solved in a minute.
Mort,2,5,
Joan Esty Haefeli,1,5,"I get glitches occasionally but Bitdefender always has sent me instructions on how to fix. So far batting 100%. I save instructional emails and use when same problem reappears, which it does but a quick fix.  My computer has been the culprit at times, so I am happy to have the fixes. Have had no glitches when it comes to the anti-virus, my main concern. It is Traffic Light and Web Protection that need reenabling and one fix does both at same time."
Dave McDonald,1,5,
sofia,1,5,"After uninstalling firefox and re-installing, the wallet and tracker extensions were lost. So I turned to bitdefender for help. The service was very good and a remote correction was started.A little difficult for me as I had to open folders on the computer aimed at connoisseurs.Meanwhile, I found the solution quite simple by reading a bitdefender user guide. The firefox had to be upgraded. When I downloaded the latest version, the two extensions automatically appeared."
D Beck,1,1,"Bitdefender is difficult if not impossible to uninstall.  Once it is on your computer, it is on there FOREVER.  Bitdefender does have an uninstall program, but it does not work on older versions.  Bitdefender will reinstall itself when you restart your computer.  Bitdefender tech support is no help.   Avoid this damn software.  It is worse than the virus you are trying to prevent."
Peter Øberg Jensen,31,5,Many years ago I had Kaspersky but they once charged my account twice. They were aware of the mistake but couldn’t do anything. Then I changed to Bitdefender and haven’t regret a moment. Good software and very good support.
Tonyml88,1,5,Quick response to my call and a knowledgeable service tech.  Very satisfied with the customer service.  Didn’t blame COVID on any delays to a rep.
Jacey Denton,1,5,
Kim Horn Winther,1,5,"My ""Two cents"" :-) about Bitdefender Total Security 2019 + 2020. Good protection and excellent customer support. Easy to use and set up. Frequent updates. Not the cheapest, but quality costs. And is protecting your devise (costing several $100+), really where you wanna skimp on Security ;-) ? I do prefer the VPN I already use, all though Bitdefender offers one (costs extra)."
BM,3,5,I've had a couple of occasions where I've needed to ask questions and Bitdefender are not only easy to contact but their responses are fast and efficient.  I highly recommend this product.
C D,1,5,The Customer Care team is there always for you with all the knowledge necessary and in a professional manner.
Charles Steeve MONGO-SOO,1,5,Very efficient with a fair price to boot. The customer service is quite active as well.
Mark,7,5,"I have used Bitdefender for a number of years, and compared to the other product I used before that, it is good value, had strong features, does not impact on performance, and the support, when needed, is excellent"
Anup Sebastian,3,5,"Great product and excellent customer service.When I had some issue with the product, I contacted online and responded quickly and solved it. I have been with Bit defender for 3-4 years now. Last but not the least, it is one of the best product out in the market."
V Woods,3,5,I've used Bitdefender Total Security for years and it beats other malware software available and the support is second to none and available 24/7.
Andrew D,2,5,"Live chat answered very quickly by a support person who diagnosed the problem and offered a solution, that worked, under 5 minutes"
Tadeusz Jasiewicz,1,5,I am very pleased with your product and intend to use it for many years
mike craig,3,5,I've used Bitdefender security products for years and would highly recommend them.  If I have a problem or query I use the online chat facility.  I've always got thru almost immediately to a rep who has always managed my query or problem quickly and efficiently.
Ali Khalid,2,1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANYI bought Bitdefender Total Security and have been happily using it and recomending it to others for quite a while.I recently upgraded my computer as my old one was more that 10 years old.I downloaded Bitdefender from the website using my account however when i installed it the software was not Total Security but a cheaper less secure Antivirus Plus.I sent screenshots proving my subscription to Total security but was told they were fake and were visual glitches and that i never had Total security to begin with.So here I am just trying to use the software I have been using for years and being told i am a liar and a fake.All because i changed my computer.I would advise everyone to stay clear of this fraudulent company.Nothing but thieves.
Daniele Silvaggi,1,5,I had an issue with my internet getting disabled every 30 minutes so I contacted Bitdefender to see if they were the problem and they responded very quickly to help me resolve my issue. It turns out that Bitdefender was not the problem but in fact it was a torrent client that was at fault. Bitdefender helped to pinpoint the problem and I thank them for all the help they gave me.
timur timur,1,5,Bitdefender Customer service and features are Pretty Good I recommend that
abhijeet shinde,1,5,
Bunyip,1,5,"Reliable product, easy to use, and worth considering as an option for security and peace of mind"
Jeffrey Harger,1,5,Fast response. Great services!
George,1,5,Had a question about my subscription and the representative helped cleared the questions I had. Thanks again BitDefender.
Bob M.,5,4,"A great product that is easy to use, non-intrusive and works very well.  Their marketing practices are however not user friendly.  Be prepared for ""special offers"" with apparently great discounts that are actually more expensive than the normal ""sale"" price available on their website.  If you allow an automatic renewal be prepared to pay top price - no discount for loyalty. Finally watch out for the messages that advise ""your subscription expires in x days click here to renew now"".  My experience has been that the quoted expiry date is usually months in advance of the actual expiry date and if you ""Renew Now!"" you will be paying too much."
Patricia  Georgini,6,5,"I've tried other programs that are pretty good in their own right but I've always come back to Bitdefender. Bitdefender is easy to work with; I feel secure in knowing that they've got my back especially where Ransomeware is concerned; web protection, Safepay. I feel secure in knowing that all my devices are protected while Bitdefender runs quietly in the background; doesn't take up a lot of resources at all."
Dick Walsh,1,5,"Customer service is second to none. They are always easy to work with, pleasant, and get to the heart of the matter with very little delay or fanfare. I am always satisfied dealing with Bitdefender's Customer Service."
Karen Hamer,1,5,"Great efficient support.  I have just signed up with Bitdefender, great software I feel comfortable I'm protected.  When I had a question, they came back to me in a timely manner.  Really happy with the level of support.  Would thoroughly recommend."
Derrick,1,5,"As a software developer and architect, I've always been in search of an antivirus system that does it's job and leaves me alone.  I don't need 1000 notices about my system being ""OK"" - and I don't want the anti-virus software to slow down my daily operations, or max out my CPU trying to process a bunch of files I'm moving from folder to folder (Norton - ugh).I was also happy with the price tag - and super happy with support when I needed them to respond to a request I had about a specific problem.  I enjoy the user interface online, enjoy the fact I can install the software on several computers that I own.  Things just seem to work the way they're supposed to it minimizes my time requirements to manage my security needs.Thanks to Bitdefender for providing a great product that does and acts as it's supposed to, without costing a fortune!"
Richard Williams,1,5,A very good anti-virus program that's better than ones I've tried before.  I recommend Bitdefender.
Jim Cowie,3,5,Purchased order twice in error through faulty mouse. Customer services helpful and quick to respond. Would recommend Bitdefender.
Fermin Sanchez,1,5,Very good integration into Mac OS. The support case I had was promptly and very professionally handled. Very good value for the money.

Delia B.,3,5,"Straightforward service , great protection"
Tuấn Bùi,1,5,"I have used BitDefender Total Internet Security for the last 4 years and never had a problem.  BD kept me protected with minimal effort required on my part.  And when I bought a new laptop and had to contact support to get assistance, the response was quick and professional."
Rene Beaupoil,1,5,
Rocco Tangorra,2,5,Excellent troubleshooting support. Two thumbs up!
Terence Pinto,3,5,"Very good customer service response times and responses, excellent industry product performance ratings, I have been a customer for many years now with no issues other than their using their own cert. for enabling secure web site scanning..."
AP,2,5,This is a great service to have. Dealing with customer service is a breeze and they are extremely knowledge and efficient.

Mike Wright,1,5,
Hector,6,5,"If you want your computer protected against viruses, then use Bitdefender. They're great. I've never had any trouble with them, and whenever I've needed to speak to someone in Customer Service, they've always been polite, helpful and pro-active."
Dennis Allatt,2,4,"I have been using Bitdefender  for about 3 years now with no problems.The customer service/help section are quite prompt with their replies.Buy it off the internet though, as it is expensive if you go direct"
Gordon Yates,1,5,Bitdefender is very good at keeping virus out of my computer. It has been very responsive in helping me get rid viruses and adware that I inadvertently allowed on my system. Directions are well researched and easy to follow.
Terry Goldman,2,5,"Great product, great service, already recommending when I get asked about protection for my Mac!!"
Ross Jones,2,1,Charged twice for subscription.  No refund so far despite requests by email and phone.  Renewal 'offers' for existing customers twice the price of those you can find online for 'new' customers.
James S Dielschneider,2,5,"We explored all the security programs.  Based on our extensive research and our actual experience with several different security programs, it was clear Bitdefender is by far the best."
Michael Soper,1,5,Bitdefender AntiVirus has protected all my Apple / Mac devices for many years.  Several times I've needed technical support and they've always responded quickly and resolved all my issues.
Hasmukh Joshi,1,5,"Total security is the best so far and I am using since last 6 years and all my devices are taken care properly,  most important thing it does not slow down my computers. Easy to use"
Roman Jarosz,1,5,"I use the Internet every day and the antivirus program protects me from dangerous websites very effectively, effectively blocking every attack attempt."
DS,1,1,"One of the worst customer experiences with a company I've ever had. Trying to get the program set up was a multi-day/many hours on the phone with their tech person experience. Frustrating doesn't begin to describe it. I have a Dell laptop. Nothing fancy or difficult. Why this system couldn't just be downloaded and auto-installed like every other program I've ever purchased is beyond me. I had heard about the auto-renewal scam and spend many more hours a month before it was to set to renew trying to ensure that it was actually canceled. You have to go down a rabbit hole to try and find out how to cancel your subscription. Then I began getting bombarded with daily mails telling my subscription was going to end in 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week, 5 days, 3 days,1 day....then I started getting emails telling me how long it had been since my subscription was canceled. WTH?? And when you click on the ""unsubscribe"" link at the bottom of the message, it takes you to their check out page. Nothing there which allows you to manage your emails received. When you search their site for how to stop receiving their emails, they say you can't. The only way to do that is to uninstall the product. Seriuosly, WTH!! I finally just set up my email filters to delete any messages they send me. BitDefender wants to get in your wallet and get in your inbox and never go away. Like the worst houseguest you've ever had. Do yourself a favor, if you are considering getting Bitdefender, don't. Run as fast as you can to any other product."
Mrs C is cross,2,5,"Update: Customer services came back to me within a couple of days and have turned off the auto-renew for me. I have changed my score from 1 star to 5 (I would subtract a point for the auto-renew thing but that seems a bit harsh) as the software seems to work very well with lots of features, has a good interface and is not too intrusive.Original review:I did not want auto-renewal, I did not agree to auto-renewal, there was no suggestion when I originally purchased the software that auto-renewal was activated by default. But I have been charged £69.99. Neither the bitdefender interface nor the web portal 'Bitdefender Central' have a facility to turn off auto renew or to change credit card details despite the help pages claiming there is. So I am stuck with no response from the message sent to the support centre and I feel I am being held hostage. The efficacy of the antivirus software is completely overshadowed by this daylight robbery."
Kshitij Kumar,1,5,
Yiğit Akargün,2,1,BitDefender automatically renew subscription without explicitly asking you. They have sent an email after charging for the renewal not before asking for it. I canceled it right away after I've received renewal email (before my current subscription ends) and sent an email about it but I didn't get any response for 4 days and eventually my account is billed.
prav cker,2,5,"This security company value its customers, at least in my case, they came for help, and they care for many like me."
pranav arneja,1,5,Bitdefender understands how to value its customers by providing quality in efforts time and money. Its products are par excellence
Garry Bower,4,5,"I've used Bitdefender for a couple of years after migrating from a competitor for the Apple range of products (I use on Mac OS, iPad OS and iOS).  The product has always met my expectations and I haven't had my system compromised since using it.  However, what is really great bout the Bitdefender product is the customer services team behind it.  Every time I want to add products, upgrade mid-subscription, increase or decrease device coverage, they can always accommodate.  They have always answered my email requests with a combination of changes which gives me the best value, or takes advantage of an offer at the time, and always added on my existing subscription as an extension to the new product suite I buy."
David Squires,1,5,I have a lot of faith in Bitdefender's capacity to do the job of monitoring the security health of my online devices.
Alan Tuck,36,5,"My experience overall is one of great relief; being able to surf the web, mix among frineds and all other things without worrying about anyone breaking in to my work.  It is seamless, or as seamless as you want it to be, and any problems are quickly sorted by the technical team.  It's great!!!"
Rainer Dorna,1,5,"Why I’m Staying with BitdefenderFrom thinking, “What have I gotten into” to “Thanks for being the people you are,” is quite a leap.  Bitdefender cleaned up an iMac I thought was clean and has protected my mobile devices (iOS). They’ve dealt with my changes of account IDs, etc. So check them out, at least!"
Sasha Ercegovac,1,5,
David,1,5,"Best all-round suite, does the business (compared to other suites in tandem), keeps out of the way (no useless messages)My goto product when I have a problem or helping friends."
Marc.A.L.,1,5,Customer service is top notch. Defense is top rated and fair priced.
Manos Christofakis,1,5,lightweight app that greatly upgrades your security. Plenty of security tools! Great support through customer service! Definitely recommended!

I Donotaccept,1,1,"So you're looking for EASY and understandable look elsewhere! RUN AWAY!Is BD protecting me? Dunno!1) If you don't wish to be randomly told you NEED VPN and up-sold by the BD software - for $$! - then this isn't for you!Other sales and ""suggestions"" continue as well!If you like being harassed into paying more, only Avast! does a better job.After 20+ years. BD is VERY DISAPPOINTING!2) The interface has two components! Your desktop interface and web interface! Both are frightening (which one is they stealing from me?)Since you must watch several tutorials in each of these areas, you end up wasting time!If you're an evil ""enterprise"" (all are) you can easily UN-protect a user and cause misery/harm. After all, $ is all that's important.A really good CEO (Criminal Enterprise Overseer) will email malformed links and inject other malware just to make you cry as they laugh. The danger of the web interface!3) IF you manage to get BD in ""work"" or ""game"" mode, you will pay the price for your convince. Sure the pop-ups (most of which MUST be replied to) become less frequent, but now you've traded silence for security and program PLUS system crashes!- After 1 or 2 hours this ""mode"" will remind you of your choice.Sometimes as your working, or mostly as you change between different tasks, a little box pops up to say, ""Work Profile  We always have your back (NO!) while working. The performance of your device was automatically optimized.""a) No one will ever tell me what that REALLY means.b) If you don't want BD to ""auto optimize"" (as any sane person should NOT) you'll likely have forgotten that you turned this on and will never find where to turn it off! (without contacting through emai or chat)c) ""Profiles"" and ""Auto optimize"" will then start to pop up what that smaller box (quoted above)WHEN this happens, AND it will, several things begin to go VERY wrong,- IF you've opened a program on one screen then scrolled down to the information you need, then keep said info in a second window - Then the pop-up shows!That will reset ALL scroll bars to the top! Oh, a treat!Wasting more time getting things ""lined up"" again.But wait!The pop-up ""Profile"" will continue to cost time!- As the pop-ups become more random & frequent your programs will begin to misbehave and finally start crashing with each successive pop-up.Yes! They will! At first it's just little things that you aren't sure aren't right but you know something is wrong.Then it's worse.ex: An explorer window is open with a directory filled with various types of files.Suddenly you'll only see .TXT files and you wonder what you did to delete the files! Nothing, but BD has BETTER plans for you! ALL Hail BD! Nazi BS! F*king evil corp. overloads! Like Micro$hit, they LIE!(I haven't seen this type of nonsense since Windows ME)-- After all of this mayhem UNTIL your system crashes -- & it will, if you don't reboot in time,You MUST reboot SEVERAL times a day due to BD's imposed instabilities. -- NOTE: Reboot will take MUCH longer because you felt self-confident & didn't reboot sooner. At first you think your system frozen up during ""shutting down""Then the real shock as restarting takes longer.4) Good luck with a support ticket.You'll get replies from several different agents.NEVER the same one again. This takes the issue further away from your problems.  Should you be stupid enough to ask more than 1 question this will throw agents ""off script: and new headaches start.So, callThe situation is either dire or just fed up, so you dig through ""BitDefender Central"" website and finally find a number.You wait & strain to understand thru the heavy accent! Make more than 2 comments and you are INSULTED, ""Eye dunt unesrtand!""Chat is best if you want to waste more time typing & waiting.Long times to reply.Look elsewhere. This SUCKS! Not enough room to to tell all the wrongs!CEO is happy! NO!Pass this s**t up!Only Avast! could earn 0 starAll the same East euro & corpo lies"
Rodney Nix,1,5,The product is excellent with minimum to no slow down of your system and customer service is excellent also.
Poltiser,2,4,Very good antivirus which blocks access of new files to my computer until I let themGood customer careSome options are not strait forward obvious to understand...otherwise I would set rating to 5 starsThank you ;-)
Bruce Wright,1,5,"Big Co.  .... personable & knowledgeable agents..... seem active & on the ball, & up to the minute!  ""Always On""!"
Yohann,4,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for a couple of years now on many computers + smartphone. Main positive point is the low impact of antivirus on the system. It does not slow too much my computer. Second is quite easy configuration of Firewall compare to some competitors : just a slide button to accept / refuse. Some would say it's less convenient than expert mode but I do preferMinor improvements could be done on - smartphone app (more options necessary)- ""BitDefender central"" interface command"
Demetri Andros,1,5,Excellent customer service and technical expertise for assisting customers! Bitdefender Total security provides great security for devices and peace of mind!
Marion F,3,5,"I've had Bitdefender for years, and during that time the customer service has become better and better. They helped me with a problem last year, and another problem a few days ago, I was talked through how to change my Bitdefender settings, and then change them back. I'm not very technically minded, the person was very patient, which helped successfully resolve the problem. Now my computer is working great again."
Kamaljeet Singh,1,5,"i have been using bitdefender for last 2 years, which it self shows my love for it."
John Firbank,2,5,"Best internet security service I have ever used; excellent value for money and the peace of mind well worth it; and finally, superb, 24 hour customer service."
David Townsend,1,5,"People say Macs don't need antivirus and that may be true, but the internet is full of maliciousness.I read lots of reviews of antivirus and internet protection for Macs, and BitDefender kept leading the pack.In about 4 years of use, I've only had one serious problem and that was because I didn't do a clean install on my new MacBook.BitDefender Customer Support solved the problem and all is well."

Jim Roberts,1,5,"Hey, this is a quality product.  It has a very well designed UI.  The product quality seems to be very high; the scans and tools are thorough and helpful. I appreciate the blocking capabilities on suspicious websites.  Plenty of flexibility. I've always followed the reviews for security and Bitdefender has outperformed all of the previous products."
Gregory Hickey,1,1,"I am an old person who has difficulty understanding how to maneuver very well on a computer.  I purchased a package from BD for several phones and a laptop. I was unable to figure out how to load BD on my androids, etc. I was finally able to get BD on one phone. Customer service was of little to no help. I think it was April 2020 when I received a notice I could receive a discount if I renew. I did not review as BD customer service failed to help me understand how to get BD on all my devices.  Then in May 2020 I received a notice of a charge of $49.99 for renewal of BD.  I was then told I had an automatic renewal.  If I had an automatic renewal, then why did BD ask me to renew back in March or April.  This is a deceptive tactic by BD.  After seeing the charge yesterday, from about 8 days ago, I called BD.  I was told my refund request would have to be forwarded to a higher authority, and asked me if that was okay. I said no.  Finally customer service agreed to refund the $49.99. I want to know what is the issue with customer service last year when I asked for assistance loading BD on all my devices. As an old person who does not understand how computers work, customer service failed to assist me in loading BD on all my devices, though I was charger for more than one 'download."""
Fantam100,1,5,"I found Bitdefender to be very user friendly with a quick and straightforward installation and set up.I like the numerous security features which include antivirus, firewall, spam, ransomeware and privacy protection. I also liked the inclusion of some VPN protection in my Total Security 2020 package.Overall I am very pleased to have found an excellent internet security provider for a very reasonable cost."
Aubrey (in UK),3,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for a week now. It immediately found 5 bits of malware that my previous anti-virus software had failed to find & automatically deleted one of them (presumably because it was particularly serious) & quarantined the rest. Also, the front-end of the software is well-designed & easy to navigate."
Daniel T Keena,1,1,"The software worked well initially, but my windows 7 crashed and IT consultant thought Bitdefender was the problem. I re-installed the operating system and never used Bitdefender again. I went to the website and thought I had cancelled my subscription, but a month later I was charged again through auto-renew.I contacted Bitdefender over a week ago to explain I was no longer using the product and requested a refund. Bitdefender service responded to me offering a discount to continue the subscription but they have not refunded my money, for a product I haven't used in 9 months and never intend to use again. I am now forced to file a dispute with VISA regarding the charges, and will be filing a complain with the BBB as well.BEWARE!!! I would highly recommend NOT buying anything from this company!!!If at some point you no longer want / need the software they will continue to fraudulently bill you.Company response noted:I did share all of my purchase information with Bitdefender and their “billing” contractor 2checkout. 2 checkout says the problem is with Bitdefender and they will give me a refund as soon as they receive authorization. Bitdefender says the problem is with 2checkout— classic runaround = FRAUD"

Brent Robarts,1,5,"I have tried a number of Antivirus and Security solutions, and Bitdefender has taken the prize for stability, ease of use and efficiency.  The after sales support is instant, friendly and extremely professional, giving you the feeling that you are truly a valued client.  Pricing is reasonable, and worth every cent.  I cannot see any negative impact on my computer's performance, and updates are done seamlessly in the background.  I have finally found a solution that I will not have to continue shopping around for."
Cacky B.,1,5,"Bitdefender has given me no problems in years that I have used it. The one time I consulted with the support team, I received a timely response complete with appropriate instructions. Turned out I was at fault for not providing enough info for them to evaluate more quickly."
C,1,5,"Your representatives are patient helping a senior who is not very adept with electronics. Also, I appreciate that I feel more comfortable being online especially since there are so many untrustworthy individuals, unfortunately, online. Thank you."
Amit Pandey,1,5,Please try to make make the bitdefender interface a bit colourfull. Overall bitdefender antivirus awfull.The major advantage of it's interface is automatic updation of virus database
Sam,5,5,"My computer were been hacked couple times in last few months with other antivirus installed. Game account, Facebook, Google...etc. after I've purchased and installed Bitdefender Total Security, everything went back to normal. Now I don't have to worry about being hacked.For my opinion, Bitdefender can pick up 90% of the threats compared to other antivirus software. Even with the one with very low threats. That's why I switched to Bitdefender Total Security."
ROBERT BECKER,2,1,"Beware of bitdefender and their unethical business practices/fraud.  They sent me a $19.99 renewal offer which I paid, and once they had my financial information they charged me over $93 for a renewal!  I have sent them multiple messages via email and their site and they won’t respond.  I need to file a fraud charge with my bank.  Do not give them your financial information!"
Ken Preiss,1,5,Bitdefender understands how people use the internet and they provide the most effective and complete internet security for their customers.  Their customer service is by far the best available.
Harmie Johnson,2,5,"After fussing with them about the need to remove Tracking Cookies, and won, I only had one issue with them. They were confused over one remaining year one my subscription-they fixed that. There is no problem with getting your computer infected with Bitdefender on the job! A GREAT PROGRAM!"
LAURENCE,4,1,"Bit defender is a virus that will not go away.Below is my chat with customer service and the robotic response I was given.It is a condensation of the issues.Today, I am trying to uninstall. I have 'uninstalled' it in Revo,but the files are still in Program files and data, and I am unable to permanently delete them.They keep coming back. My only solution to that is below. It took me 10 hours(slow internet) to download all of the IE11 junk that they require. I have never used Internet explorer and never plan to, but couldn't get it to  the install without it.     As Duncan G. said: In all fairness the Bitdefender product is good at what it does. But if you're going to go with Bitdefender you best pray you don't ever need even the most basic of support from their team, lest you become trapped in the circular hell of template responses, legal mis-directions and uncooperative support that I have. I'll never use Bitdefender again.   I agree with Peter Dervik who says:Then I came on here to look at the other reviews, see if people had similar issues, and saw a stream of what I would consider clearly fake 5* reviews. It all seems very sketchy now, and I wouldn't trust them .    They will probably respond by:Don`t hesitate to reach us at ,which only gets me to a search page. :Thank you for contacting Bitdefender Customer Care. This is an automated reply to confirm that we have received your request, and that we are working on resolving your issue(s) as promptly as possible. Your assigned ticket number is .

WILLIAM W,17,5,"I have been using Bitdefender security software for seventeen years and I have never had any issues during that time despite being a heavy user of my notebook and Android smartphone. Furthermore, with Safepay I have successfully managed bank accounts in three different countries. On the rare occasions when I raised a query with the Bitdefender support team it was always provided quickly and effectively with no need for follow-up. I unreservedly recommend Bitdefender's Total Security product and their excellent customer care service."
Lisa M.,1,4,"The program works well does what it should. Very good support online. I had Kaspersky before, which was ok, but wanted something new and am very satisfied with the product. The camera protection must be on otherwise the camera is blocked completely (took me a while to figure out). Called the support hotline for help and the help was just right for the problem. Support was reachable (chat) and friendly and gave exactly the information I needed. Otherwise absolutely no problems!"
Rick O'Neill,1,5,Great products backed by exceptional service! 🐶🇺🇸
Claire,12,5,Best virus protection software out there and their customer support is absolutely brilliant!I'm a very happy customer!
Jus Beaming,2,5,"Consistently get high ratings by online tech sites, it is unobtrusive on my MacBook Pro resources and when there is an issue customer service is very responsive.I highly recommend."
Herman gerards,2,5,"nice program, easy use, fine tools and good service when a issue occurs.and that for an faire price."
Jay,2,5,"I was looking at my Bitdefender order history the other day and noticed that I've been a happy customer for the last few years. Switching over from McAfee to Bitdefender in 2016, I have never looked back. Bitdefender is easy to use, affordable, has great customer service and light on resource across an array of hardware.I work in IT and I know the frustration of managing multiple devices for the entire family. Bitdefender has given me a stress-free approach in protecting Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. I'm confident to say that my family has had zero incident in the last 5 years with Bitdefender. I recommended Bitdefender to my previous workplace and they have switched over as well."
choco,1,5,it's been years that i use bitdefender never had any worriesvery reactive cat support (america)
Tadd,2,4,It's good but maybe lacks some features found in other security solutions
James Piper,5,5,Great value for money. Efficient system. Had minimal interference with systems. Had no breaches of our five devices covered.
Janet L,2,5,"Although I have only just expanded my product set with Bitdefender, I have always been impressed with the way the base product has protected my devices.  I feel quite confident that they will continue to do so."
Thompson Christopher,1,5,I'll go for bitdefender anytime. I don't see any reason to find another when it delivers as promised and as expected. I just have so much trust and confidence when bitdefender is working in the background
Jack C,2,5,"My favourite antivirus software; doesn't bog down my computer, and they seem to be very proactive with it detecting viruses only hours since they were uploaded online"
Mohsan,1,5,"Hello and thank you. When I bought the product, I saw that VPN is also part of the product, but after the purchase, I saw that I could not use more than 200 MB. What is the name of this move?"
Richard Hardy,2,5,"First, how come I went for this program?  I read reviews from different magazines, and, spoke with friends more computer literate than me.  (I had already, definitely, ruled out Kaspersky, although highly rated across the board - for reasons that are irrelevant to this review.)  I read recent reviews of security suites from Computer Shopper, and, PC Plus magazines.  Interestingly, Computer Shopper hadn't included Bitdefender in their comparison review; however the April 2020 edition of PC Plus had a review of Bitdefender Internet Security 2020.  Would suggest reading PC Plus's review, to get an idea of all the features etc - they gave Bitdefender 5-stars, and, their 'Labs Winner' award.  After researching more on the internet, I went for the Bitdefender Total Security 2020; I have subscribed to Bitdefender Total Security for 5 devices, which, for example, allows installation onto mobiles - and, has other benefits.  I like that Bitdender has it's own firewall and low impact on computer resources (I'm running the program on an old Windows 7 PC, and, an old'ish very low spec' Windows 10 PC) - no problems at all.  I also like that very simple to use, yet has lots of features that I'll probably grow into as I become more familar with the program.  Also, the trust I have for the program is growing: for example, after a recent scan, it told me that a 'critical' Microsoft Update was missing - I hesitated to allow Bitdefender to install it ('Microsoft Update' reported as being up to date) - anyways, deep breath, I allowed it to install, and, certainly had no issues subsequently.  I love the 'notifications' given - which are easily accessed.  Bitdefender reports when it updates (frequently) which connections it has blocked and why, any vulnerabilities etc etc.  So easy to access and understand.  I feel reassured that it has two 'modules' which help resist and 'defeat' ransomware - which is built into the program; again, very reassuring.  Enough - I would go on and on otherwise; but there is another reason for my being pleased with Bitdefender - its customer service! Without going into details - I messed up the activation process, and, other things.  Eventually, I emailed Bitdefener Customer Service - who replied pretty quickly - about 7 hours - with step-by-step precise instructions, which even I could follow!  Problems solved.  Their email was very professionally polite, efficient and effective - I was, and still am, very impressed.  So for all sorts of reasons, I would recommend Bitfender - I trust them, and, think I'm in good hands.  Richard"
Brian Brotschi,1,5,My first experience with the products & service have been exceptional.
Pasqualini,2,5,"I moved from Norton to Bitdefender, and I haven't looked back."
Artem Bagdasaryan,1,5,My daughter and I have been using your program for many years. Very satisfied and will continue. I tell everyone that Bitdefender is the best antivirus. I recommend to everyone.
cog23,2,5,"I like Bitdefender.  It is user-friendly; easy to install as well as operate; plus, I can set it up exactly the way I want it to work on my system.  And every time I have asked a question through support, they have responded promptly and with the exact info to deal with my question.  Plus, it loads very quickly at startup, much better than McAfee and Norton which I have used in the past.  The VPN premium might be a little more expensive than some others, but given all the advantages listed previously, I don't think that is a problem.  I prefer Bitdefender to either of those."
William Sambu,1,5,"Light-weight, optimal & automated. It would be a waste of time not to install this product in your devices."
Abdullah,1,5,If you search for a package to secure your Android or devices this the best one they have a lot functions from deep scan to VPN so you can browse safely.

James Williams,1,5,"Have used other programs that are well known but Bitdefender Detailed reporting gives me confidence nothing gets by their system and I feel confidant that Bitdefender will only continue to make improvements and offer protection that others will only try to imitate. Also made it easy to provide coverage for all WiFi components at home that matter. Thank you, JW"
Peter,1,5,For me Bitdefender is the best!This is my opinion!RESPECT!
Ali ALKUFA,1,5,"I used to suffer from a lot of problems in my personal computer due to exposure to viruses, but thank God, since I used your program for more than five years, I no longer suffer from these problems. I wish you success in your work."
paul quinn,1,5,Quick and easy to understand what was purchased.  Economical value compared to others.  Good reviews as well.
Wayne Butler,13,5,"Bitdefender Antvirus Plus provides very useful additional features including  a ""safe shopping browser"" and limited use VPN (can be increased at a premium) The system is easy to use and if needed there is prompt help avaialable by e-mailing their support team.When your antivrus is due for renewal I strongly recommend you consider them for their excellent system and great service"

hicham hmamy,1,5,Good product and customer services for a reasonable price.
Terry Hodgson,1,5,"I needed a product that would help secure my home network and warn me about a virus, someone trying to hack my network, or simply let me know when I browse a site that could prove to be harmful. It also contains  ransomware feature that gives me much needed piece of mind."
Mike,1,5,"Great product & great tech support, if you need it."
Onenergy,1,5,"When you find a communications security company that inspires confidence based on their dedication to customer service and technology innovations, you want to join in and support them  enough to stay on top and head of security threats.

Mike Matthews,1,5,Great software and support. Really satisfied with my Bitdefender security on my computer systems. Very reliable and easy to use.
Jonas Hansson,1,5,"I am a computernerd who loved breaking codes in the 80ies, build my own pcs in 90ies, understand The Matrix in 2000, when i sold suns supercomputers on unix.I have tested and used most security and cracktools.Bitdefender has proven to be the perfect mix of solid virus protection, where both advanced and beginner users have tools and autopilot to depend on.Bitdefenders VPN was better then I first saw. The VPN didnt hide you from everything.I understood why after used banking, online shopping and protecting my private emails.The VPN didnt hide from the service. Only calls and snoopers. Even google analytics!I never been a bitdefender costumer before.I am now. All my systems with the biggest license for a year.I highly recommend this product.Jonas Hansson Datacenter Design Arcitect44 years, Gothenburg"
Chris Robinson,1,5,"I had been happily using the free version of Bitdefender Virus Scanner for months when it suddenly crashed for no apparent reason. Having tried to re-install it, for it to be back up running as previously experienced, I found that was not the case: There was a problem with the final scan stage; it was failing to undertake the scan within the usual time frame. Consequently I sent an email to the Bitdefender Support team and found them extremely helpful and efficient in rectifying the issue. I have no hesitation in recommending their services for peace of mind."
Djkurly Blue,1,5,Very good and proficient software that easily detects threats and minimises risk to your pc.
xam maharg,1,1,"The Bitdefender ordering app is set up to confuse requests in ordering. When the antivirus program is chosen to purchase, it is deceptively placed on the bottom of the page in a rose highlight. In the bold ""add to cart"" prompt, there is an ""unwanted"" Bitdefender antivirus product added in the cart, once  added I had to call and have the program purchased - debited to my bank account - reversed, and that took over a week to be credited back. The service I purchased has up to three devices available for download, it doesn't  specify that they are only downloadable on Microsoft devices, a  big  issue developed when I downloaded the antivirus program to my Android phone regardless as to whether the antivirus is for Microsoft OS devices or not the process downloaded a program that connected my android phone to my Microsoft OS for messaging and phone calls, this is where we get into the weeds.  The program deviated from the normal or what could be expected and I opened up app's in settings to uninstall the program, in that uninstall, anything that should or would do so was grayed out and prevented an uninstall. On the first call to Bitdefender I was  told I would be sent an email with instructions to send a log file to Bitdefenders techs to resolve the problem. I never received their email and contacted them the following day I was sent an email meant...  I suppose to fix the problem - remember the wonky ""suspect"" virus app? - the URL to send the log file was grayed out and wouldn't send. I called and reported the issue without an determination. I eventually copied and pasted the URL to my browser and the program that was supposed to upload a log file for Bitdefender techs to scan - I just expected to upload a log file - started to upload like mad, when it got to my folders I canceled the download and immediately requested a refund. My photo folder was tampered with and - or - what ever else was done I don't have a clue. Bidefender is promoted as the best in its class. Analytics are done and compared and this virus protection is given a grade. What they don't do is inspect any suspicious actions which would be deemed insidious machinations, and which should absolutely be scrutinized and overseen by an independent agent in respect to regards such as are outlined here. One more - and last thing -  all actions taken in issues with Bitdefender antivirus are done with impunity by an foreign agency,  not domestic with the same oversights established in the US. It is my opinion: as such, it can be, and should be, taken at face value... information and resources are exploited by those charged with protection and control."
Barry Mead,5,5,"So far it has proven very effective, good system and timely and helpful support"
Brian Withers,6,5,Used Bitdefender for a couple of years and it keeps my system runnig clean .
federico silva,3,5,
Chimpu Fernandez,2,5,"Using bitdefender total security for over 6 months now. Very good product, light on pc resources.Feature rich product, quick detection.Would definitely recommend using this product for windows 10 pc/laptop.11/05/2020."
Wojtek Skupien,1,5,"Above all, anti-virus and network protection does the work with the message. Most competitors just notify and then I have to decide. Clear interface. And a wallet with passwords useful."
Cerberus Cobra,1,5,The best Antivirus suite I've ever used. Using Bitdefender since 2013 till present. Keep it that way Bitdefender team! and do more online sales. I would definitely subscribe.
Abdo Istanbouli,1,5,"Highly Recommended. It could find defects and vulnerabilities in my device that no other software could do it! Bit defender is Reliable, Trusted and super user friendly to use and perfect after sales customer service."
Charlie Glew,6,1,"Pretty disappointed with this package from bit defender, I got 2 years coverage over ""3 devices"" although after buying/downloading it, it covered the other 2 devices apart from my primary for 14 day(not 2 years) like mentioned before I bought it plus my internet isn't the strongest so they won't cover it and advise I upgrade and spend more money! unlike free antivirus brands you get, I've gone with avast on a two years and i've had no issue."
JSeb,14,5,"I'm using Bitdefender products since a lot of years.  I never regret this choice. It works nicely and it's considered as a top choice for customers by most experts. And, the company offers a great support to its customers. I strongly recommend it."
Valerie Clapp,1,5,"Excellent service, reasonable wait times for live chats and ALL questions are answered to your satisfaction! Love this product, especially the SafePay when ordering online."
Chuck Lucas,1,5,I am amazed at the value of Bitdefender.  I have the Macintosh protection.  Tech support has always been outstanding with a real person.
Vince Clancy,1,5,Been with them for a while and they have continued to improve their software AND their service.
Ian Mcrae,11,5,"First time I have had to contact Bitdefender with a query, pretty much expecting the usual long time before I got an answer, and the answer not actually answering the question I asked .... but that's not how it worked out.  Swift reply, which answered my question in a clear and simple fashion.  I'm new to this company's products, but on the present showing, I'll be staying with them."
Brian Brand,8,1,"Another rubbish AV system, that despite turning off all notifications continually pesters you to sign up to their VPN. Well when the year is up I will be gone. Continually claims my WIFI network is unsafe which is absolute rubbish. GEt a grip with what you call service, there is none"
Mr  Higgin,9,5,
Duncan G,2,1,"Genuinely appalling customer support.The renewal of license was automatic, but did not update in the app automatically. When I tried to update the app manually I couldn't remember the password so went through the password reset option. No password reset email ever arrives. Contacted customer support and entered a 2 month long loop of customer support agents who clearly were not reading my submissions and just repeatedly sent one of two different template responses.After two months without an antivirus and no help for customer support I requested a refund. I was told that no refund was possible. I was outside the 30 days refund option and that I should read their terms of sale. Either this was a rather cynical deflection or their customer service are not aware that the if their product doesn't work/is not delivered their contract is non-relevant. The customer has right to refund. I requested to speak to a manager. I got more deflection and refusals and finally was informed that to address my request I needed to call customer support. I called customer support to be told that they physically could not authorise a refund and that I would need to call Bitdefender directly (they're clearly outsourcing their customer support - what was the point in telling me to call a number that couldn't issue a refund?) I insisted at that point on speaking to a manager. I was put on hold for a full half hour only to be told that 'no supervisors are available' but that they suddenly could issue a refund and that has been done for me. So what was the point in putting me on hold for half an hour phoning a London number if in fact the refund could have been processed half an hour ago?In all fairness the Bitdefender product is good at what it does. But if you're going to go with Bitdefender you best pray you don't ever need even the most basic of support from their team, lest you become trapped in the circular hell of template responses, legal mis-directions and uncooperative support that I have. I'll never use Bitdefender again."
Michael,1,5,It is the best
Jim Parks,1,5,I am new to this program but I think it will do what I want it to do. Protect my computers better than the last program I had.
Joe Pilkus,2,5,"If you reach Emma, Marian, or Ovidiu, your request will be handled with courtesy and professionalism.  I experienced an issue with my computer and over the course of two hours, across multiple chats, they greatly assisted me and resolved the series of issues."
M Bledsoe,1,4,"For this review, I have it installed on a Netgear wireless router.  Overall I like the product.  It appears to work transparently to the end user.  I get reports for new device appearing on the network and when something is blocked."
LlamaBoy,4,5,i was trying to compile a simple hello world program in c but but defender blocked the compiled executable. I sent the file as a false alarm and no less than five minutes later i was able to compile and run the program without bit defender getting in my way.
Jim,1,5,"Bitdefender is reliable, responsive and effective, especially for all of my Apple devices."
Thomas J,6,5,"I give Bitdefender 5 Stars because  they have protected my 5 Devices with first class Security, Also I had reason to ring them for help on a few occasion's and they made me feel that I was an important customer thank you Thomas"
John Spieker III,1,5,
William Pitt,1,5,"Netgear Armor by Bitdefender is the best value proposition in the market today. Not only does it add true firewall capabilities to your router but it includes a Bitdefender license for ALL household devices behind that router. Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Phones (Mac and Windows, and Android) all covered with one annual fee which makes it the best value proposition on the market today but includes licenses for the Gold Standard of AV/Malware protection. This is the first time a vendor has gotten me to part with my money for a suite, but this package is worth every penny and Netgear Armor by Bitdefender has earned its money and has a new long term customer."
Peter Dervik,3,1,"They were kind of ok. Not the cheapest. Didn't have any real use for it after the first year, though.  This is when the constant patronising barraging emails started.  Daily, telling me that I should renew.  That I made a smart decision a year ago, I should make it again.  That I should also consider auto-renewal because it's hassle free (not at all because I'm more likely to forget to cancel if I don't use it).  I followed the link to stop receiving renewal prompt emails, and it simply took me to the renewals page, ""You have made an excellent choice!""Then I came on here to look at the other reviews, see if people had similar issues, and saw a stream of what I would consider clearly fake 5* reviews.  It all seems very sketchy now, and I wouldn't trust them again."
UdrescuMilin Vlad,1,5,Finally an antivirus which offer you protection on the Internet. I feel safe.
garnapo lee,1,5,Bit Defender' products worth rated 5 stars.......Why not try.....?
Harsha S,1,5,"Amazing product features, very secured, descent dashboard interface, affordable price tag, value for every penny, install once & forget forever, and finally no second thought needed if you have already arrived at this product for purchase."
CrazyJL,1,5,Consistent and reliable protection and support.
Nick,2,5,Contacting Bitdefender Support was one of the best experiences I've had with the support segment of the apps and products I'm using.Fast and comprehensive replies and the best security and features you can find in anti-virus software.

Bhaskaran Pandompatam,1,5,I am happy to be a customer for many years. Feel confident in using by knowing that I can get timely and effective support when I need it.
Peter O'Handley,2,5,"In a market place that has so many programs on computer protection, there is one program that I cannot highly recommend enough and that program is Bitdefender!! The program is smartly thought out and is very easy to use and it is total computer protection for the buck! Yet what puts Bitdefender miles ahead of all the other computer protection programs is their world class Customer service department! I have used Bitdefender for several years and have had issues that range from small to large and complicated issues, Customer Care is wonderful in each issue, caring, thoughtful, professional, and they listened first, I very much appreciated that point!!What makes or breaks a company are its people and Bitdefender has the very best people, as soon as you contact Bitdefender you are answered and the contact occurs in a short time, and hang on for you will be handled with their Customer Care department in a world class manner, professional, with kindness and thoughtfulness and when your issue has been resolved you will agree with me, that it was world class, top notch Customer Service!!!"

Susan Haebig,6,5,Does what it says it will do. I know I am protected.
a,4,1,"I could not wait to end my subscription to Bitdefender. You are unable to set an exact time to run scans. You are unable to stop a task if you want/need to in Task Manager. I had a security breach of a password which I strongly believe could have only come from inside Bitdefender. Today, I am trying to uninstall. I have 'uninstalled' it in Control Panel but the files are still in 'Program files' and I am unable to delete them/the folders they are in as apparently they are in use. I now have to find a solution to that. Do not get if YOU want control over the programs you install on your machine.Edited to add: I have now uninstalled but am being bombarded with emails encouraging me to purchase. If one follows the unsubscribe link in the email it does not unsubscribe - just takes you to a webpage saying you have made an excellent choice! And to bitdefender re scans - you cannot set a specific time, if I wanted to run the scans at 10 am every day I am not able to set anywhere in settings this particular time or any other particular time convenient to me. Re the DEFINITE password security breach - I messaged you straight away at the time about this. I did the logs etc and after several messages backwards and forwards over several days it was not resolved. Although it could ONLY have come from someone that worked for you, you would not accept this. It never was ‘resolved’ when you had the opportunity and I certainly do not want to get into another lengthy exchange over days again."
Cristian Gheorghe,1,5,Best and light AV. Even the support team is one of the best.
Jeff,1,5,Best security software I've ever had. Customer support is always there and will not stop until any prombles are resolved.
Chuck Mancuso,1,5,"We have tried several other malware prevention products in the past. Bitdefender is full-featured, easy to use, competitively priced, and most importantly, has given us perfect protection against any form of malware for over 3 years."
Manolis,3,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for many years now. I can say this is the best solution I've used so far (and still using) and I recommend it to everyone having a new build or asking for AV solutions. Among others, I've used Kaspersky, Avast, Avira, ESET and I can say, it surpasses them in all factors, having very good performance (and not becoming slow with updates) and the least false positives. All of the features work perfect and some integrations like the Password Manager, File Encryption, Webcam protection, Disk Cleanup, Optimizer, etc... are  good plus.For the technical assistance, when I contacted the support they were very professional and the communication was very good. Didn't have any problem with that. For the first response, It took 2 days, although I sent a whole system analysis and it is at least expected to take some time for them to process it. For the VPN, I wouldn't say I'm pleased. The interface is not very rich and it wasn't very reliable when I was connecting from public connection. It still needs some work."
Ronald Seymour,1,5,Bitdefender works great. A little bit of a learning curve but pretty easy to understand.Their customer service is great.
Onur CAGLAR,4,5,Using bitdefender products (mainly total security) for many years and they are the best antivirus i have ever used.
Meshal Alabidi,1,5,"Great overall software, sometimes too strong but i rather have too strong than a weak protection software"
Wayne Rushing,1,5,"After evaluating all of the highest rated software, i started using Bitdefender several years ago.  I find their software provides the very best protection while i notice very little to no presence in terms of system load.  Their customer service, even during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, was really outstanding."
Paul,1,1,I have a small business Bitdefender package someone was able to Hijack the admin console change the email address for the log in to the console so we where unable to log in. They were able to obtain the IP addresses of 2 PC's in different locations and left a disk wipe virus on them. Could not even get support to return to the original user/email address for admin console after 48 hours . Don't waste your time not happy now have to repair two PC's.

Rider of Nye,3,5,"Great price for an excellent package that offers constant updates, is unobtrusive and brings peace of mind to your systems connected to the internet. Quick, friendly, and professional response to any queries."
Steve Davis,26,2,"I have been using Bitdefender Total Security and the premium VPN for a good few years and have found the overall product to be excellent. Recently, however I've had the feeling that it is not keeping up with recent developments in web browsers and they obviously consider they know better than anyone else. In particular the lack of support for the new Edge browser is a real problem which I don't completely understand. The Edge browser is supposedly based on Chrome but won't accept the Bitdefender Wallet extension. I have installed 2 other browsers as a trial and not on the Bitdefender Wallet list (Vivaldi and Brave, both based on Chrome) and found that the Wallet extension works well on both.I'm afraid I will not be renewing my subscriptions to Bitdefender until the Company decide to make an effort to make it compatible with modern browsers and particularly Edge, which has effectively made I.E. obsolete."

Joe Brock,3,3,"While I'm glad the program is working well, it's driving me crazy with all the ""suspicious connection blocked"" popups.  It's constant.  Can't it just do it's job in the background and not tell me every time it blocks something??  Can't seem to find anything in settings do disable these popups!"

They are the SAME instructions that didn't work in the first place.I cancelled my subscription, I'm hoping for a refund."

Im telling everyone about bitdefender and yes all you evil predators out there, youre goin down......mm"
Bill Wise,1,4,Bitdefender doesn't seem to slow my Windows 10 PC like other suites. I use it on my Android phone as well as my mac mini with no issues.
Paul Lambert,1,5,Well happy with this product. In my opinion far superior than Norton 360.
Mor Safa,1,5,Good job!Someone from Bitdefender remote to my pc and solved my problem very professionally.
Lou Valdini,3,5,"Bitdefender is highly functional, easy to set up and use, and delivers the level of protection I need. And if I need help, I can count on the Support team to respond quickly."
Ahmed Appas,1,5,A very reliable and robust anti-virus software with good technical support. And very useful extra utilities.
Manuel Ferreira,1,5,"I've been a Bitdefender Security Software customer for five years or more and as such I recommend it to all who seek such a service. My partner is sometimes impulsive in her Internet surfing and she is not enamored with computer maintenance and Internet security concerns but with the Bitdefender protection I buy for our three systems, she's comfortable with the interface of the program and in all this time we've never had a breech that slipped through to cause harm.I'm a computer hobbyist who enjoys the complex world of such things to my level of ability and with Bitdefender's educational provisions through their tech staff and tutorials, my skills and knowledge of computers and the Internet always improve.My experience with the Bitdefender tech staff either on the phone or via e-mail is always excellent. In a global economy with English as my only language, the Bitdefender staff is also excellent in my language always....in voice or in the written word.Bitdefender is a most familiar program for me now after this long time as a customer and I enjoy the user interface of its graphics and sequencing even as it's evolved as it must. Security software may be boring to many but for me Bitdefender has been fun and always interesting....and I feel secure, fastidious, obsessive me...I feel secure with Bitdefender."
Bill,1,5,Excellent product and responsive customer service. A combination that is hard to find these days.
TWilson2000,16,5,"Excellent service. I take my online security very serouisly;This is why I am very picky when it comes to products that protect me online.I have used many antivrus programs in the past but bitdefender has been my go to since it was recceomended to me. It is light-weight, Has a high decetion rate, You get the same level of protection as there premmuim users just without the extras.This is a compnay i would very much reccomend to anyone and once my services such as my vpn i use etc; I will be seeing what bitdefender offer. :)"
Derek P,1,2,"Antivirus fairly ok, but no option of adware removal, So you pay 70£ annually for the app but adware removal is paid seperately. Find a better deal elsewhere"
Tom Kelly,1,5,"Unbelievable how extraordinarily exceptional every phase of reviewing, purchasing, installing and follow up both with screen sharing and phone conversations this companies people do. There is no comparison to how professional this company is compared to Microsoft, Apple, Sprint etc."
Hank White,1,5,GREAT SERVICE AND EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE....

Fabian,2,3,"A good antivirus, with high resource usage that lets it down."
B Newport,1,5,"Been using Bitdefender for over 2 years now, works flawlessly with Win.10. Fast, customization options, love the ad blocker. Customer service and support is excellent, not that I needed any technical help with the software, but with the renewal of billing. Customer service worked swiftly and were very kind. 5 starts all around!"
Ray,1,5,Best product. Works 24/7 to keep me protected from all kind of IT threats.
Phil Jones,1,4,"Maybe 5 stars , but need more time to evaluate...."
Ken Stapley,1,3,Pricy but at least they did get back and help solve an issue. I hate the fact that there was no voice contact.
Steve Lee,1,5,"Great product, great price and great service if needed."
James,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for 7 years now across my Mac and Windows computers. The security really is the best available. The application is very lightweight, does not overtax my computer resources, and the security coverage is very complete. The tech support is also outstanding. The reps are extremely knowledgeable, very patient, and available 24/7. I cannot say enough about this company."
Gator Hogg,1,5,Awesome technical support and service providing a very efficient product.

Jan Roar Mellembakken,1,5,"I bought Bitdefender for 2-3 years. No problems. Then I bought a new PC 2 moths ago and forgot to install Bitdefender again. Yesterday I received an e-mail with a threat to send videos taken secretly with my webcam during a longer periode, to all my contacts if I didn't pay 1900 USD in Bitcoins to a certain adress. They provided me with the Hotmail password that was correct 2 weeks ago. I installed Bitdefender and contacted their 24/7 support and received immediately a comprehensive, friendly and reassuring solving of my problem. And no new e-mail threats."
Howard,5,4,"If I were the person you went to for finding the best protection for your PC, Mac OS, or iOS, then you would be signing up for service with Bitdefender. I did my homework before selecting them and they were the best option based off of independent lab reviews and online forums. Now I have the experience of exploring and utilizing their main application for both PC and Mac OS, as well as their apps for iOS and I have found Bidefender to be comprehensive in making sure that every aspect of your computer and internet experience to be secure. If you want top tier protection then this is your program. The only reason I give Bitdefender 4 stars and not 5 is due to cost. It can be pricey if you don’t shop around and find a special deal from them or a trusted third party vendor. While I do wish they were a little more affordable, I can truly “understand” at least why it’s expensive. “You get what you pay for” applies to this more than ever. So if you are apprehensive about it because of the price, let me tell you that you aren’t crazy, but with the protection you get it will make sense. Other than that, I have no issues with the performance of the program or apps. Lastly, as a recommendation I would check the system requirements of Bitdefender against what system(s) you plan on installing it on. Slower, or lower tier laptops may find it difficult to run."
Joe Baker,14,5,Highly recommended.  I had a minor issue with annoying notifications that I couldn't disable.  A quick online chat resolved the problem.  Excellent.
Bitexposed,1,1,"Complete garbageNot only does it interrupt and subsequently terminate connection to vital SSL websites such as business banking, it displays features that are alarmingly similar to phishing and otherwise malicious online interactions. -1000/10 would not recommend, please get this crap off my computer."
Dee M,1,5,"Superb app that gives you just what you need, the app is simple but powerful"
Steve Hoosack,3,5,I have utilized Bitdefender for at least the last five years and have never had any difficulty at all.  It is extremely dependable and offers me the peace of mind I desire while utilizing my computer on the web.  It is an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone.
Dhia Qasim,1,5,"It does everything automatically and very efficiently, makes you feel safe all time. very responsive from experts regarding any doubts or inquiry"
Ross Gray,1,2,"Bought the ""internet security 2020"" package and it was completely useless. I purchased the software because I thought that my computer may have been infected as it was not running smoothly and couldn't play games at the same fps as it used to. The antivirus ended up using a ton of cpu and memory all the time at idle and was slowing everything down worse. Then the scans didn't find anything either. It also took far too long to receive the activation code. Avoid this at all costs, just another shady antivirus company that wants to monitor everything on your computer. The only smooth process was getting the refund request sent away. After wading through pages of ""contact support"" forms to find the live chat."
Nicholas Barclay,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for several years now and their customer service has been excellent - I am relatively technically savvy but if you are not I am sure they would be able to resolve issues easily, making this a good choice for someone who might be put off by the potential complexity of installing a security package."
Alex Apetrei,1,5,Emergency response and support from BitDefender has been stellar.
malcolm dyke,21,5,
Buoybells,1,5,"They continue to keep my computer safe.  I'd say they are wee overprotective, and that's okay with me.  I switched to Bitdefender because my previous security program missed a big whammy, and that's when I decided I needed to find a better program.  Bitdefender received excellent reviews, and I purchased their Total Internet Security program.  I'm completely satisfied with how well they look after things and how well they perform daily.  It's just nice to know you have a reliable security program in place.  In these times, that is truly a comfort,"
Why so long?,4,4,"High rating elsewhere.  From personal use:  it apparently functions.  Are its many sub-programs offered--a pageful pops up--necessary and, clearly and in brief, what do they do different than the core program.  Shouldn't we be better warned if suddenly the program goes inert (this happened without notice)?  BUT I'm keeping it as the best I know of, tho not as user-friendly as AVG (but AVG gives more and more ads)."
Skip Stein,1,5,Great Reliable product. Easy to install and use.
jose araujo,11,5,"I use Bitdefender total security, I have never had a problem, they do what they say, Top notch security, and you get what you pay for.I give Bitdefender 5 stars."

Bocai Cosmin,1,5,"Good product, easy to manage and a great support team."
Alex,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender Total Security for years, on pc, mac, and mobile devices. I've been very happy with the security protection (no incident). The price is great (particularly for several devices), and the Customer Service has consistently been prompt, friendly, and useful. (don't know how they do it - it seems like they actually read what you email them, unlike other companies that answer on auto-pilot and it takes n interactions to solve an issue.)"
Stef,2,5,Good product and excellent customer service.
Al,1,5,I found bitdefender very adaptable across all five of my devices Android Windows 10 everything I have it connected to my tablet my phone and three laptops system works perfect never skipped a beat. Keep in mind bitdefender is very aggressive and adaptable bitdefender can be adjust to personal preference manually I love it works very well it also has tutoral videos on how to operated set it up and use it properly. Saved me more than once.
j. raven,1,5,"will be starting my 3rd year with Bitdefender/VPN....nothing has gotten through, unlike the other major virus checkers i tried....also the renewal costs have always been very reasonable...."
Bennie V Crowell,1,5,Bitdefender is an amazing product for using your computer safely on the internet. A suite of tools to eradicate viruses and other malicious software from your system. Support is timely and accurate. Have been a customer for many years and will continue to be one in the future.
Lorraine & Linda,7,5,"I purchased Bitdefender for my desktop Mac and also use it on my iPhone and iPad. My purchase of this service over others was based on the many positive reviews I found on-line, and I have not been disappointed with the functioning and customer service of Bitdefender."
Laura Bluezbaby,1,5,Bitdefender has never disappointed me! It is very user friendly and doesn't slow my computers or mobile devices down like others I have  used in the past. Affordable as well.

Arthur Yee,1,5,Peace of mind security with the product diversities to protect my whole family.
Robert Black,4,5,"Bitdefender is almost always one of the highest rated computer related protection packages you can buy!  I have used it for years, and never had an issue with my protection.  It's not the cheapest, but it seems to be one of the most comprehensive products I have ever purchased for protection.  It is not a resource hog on my computers, and seems to run quietly in the background most of the time.  Highly recommend the Total Security product."
John Wood,4,2,"Cack. Won't switch off, even if you tell it to. I work in IT, I know what I'm doing, but this software refuses to switch off without resorting to uninstalling it. I will buy something else instead that works like it's meant to"
Charlene,1,5,"For those of us that the computer age is not second nature, Bitdefender removes a lot of the difficulty navigating the internet safely.  Their instructions are easy to follow and their customer care is by far more helpful and friendly than others I have had encounters with."
Uğur DURU,1,1,3 months trial advertising is made about the actual time 14 days an unreliable company
Rajarshi Chattopadhyay,1,5,"Bitdefender is the undisputed ruler of consumer grade security solution. It provides airtight malware protection, excellent system resource management, 24×7 active customer care support and a lot of useful system optimization tools. But, I think pure anti virus protection is the segment where bitdefender truly shines."
Jose Marie Osorio Trangco,1,5,Bitdefender is always THE BEST and real 5 Star Defender of all time!!!

Vadim,2,5,
G Nichol,1,5,"Many times I have had to call a products customer service and was put thru a standardized script of questions that I had already asked my self while trying to solve the problem. This didn't happen with Bitdefender. My question may have been simple but the answer was correct the first time, which saved me a lot of down time. The issue was not with the software as it does exactly what I need it to do and them some. I am completely satisfied with the product and service."
William Gush,1,5,"good customer service with polite, knowledgeable staff. told me step by step how to fix the problem with patience because I'm not computer literate."
Dieter Hauser,1,3,Would have rated it 5 stars if it were a stand alone software. I will not subscribe to any service that has a monthly fee. I have had Bitdefender for quite a while and liked it when it was stand alone. I still use the old version but I have to copy and paste my logins.
Tom Prater,1,1,I have a few pages I have made and when I try to access them Bitdefender tries to stop me.HORRIBLE SOFTWARE   ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
eric fritsch,1,5,"I am confident in BitDefender's devotion to and ability to protect my security and privacy from online attack,and, furthermore, that BitDefender's Support Staff is courteous, patient and knowledgeable, and easy to work with.

Angel Montes de Oca (joesatriani10),2,5,"Awesome, I have 15 licenses for my personal use, and also 600 at company I work for, I can trust to Bitdefender, I also advise my friends to buy it"

Frank,2,5,The IT Representative talked to me on the phone for a considerable period of time to assure the installation went as it should. The program meets all expectations and I have tried many others which did not. Frank
Dennis Loef,1,5,I had a serious problem and here again Bitdefender Support Service pulled me true in 30 minutes after the initial response mail thanks Eduard.
Joseph Smith,1,5,"I had a problem with my computer and had to revert to factory stage so I lost my virus checker and internet protection.  I called Bitdefender and customer care calmed me down and the agent said, ""let me see how I can help you"", and he did, brilliant"
RJ,1,2,"I've used Bitdefender Total Security for many years and been pretty happy with them, even recommended them.Recently I've noticed they failed to scan for and remove even the simplest of malwares that I was able to do manually.Any method to contact them to tell them of this issue is broken, ticket support is broken because submitting the ticket turns into an infinite loading loop. I got blocked on the forums because I used the word ""disappointed"" or compared their results to MalwareBytes. I don't actually fully know why, but at least I know I'm blocked and trying to get them to improve their product doesn't work.Can't recommend this product or this company anymore unfortunately, I really wish I could, but I honestly can't, and I don't want to look for a new antivirus software but I guess I have to now."
Alan Mills,1,5,Tried most of the security providers but always come back to Bitdefender
Martijn van Dam,2,1,"When i discovered that Bitdefender charged 60 euro from my bank account i've asked them to refund the amount they took from an auto-renewal. I received an email after 10 minutes that the purchase was fully refunded and i was getting the refund up to 7 working days.After 10 working days i contacted them again because i didnt receive the refund they promised. They responded that they needed extra payment information because it was a direct debit payment.I provided them the information they asked for and then i received a mail that 2checkout blocked the refund; ""In cases of Direct Debit, the refund request can be processed only after a 6 weeks period from the payment date, period needed for the bank process settlement to complete. We will only review and respond to these refund requests after the 6 weeks period ends.""Bitdefender lied to me in the first mail that the purchase was fully refunded and let me wait till i contacted them again. This is very customer unfriendly.  Bitdefender advertises on their website that the fastest way for a refund is contacting the support team (5 working days) instead of doing a chargeback. Well, that isnt the case. C'mon, 6 weeks!?"

Bimsy,1,5,"Very simple and easy to use, good price."
GeorgeViol,4,5,"Bitdefender is the best antivirus I have ever used in my life.The cost of the Subscription is really affordable.The program works smoothly without any problems.Also, the Support Team is really responsive, helpful and kind to help you find solutions to your problems."
Maithe Ng,1,4,disappointed that every year I have to connect with your customer service dept to tell them that my subscription is NOT expiring because I ALWAYS renew my subscription way before it expires.
Joe Ernst,4,5,"Had a recent glitch that I thought was driven by Bitdefender.  It was Microsoft  (go figure).  Bitdefender customer care gave me a rapid solution and once I understood the problem, I could fix the issue myself."
Bob Roby,1,5,"I've used Bitdefender for a couple years and it has always worked unobtrusively. I installed it on a new computer and had a problem interacting with Dropbox because I was linking up to many email addresses. I sent an email to Bitdefender late Friday afternoon. Less than two hours later I received a suggested fix, which I used to solve the problem. I think that is great service."
customer,3,5,"Bitdefender offers so many features that others don't have. It's easy to install and if you have issues, the support team is very prompt and gives easy to understand and follow advice."
Harry Bach Madsen,8,5,"Right or wrong asking these strong people, then it's your turn to be stronger"
Deanna King,1,5,"I've used Bitdefender for several years.  It is dependable and easy to use.  There are updates for threats throughout the year.  I can purchase one time and put it on 5 devices, including my laptop, phone, desktop computer and iPad. I also purchased unlimited VPN.  Especially nice for using in restaurants, hotels and airports.  I feel like Bitdefender always has my back."
blue Marquez,1,5,"i""m not a techie person and dont know much about computers, internet, softwwares, installers, etc. but things were made easy for me by your support and assistance."
K A,3,5,"Easy to Use and Great Protection! The interface is simple and easy to use, plus the protection is amazing! It keeps your computer safe and will warn you about unsafe websites so you can avoid them. Its full scan is extensive and the total security is definitely worth the price! Especially since you get to use it on 5 devices by default - your phone, tablet, computer, and can even share with friends or family - or you can get a 10 device option. Plus, the free version of Bitdefender is better than most paid antivirus programs. It may not have total security with the free version, but its protection is still amazing! Definitely worth it and it's very secure for when you do online banking and things like that to keep your accounts and information safe! I will never use a different antivirus! I've used Bitdefender for years and will continue to use it!"
Devan Nambiar,8,3,"I have been with Bitdefender from 2018. I don't understand their automatic renewals policy. They always offer discounts for new customers but not for clients who automatically renew. What makes it ridiculous is that the difference is quite substantial. Perhaps they assume that those who sign up for automatic renewals are not very smart people. My renewal is less than a month away and I just turned off the automatic renewal option. Since then, I am experiencing a spike in notifications of ""Suspicious Connection Blocked."" I have been getting as many as nine notifications a day, whilst previously for days and months I had none. Is this just a coincidence or is there more to it? Looks like the viruses are working hard to make sure I renew with Bitdefender."
Danny,2,5,"very satisfied with BitDefender, one of the most important things to run a successful business is providing the best customer service, something BitDefender fully understands. it took a while for us to fix the problem because BitDefenderTheta was just released and there was some uncertainty as to whether the wrong False / Positive detection of our software on Virus Total could be whitelisted. it is quickly resolved. We wish BitDefender all the best in the future!"
Marion Rogers,12,5,"Love this virus protection, works quitely in the background, notifies you of any problems,uses hardly any battery consumption, excellent customer service"
Carol Welch,1,2,"If you purchase this product with the intention of installing it on multiple devices, know that every device it is installed on will have to LOG IN to the original Bitdefender account to activate it.  If you don't want those people knowing your login and account information, you'll need to have those devices where you can get to them or it will not work.  I think this is a bad design, especially given that they provide you with a link to send out to your other people/devices."
Bob Davison,2,5,"Reviewed just about everything available.  Consistenly good reviews with BD.  Easy to purchase, install and operate.  Several support questions answered quickly.  Great experience so far."
Lorenzo V,4,5,

Aidy,1,5,"Bitdefender customer service & sales always top notch!Sales team are on the ball for returning customers, and the support team are good too whenever they've been needed (which is few and far between)."
Renis Parruca,1,5,Perfect antivirus.. Perfect protection and fast response for resolving problems
Gary Earl,13,5,BitDefender were highly regarded in online reviews of Internet Security providers and they provided immediate feedback to help me install Internet Security.My previous provided Norton were happy to take my money but failed to provide any help.
Aviva,1,5,I am always calm that my problem will be solved. And it is.
Bret,1,1,"A bit shocked to see many positive reviews for this inept company. I have been pleased with Norton, Kaspersky, Emsisoft & Avira. I then fell for a Black Friday special & tried this disastrous software. Customer support is slow and inept. Virus came through while having this installed. The virus was never detected through repeated scans. I knew the CPU was malfunctioning and was able to mill through before locating & removing it myself. This would be difficult for many users to do. I quit using this AV even though I still had time remaining. No need to continue down that path for me or anyone else."
sasĥa ercegovac,1,5,Very good.Product Mobile Security Bitdefender and company very good.
Aaron Swift,1,1,"Absolutely appalled by the timescale and lack of communication for being overcharged.My subscription was close to being due and they wanted to charge me nearly £80 for 10 devices. Like most, I waited for a better deal...Hey presto, a week later, I was offered their Total package at £39.99 for 10 devices. This is what I paid the previous year,  so I thought ok, let's do it....After purchasing this offer, I was then presented with an advert minutes later offering me 15 devices for £36.00!!!Well of course I wasn't happy to say the least... I immediately contacted live chat to be told I would be redirected to the sales team, who would get back to me....After a number of days, I received an email offering me a £3.99 refund or 3 months extra, which did I want?I emailed a response straight back to ask if this was in addition to the upgrade of 15 devices, that I had previously been offered via their advertising through the Bitdefender software, that is installed on my computer.After a number of days, I am still waiting on a response from Bitdefender...Come on Bitdefender... this is not good enough after sales in 2020!!!!!!I will update their reply...should I recieve one..UPDATEBitdefender did resolve my issue but it did take a couple of days after I posted this for them to get back to me. I am happy with Bitdefender and the software it provides, however the after sales needs to improve with timescales it takes them to get back to you.Software - 5 StarsAfter sales- Requires Improvement"
Stephanie Mills,2,5,"Bitdefender is rated #1.  The price is very good.  I get short messages keeping me informed.  Best of all, I can talk to a real live person with any questions I have, and I get real live answers.  Everyone has been very knowledgable, helpful, and kind to me."
Piotr Klimaszewski,1,5,"Maybe I haven't had too much experience with other antiviruses but nevertheless I think Bitdefender is a very good investment if you're looking for reliable, fast and ""not bloated"" security on any of your devices.You can always get a refund within first 30-days of subscription, so it's another good reason to try it for yourself."
Dipak,1,4,"It is great experience with BD, Iam new user, I had used Other Total security but I find that BD is very strong, I vote for 5 Star after my more experience with it.   Two difficulties i find, Thats why I have to contacted to care.1, On dashbord tab i couldnot find care contact number.2, In multiuser case I must have login details of mine, but In our case care person told me that I have have to use login details of First User who login first."
Tucker B.,1,5,"As a relatively non-technical person, I rely on Bitdefender to keep my devices safe.  I have also had great responses and resolution using their Support Staff - easy to contact, prompt resolution.I particularly like the VPN Premium service and it is well worth the approx. $40 annually to be able to browse and participate with no concerns over tracking and location.  Having been doxxed once was enough, and since then I use Bitdefender Total protection plus the VPN Premium."
Cary Opteris,2,2,"I hate it!  Our IT guy keeps installing it when we get computers, even though he knows I've had to take it off before!  It slows down all my work and won't let me move emails to file folders.  It wastes so much time!  Surely there is a good virus protection that lets a person actually get their work done!"
Timothy Martin,1,5,I like the interface and overall experience.  It is offering useful features and suggestions without being confusing or too obtrusive.
Sarunas Slekys,4,1,Very frustrating customer service. Took an hour just to reach online customer service and then completely useless. Took another hour and nothing solved
Carlos Gomes,1,5,I'm a Laymen when it comes to computer security. along with their support center Bitdefender's products makes it easy and gives me peace of mind
Ciara Kennedy,2,5,"Ciara Josephine here from Co. Cork Ireland. A friend of mine who is a web developer highly recommended that I download bitdefender last night to give extra protection to my Mac. He described it as an amazing product with really cool and useful features such as drop and scan files. I was blown away by the customers service, level of support and professionalism from the customer service team when I was looking for help when downloading Bitdefender. I would highly recommend it."
Russell Rendall,1,5,"Bitdefender is a brilliant, easy to use product that I have great faith in. I had one small technical issue and the Service Department were only too happy to help. Overall an excellent product with first class backup and support. I can not recommend this product and company highly enough."
Paul Herendeen,1,5,"Superb customer support.I had an issue where I'd somehow created (and purchased) two separate accounts (cuz, you know, that's the way I roll). When I realized the problem I canceled the renewal on the first account. But then I couldn't get the second account to activate without a code that I'd long since lost. They responded to my request for help within 20 minutes and worked with me through three emails over 30 minutes to resolve the issue. They were fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Couple that with the product working so seamlessly with my MacBook Pro, I'll never buy another product."
Sukreevan,1,5,"Believers are not spoiled, we can buy and use these for the protection of our own good."
Umar Ba'aba,1,5,Bitdefender is simply the best when i compare it with 2 among the best i.e norton and kaspersky
Edwin Tampubolon,1,5,"They have reasonable price for the package. After sales support also very responsive. Whole my devices (Mac, android, iPad) protected by bitdefender."
Motasem,1,5,"For the third year I'm using Total Security at home, office & mobile, I feel safe while Bitdefender does the hard work to protect me.Using the wallet, VPN, & Ransome protection make it really perfect, browsing the internet safely, I'm using my bank account,  shopping, billing & payment with more confident.Bitdefender will really support your back !!!"
Jeff Sanderson,1,5,"I find the Bitdefender products to be easier to use and manage than other similar products. In addition, Box and Total Protection filter more attacks and do it more consistently with fewer problems than other top sold products. VPN is a great product."
Bernard Houle,1,4,I was very satisfied with customer services and technical support
Frank,1,5,Bitdefender is a wonderful product with wonderful support!
Gordon Holmes,7,5,"Problem of my own making was delt with quickly and with simple instructions, all you want. A1"
Keith Springford,2,5,"Had bitdefender for a few years now,I I find it a super product,it does what it says on the pack.I had a minor problem after my last subscription update (no monitor widget on the desktop) I contacted customer care,they came back to me very quickly and gave me a solution that put everything right.thank you Bd."
D.B.Sterling Finland,1,5,I had a problem installing old version Bitdefender.The instructions were simple and easy to follow. - I was able very quickly to remove the previous program and install Bitdefender anew.The service exceeded my expectations!  Many thanks!
Richard Frantz,1,5,"They do there job better then any one, Best support ever, software that dose not kill your system. I have tried other makes of security programs and have been disappointed by them all. I have used Bitdefender products for over 15 years and would recommend there products to any one and every one."
Andrew Hastings,7,5,"Knowledgeable, professional and customer experience-focused care team"
Vincent,8,5,"Fast efficient customer service, product does it's job without being to vocal."
Vanchai,1,5,"I have used bitdefender total security for almost 2 year now and found it to be excellent program that keep my computer clean from any threat, the only thing that I would like is ability to be able to one click to temporary shut down the program because  it interfere with some task that I have to do such as system restore, every time I used the system restore it said it not be able to restore the system because the antivirus program preventing it. But overall the program is the excellent program to use."
JON WRIGHT,1,5,"I have been helped during a fairly technical because of 3 different operating systems: MSWindows 10, Android and iOS, but all my devices were successfully loaded with Bitdefender Total Security installation and then BD Tech Support assisted to install their VPN Premium. During the next year since then, these Bitdefender applications have worked perfectly and provided me with a very secure feeling. Tech support 24/7 was key in my decision and have used this service in middle of the night and early mornings and have received 100% solutions to my problems. Their Techs are well trained, friendly and will pass you straight away to area specialists if your problem is complex or unusual. Callbacks are prompt if needed. They provide written instructions by email if your actions are needed to rectify the problem. I will definitely renew/extend both BD Total Security and VPN Premium coverages when they expire en 2021. I am completely happy with these BD Products, but the big, big plus is when you need critical help and receive concerned and informed BD Tech Support to help you resolve your problems and needs punctually - Bitdefender understands and respects your urgencies and they are available when you need them - you don't have to wait 24 or 36 hours as I have had to do with some manufacturers and big-name software houses."
Mac Berger,3,5,"Bitdefender, they are the best!"
Ralph Tanner,2,5,
Bjarne Bak,25,5,"Tried several AntiVirus solutions over the years, and most of them ended up by blocking access to the outside world for my my favorite programs. Most AntiVirus programs evolved in record time into the bloatware department and the user friendliness left the building alongside some famous guy. Bad user interfaces is surely distancing the developer from the user, and I do not whant to take a doctors degree in bad-information-and-communication-skills just to understand what a poorly manufactured program it trying to tell me. What was once intuitive and easy to figure out is suddenly a tangled mess. Programmers really took something that generally worked pretty good and made it into something terrible to live with. I get annoyed by the superfluous, and moves on.Latest I have tried the freeware version of Bitdefender, and just upgraded to the Plus version. And what a nice and easy user interface it comes with. Does what it does best plus there's never a doubt that I know what it does. I like this Bitdefender AntiVirus hoping no one mess it up over the years. It highly recommendable if you need a fresh start."
David,31,2,"Just purchased 3 years cover for 5 devices for the so called ""Total Security"", well after down loading the software I found out that the VPN element which is advertised is limited to 200 MB per device, and if you want more its £30 a year per device. Advertising misleading as no mention of ""Premium VPN"", choose an alternative like Trend Micro or similar.If VPN is part of the product as purchased it should be clear what is and is not included, it is an old fashioned con."
Jessica W/Grillagas,1,5,Their Customer Service was exceptional.  I only communicated through email and it was simple.  They were able to resolve my issue with flawless response time and politeness.  Highly recommend.  They are reasonably priced as well. HIGH FIVE BITDEFENDER.
T. N,1,5,"Very fair and transparent attitude. Could not recognize any hidden marketing sense so far. I did see in real how Bitdefender protected me from attacks. WOW! Maybe Android application has somehow less functionality regarding security options, but still definitely recommend Bitdefender products and wish you to be so protective as you are! Respect!"
Laurence Barrett,19,5,"Had a problem with the auto renewal process as I had renewed early.  It was sorted within minutes via ""Chat"" the customer services agent went out of her way to sort the problem and got me a refund within an hour directly into my account.  First rate customer service"
Mac,2,5,"I have used Bitdefender for about three (3) years now. As a retired professional engineer having worked in environments where cyber security has been crucial, I feel the Bitdefender designers and the well evolved 24/7 telephone, email, live chat support team are well deserving of highest quality standards in terms of the effectiveness of the software, ease of use, customer support, and most of all keeping abreast of the latest cyber security threats in web browsing or offline use. I have used several other cyber security suits during the course of my career and at home. In contrast, Bitdefender has proved to be most efficient in terms of ease of setup, availability of integrated utilities, and overall functionality without compromising excessive/redundant load on the CPU."
kPunshon,11,5,Great product that protects my computer from the threats of the world today with a great price and super support.  What more do you need.
Poul Rand,1,5,A positive experience with a nice interface that works from day one. It does not take to many resources when scanning and the VPN is fairly fast.
Kathryn Edwards,1,5,"Highly recommendI had to call for assistance since I missed an email that would have provided an activation code. I had the most patient, professional, knowledgeable CSR walk me thru every minor detail and tolerated my very raspy voice. I'm very impressed and appreciative of such great service. Thank you!"
Zander Dreyer,1,5,Excellent customer service. Handled my request extremely fast. Highly recommended. Will definitely continue buying their products!
Nico Van Der Merwe,2,5,Users can be assured of a great anti-virus package that works trouble-free for about any amount of devices. It is easy to solve problems if / when they arrive. I am very happy with Bitdefender.
Carleton Croft,2,5,
Doug,1,5,Top notch. I scan with MalwareBytes every 2-3 months and in the worst case it only finds 1 or 2 PUPS. Usually it never finds anything
John Baumgartner,2,5,"Bitdefender is an awesome product, and the support team is very friendly and professional!"
Grace Hall,1,5,"I have had Bitdefender Total Security for over 2 years now and would sincerely recommend  this product. It  is easy to use, doesn't slow down my computer, is fast and the results of a scan are easy to understand.  Also there are useful tools to help you keep your computer running good. I have tried other products before but this is the best of all. Highly recommend this."
Suman Lama,3,4,Very friendly service and professional. Prompt response.Great antivirus software good price. My computer is secure.Thank you
Tony,4,1,"When you buy Bitdefender you re not a customer; you are merely an extension of their processes. I raised a question concerning a questionable cookie. Apart from automated replies I was totally ignored despite at least 6 further contacts restating the original simple question, pointing out that my question was being ignored and asking for a refund. Worst possible customer support imaginable. Running a Quickscan is pointless because Bitdefender accepts that that doesn't prove anything. You have to run a full system scan - amongst other things.I had better support from the Free Antivirus supplier I was using before I chose Bitdefender. Don't even think of buying if you think you might have aproblem at some time."
Mike Horner,1,5,Relatively easy to install and update. User friendly screens and helpful chats when needed.  I have had no issues with my computers securities with BitDefender installed
DJ SKI,1,5,"The product is awesome given that its protective features, its lack of intrusiveness and ease of use are what I deem to be the best. It provides excellent value for money as several devices can be protected at low cost and the customer services are par none. Definitely recommended!"
Martin Montney,1,5,
Rich,2,3,"Asked them to refund the amount they took from an auto-renewal (which I then disabled) - instead of promptly doing so they eventually responded asking me to instead choose between two revised offers they wished to make (no mention of the refund). So had to email them again asking them to refund the auto-renewal, as originally requested, which they finally did. The product is fine, just a hassle that customers need to repeatedly request that the company honour their 30-day money back guarantee."
Zakolyte,1,5,"When hope is totally non-existent and their service team returns with an, ""Let's see what we can do...""  You think Nah...no chance!Then they go well beyond and exceed your expectations...you have to say that their Customer Service is populated with humans and extremely well trained.  They resolved my issue and I could sense, took joy in helping me.I tip my hat and have to say...they have earned me as a long term customer.  That and a great product, our home PC's have never been so secure!"
Rishi,3,5,Great Antivirus with good Support I am using this antivirus from almost 3 years no complaints
Incredibly disappointed customer,1,1,"Bitdefender charged my card for 8 years running (right before Christmas so the transaction was missed). The email they had has been out of use for 7 years, i never activated any of the codes yet they continued to increase the price and charge me knowing full well i was not aware of this. It is an unacceptable scam with no essence of respect for customers. i have been in touch multiple times for a refund, they keep saying they will get back to me and they do not."
Pieter Tjorrel Delport,2,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for 5 years now and I can only recommend them as the best. My Laptop is protected, my data is protected and my personal info is protected.Bitdefender does not slow down my Laptop as others programs have.I can block trackers on any browser. My banking is safe.I find Bitdefender user friendly. It is the best Internet Protection choice I made."
Tam,1,5,"Bitdefender has a dependable product and support, and I have piece of mind with Bitdefender installed."
Mr john Tanner,45,1,What total rubbish I have 10 devices with them and I had an issue with one its now been 2 days no protection I have had to resort to using a free trial for another company just to get by I was asked to remove the product and reinstall this I did however it would not go back on I contacted them and they said can you give us a screen shot and run error logs Hello how can I run an error log if the product will not load I call in desperation and get we will be back to you in two days 14 e mails or more I have had no reply Totally rubbish all round Good AV until you have a problem then they let you down
Lew F,2,5,I have been a Bitdefender user for a full year. The Anti-Virus software is rated highly within the industry by Industry publications. I find the application easy to work with and have already extended my subscription for an additional two yeas
Ellen,1,5,"I have NEVER had ANY issues with my systems/devices being hacked or infected. I have seen Bitdefender block many attacks on my system in real time.I love the way they have it set up so you can control how things go. All the features and excellent customer support will definitely keep me renewing every year!Their VPN is far superior to others I've tried, actually I have tried 10 security systems on my laptop and other devices and Bitdefender is, as I said, the superior of them all!"
Robert,1,5,Been a user for 9 years. Keeps me safe and sound. Thank you Bitdefender.
Simon Downs,3,1,"ruins what should otherwise have been a good product,. but the real killer is the auto renew and inflated fee!!1) almost impossible to set it up on MAC and multiple devices.2) rubbish auto communication is frustratingly misleading3) did however find out that they set me up for auto-renew for twice what I paid first time!!Unreal. Do not use, if you do register to remove auto renew!! It is more than you paid!!"
H Pino,1,1,"Auto-renewal is theft. Why would you auto-renew and leave an opening to a company that can charge you whatever they want. The seven day notice in a email that you will be renewed, is something you can overlook. Get so many emails they are hard to sort through. Also, what if you are away from a computer during that small window and have no access to your email. Kaspersky provides the same security and for less than what Bitdefender charges on your renewal. Additionally, they have better features. The reason Bitdefender auto-renews, is in hopes that you will not find a better deal and slip in an overcharge. It is like walking into a courtroom and being told you are guilty, because we auto-issue a guilty plea on your behalf. Didn't you get our email? So you buy this product because you want safety from theft of your private information and security from those that would steal from you, and guess what, that very company scams you."
Ian Mann,7,5,"Bitdefender is a powerful security program working unobtrusively, onlyinforming you of problems if they need your input. The help line can sort out any queries you may have."
Mihai C,3,5,
Douglas Richardson,3,5,Used twice to sort out a problem since I been a customer for about 4 years.
Bruce Wright,2,5,"I LOVE BD. EZ Instal, Updates, Pricing, Servicing, and Cus.Serv.The ONLY Disadvantage is My Not So Expert Knowledge, but with BD's excellent Follow-up,,,& ENCOURAGEMENT! I'm a happy camper, CUZ i've had other Inferior, Trouble-Some Software! BEFORE I MET Bitdefender & Fell In Love! ... EZ PZ!  ... that's it!"
J. Grimsley,1,2,"I contacted bitdefender this morning, via their chat option, to ask about the VPN service. I was told to read the faq's and then I could ask questions. I needed to ask questions because I don't normally understand most of the technical documentation and due to some physical limitations. Never got the information that I was looking for and bitdefender hasn't gotten back to me yet. A big let down for this customer which happens to be a paid subscriber and a bitdefender box owner/user. Thanks for not helping me!"
Joseph Saporito,1,5,I like the timely responses to my queries and their quick resolution.
Capt-Marco Hawk,4,5,"Fantastic, if you really care about your files and/or pictures bitdefender has the biggest chance to help you, and the customer care is fast and very professional, I would not go to anyone else or recommended any other program.."
John Baker,8,5,Does what it says on the tin!
Sanjay Bhatia,1,4,"Overall it is a very good software. It works silently in the background. It is not a drain on the computer's memory. Bitdefender wallet is a very useful feature. It protects me when I am browsing online. One suggestion . the product I got is a bitdefender total security however, it doesn't have the ability to clean the hidden cache on my computer or my cell phone. Overall I am satisfied with the software and will recommend it to my friends and family."
Robert Walters,2,5,"My dealings with this provider have been extremely good and given the size of the Company, you are always sure of a quick, respectful and helpful solution to your requests for help.I also have no hesitation in using my mobile on any public Wi-Fi network with Bitdefender using an easily accessed VPN service which can be operated at different levels according to your needs."
Tom,7,5,"Great Product. !I have been a customer or several months now. The service is reliable and has run smoothly. It has transparent diagnostic tools. To the best of my measurements it has been accurate and quick. There was an instance were i contacted support, and they responded in a very helpful manner within a day. I was very pleased with the service.Thank Bitdefender !"
Ivan Debrito,3,5,Excellent protections across most known computer infection threats.
Hans Sassenfeld,1,5,"I had been using Bit Defender Anti Virus for a couple of years and was very satisfied.  I heard about Bit Defender Box and decided to purchase since it included one year anit-virus as well.  I was extremely surprised how well the Box worked with my whole network and how it diagnosed all the connected devices.  Having built one of the original Mits 8080 computers and sold Apple II serial number 98, I am a computer geek from way back.  The bit box took over and provided protection increased protection in areas that I had not imaged were an issue.  My router fried and took out the Bit Box.  The support at Bit Defender was excellent replacing my Bit Box quickly.  I ended up not replacing my wireless router saving hundreds of dollar by using the built in wireless in the Bit Box.  I already had a Gigabit Switch to tie in my wired devices.  In summary: Get high tech state of the art product, excellent support, and easy to use for Geeks (Me) and non-geeks (my friends that have purchased on my recommendation)."
Carol J. Jackson,4,1,"Last year I purchased Bitdefender for my iMac. Over the last 6 months it has been running more slowly with the beach ball. Since Christmas, it has been really bad so I took it into my local Mac store. I picked it up today. In their words, “ removed LOTS of Adware and Malware”. I was shocked and annoyed. They told me they removed Bitdefender and uploaded Malwarebytes.I will not be using Bitdefender any more."
Wayne Spore,1,3,"The first time I called BD about loading my renewal, the person I talked to did get me started on 1 PC. He also said that I had issues, and gave the name of another company to contact to help me with them and with putting BD on my other devices. I checked with the BBB on the net and it was NOT a BBB recommended co. I then called about an issue about my renewal billing that BD brought to my attention. Ben the next BD rep. was very helpful and said I probably did not need the other co. and also solved the renewal issue. I still need to get BD on my other devices."
Bata Peric,2,5,I have been trying out lots of other Security Service providers but since I tried Bitdefender Security Software few years back I have been using them ever since and I could not be happier. Give them a chance you won't be sorry. Regards John
Nathan Kapner,3,5,"I'm glad my system administrator (my son) recommended, helped install and set up Bitdefender. As a retiree, I'm on the computer alot and it's a great feeling to know I don't have to worry about being exposed and taken advantage of while browsing."
Daniel,1,5,"Best total protection, not to slow down the devices."
Splash Down,1,5,I decided to take advantage of the early renewal notification discount on Total Security 2020 and VPN Premium. Unfortunately the renewal website would not allow the discount on the VPN. A phone call to Customer Service was able to correct the problem and make it right. I like the fact that they have a number to call and speak to a live person without having to wait days for results.
Male Grooming Co,2,5,Easy to install and navigate. Customer support is above excellent. You get more than your money's worth. I am an old school business owner with basic (at best) knowledge in today's advanced tech world and Bitdefender is really easy for me to use.It gives me great peace of mind.
Harold Pinkley,7,5,"Bitdefender is GREAT!  I'm a 72 year old Military Veteran with 90% Disability and being treated for Dementia.  Bitdefender keeps me from having to worry about my computer, my Bank Account,  and my Identity.  Customer Support is GREAT and always available to assist."
StupidBulls,3,5,Helped me with my decision making for the correct product for multi-systems that can be kept an eye on all in one place.
Paylos Kwnstantinidhs,2,5,"I am one of those peopl who wouldnt pay for a sub for quite many years and jump from one trial and provider to another, till I bumped into Bitdefender. Used it for 30 days on trial, it was lightweight, always there watching silently and advising me when it was needed without throttling my system or popping up unnecessary stuff on the screen.Provides a ton of stuff and monitors everything that needs to be monitored.Can't recommend it high enough to be completely honest and I rarely take time to review a product!"
Karen Harriman,4,1,I am very upset with this company. It has been 3 weeks since I requested a refund for an unneeded and unwanted program and have still not received it after several inquiries. Maybe cashflow problems going on here?
Rich,1,5,"Effective, reliable, worth the money."
KC,2,1,"Anyone rating this app above a one (1) or two (2), is not to acquainted with other virus protection programs. There support team is absolutely horrible their best response is, “we are experiences unusually high call volume”. I have been waiting four (4), days now to a yes or no answer. My question is simple, “are you controlling my Wi-Fi properties”. My Wi-Fi properties are missing, the window is completely blank. So what l am thinking that they are, and there is no way to return control of my Wi-Fi properties without uninstalling their product. Why not just say this when I click on the properties button: Wi-Fi properties are being controlled by Bit Defender, to disable this etc. Like most programs that are broke, they know most user will just say F*** it, or forget about. I could go on picking the program apart, but this problem is a very simple one why not handle it."
Albert Chehade,2,5,"Bitdefender was first introduced to me a few years back by a friend.At the time I was with another virus protection software provider, but was disillusioned by their apparent lack of customer care.So I switched to Bitdefender, and have not ever looked back since.You want complete, round the clock internet virus protection and total peace of mind?Look no further than Bitdefender..........:)"
Izzy Mesoj,1,1,I'm having the same issue as Steve posted earlier this week. I've been having issues logging into my Defender Central and I can't get anyone to help me. I've had to send several emails and make multiple calls to no avail. I keep getting told I'm being escalated and nothing happens. I need to take my business to a company that responds to their customers.
Stephen,1,1,"Customer service is a problem if you have an issue. I am still waiting on support it's been a week, two calls and 6 emails and I still have no resolution on if I am protected, just we will escalate to a two. Isuue sent 1-19-2020 no resolution and it's 1-27-2020"
Peter Thornber,2,3,My Subscription is due soon and I have been offered a reduced price of £48.99 which is considerably more than the Price of £35 for a new Customer.So Much for Loyalty
Wouter van der Merwe,1,5,Bitdefender is excellent. Their Support Center is top-notch.
JJ Freeman,1,5,"I am deeply impressed by the stellar True Excellence of cyber security knowledge, expertise and performance of Bitdefender. Bitdefender granted me peace of mind and safety in safeguarding and securing my person in the use, procurement and offerings of  Bitdefender products, services and security information. I am an intermediate technology user, working on enhancing and effectively producing my skills and abilities to protect my devices and myself, both personally and professionally. In my ardent haste of resolving the my issues, I found that being quick in my assumptions  led to a stop point where I assumed I had the issue tended to. However, in my haste, I also realize that such a quick cut in communication left me in a stalemate. I turned to Bitdefender to not only admit those failings, but to show me where I went wrong. Bitdefender agent, Razvan  gave me an instant resolution and worked it out for me quickly and perfectly. Thank you for showing me that an older person can still learn and correct new tricks in the 21st century. Well Done, Bitdefender!"
David Brown,1,5,"This is easy to install, it runs on all of my devices for the one fixed subscription and these guys seem to be ahead of emerging threats.  I can also remotely monitor the security status of my families devices which is great because they are not very technical."
David Redfern,3,5,"Excellent and effective protection. I had an issue with buying one of the products and through my own clumsiness, bought 3 products . I contacted Bitdefender and they solved the issue so cannot fault them."
Norman Wheatley,1,5,I bought it on the recommendation of a friend who is up to speed with computers. It was on a special offer and and I considered it good value for money. It seems to work well and is easy to use so I am a happy customer.
Steven Warren,2,1,"Despite repeated requests , Bitdefender have not sorted the problems I have kept encountering. I had used their Total Security package for two years without a problem . Since the automatic renewal in December 2019 , the Anti spyware and anti virus do not update . They are ignoring my emails . An absolutely shocking standard of service . I have asked for a refund so I can purchase my security elsewhere but they do not reply . Avoid at all costs ."
hi,1,4,"After asking, I feel that the installation policy is very loose.However, the home version mentioned in the terms is only used in the home area, and I personally understand that the use range is too small. Whether this clause can be changed is more understandable. If I do n’t ask the service staff, I would not recommend this software to my friends."
Sally Alina Mika,1,1,"I bought Bitdefender for Mac which I purchased on Dec. 20, 2019 for $29.99. I was not satisfied with the software, it did not prevent Bing redirect, so I uninstalled it and requested a refund in writing on 3 occasions: Dec. 30, 2019; Jan. 4, 2020; and Jan 6, 2020. Their ONLY response me was an e-mail then from offering me 3 free months of service. Why would I want 3 months of a product which does not meet my needs?On Jan. 7th I filed a dispute with PayPal and the SAME DAY I received an email from Bitdefender that they could not issue me a refund BECAUSE I filed a dispute. PayPal denied my dispute and now the 30 day ""refund"" period has expired.I feel this company gave me the run around so that the 30 day refund period would lapse. This is POOR BUSINESS.I am writing this in hopes that others do not do business with this company!"
Alan Owens,4,1,"DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY OR TIME.I have an issue with malware on my computer, & I'm getting popups advertising different websites about 30 a day. I contacted Bitdefender via phone after several attempts. Their voicemail says we will call you back in 60 to 90 minutes and I get a call back for 5 hours later. They do not offer remote assistance. So they send me an email on how to get rid of the malware which doesn't identify where the malware exists when I follow their instructions. So they instruct me to make log & take a screenshot of the pop-ups, and email it to them. 3 days later I get a response that they are reviewing the log. 5 days later I get a response if there sending the file to their virus lab. Really? 5 days later they're going to send my file to the virus lab? In a digital age this should have been done on day one. If this is how they service, their customers, I'm definitely NOT going to renew with Bitdefender. I would cancel Bitdefender now however, I have already prepaid for their service.They don't offer remote support, and I have to wait days before getting an answer via email. I am not impressed with their service or customer care. The malware should have been blocked by Bitdefender, & now I am suffering through endless popups. My patience has worn out waiting for them to do their job. From a customer service standpoint, I would not waste your money or time with Bitdefender."
risingmoon,1,2,"An effective product but my experience is overshadowed by its handling of credit card information. I was caught out by not unticking the auto-renewal clause. I received notification less than 24hrs before funds were taken from a dormant credit card account - A rookie mistake that I won't repeat.On airing my concerns, the company closed my antivirus account without warning, leaving my PC unprotected and have issued the refund to a credit card account that has now been closed. I will be following this up but what an unnecessary hassle.I found that Bitdefender slowed my device down a great deal. At the end of the one year contract I was considering alternatives. I accepted however that I had just not been vigilant enough to pick up on the sneaky auto-renewal and resigned myself to another year. Their customer services team informed me in an initial response that the auto-renewal was all above board and that it had been my fault, which I accepted to a small extent. However several emails were subsequently received from them. As I considered the matter settled, I left them unread as I was not interested in any further offers etc. Clearly there has been some sort of understanding but I don't understand why no response from me was a trigger for closing my account at that point. Who knows, but its one of those customer service experience I won't forget. It's a shame because it is not a bad product."
sharon larin,1,5,"I’ve had two other security/virus protectors before Bitdefender, your product far exceeded either one of them and your product was cheaper."
Angel Sevov,2,1,"For both PC and Mac versions: one of the worst support ever. plus their software deletes user files without user confirmation. in my case i submited a copy to them and theyve updated virus signatures. but If you dont have a backup, dont use their software or after installation go immediately to settings and change that behaviour before bitdefender starts to delete your things. their installation media installs everything every modul without any confirmation. for exemple VPN! yes you can uninstall it BUT after a restart it comes back. and their support couldnt fixed either. so ive uninstalled it entirely from my PC. Although my autorenewal is disabled, ive just got a mail and it says that they will renew my subscription for FULL price for whole year.  and they say that i dont have to do anything, sit back and enjoy the ""auto-renewal"" *****. it is amazing how they treat us customers ((i took a screenshot that my Auto-Renewal is disabled and deleted my card from payment method from their portal))"
thomas,4,2,"I use Bitdefender since 2 year. The protection is pretrty good. The problems come with network connections and network speed. It slows down our whole network. Since 1 month we cant even use our IP softphones anymore. Trying to delete BT doesn't work, failure notice. Trying to reinstall doesn't work either. Support has been contacted 4 times. Response time 3 weeks. Ticket response time in between to solve the propblem 7 days. Over all worst support. Still after 7 weeks of support (overall 4 tiomes contact) the problem is not solved and the ydo not reply. We had to reinstall Mac osx and set up the mac completly. extreme waste of time! we will change to another software."
John Doyle,2,5,Simply honestly......... I believe that after more than 5 years using Bitdefender I have to say.........when your on the best program STICK to it.Thank you.
Agajan Nurgeldiyev,1,5,so far very pleased overall as IT head of SME organization.
Florin Gaming,1,5,Best product. Its clean your de axez from viruzes.
George Weldin,4,5,"Friendly,  helpful, knowledgeable. But This survey repeatedly asked for my name,To repeat my comment repeatedly.  Did mind. The question,   but the survey askedRedundantly asked for  stuff I gave them already"
Veikko Pekki,1,5,The best app in many years I have to protect my smart phone. Works smoothly and gives the fast VPN. It's very worth of money.
LaTonya M,2,1,"I contacted the company the day after my auto renewal. Since, I’ve received three emails and no refund from the company. I’ve received one email offering a discounted service and two emails that a response is taking longer than usual. I was denied a refund from Paypal the same day that I was sent a response that I’d be given a temporary credit. How is this company allowed to hold customers hostage?! I no longer have the computer that I used this service on and forgotten I had Bitfender. I will continue to look into a means of recourse. This is unethical. How does a company refuse to refund for a service that they can verify isn’t being used?Update: I heard back after this review and was informed that I would have a refund within 5 to 7 days. That was on January 15th. I am yet to receive the refund and emailed again today! This has to be the most frustrating experience! Why take the time to respond if there’s no follow through! Was I supposed to forget?"
Dave,1,5,"12 months ago I had never heard of Bitdefender, now it protects my entire network!The desktop solutions provide a great method of protecting against the multitude of intrusion methods that currently exist, even providing options such as WiFi advisor (that then invokes the built-in VPN client) through to a monitor to alert when applications try to access you microphone and/or webcam.And if you need support, their 24x7 online support desk provides prompt and honest advice. Where solutions may nto be immediately available, they keep you informed personally with progress so you never feel forgotten.12 months into a new relationship with this company and I have no desire or intention to move away!"
Stuart,1,5,"Over the many years that I have been with Bit Defender they have never failed to successfully service my needs whenever I had a problem. Their phone technical service is top notch. They have always been fair and generous with me. The waits are short and they are courteous, knowledgeable and available. Their product is one of the best. As far as I am concerned they deserve this five star rating."
N Murugesan,3,5,"Bitdefender provides a comprehensive solution to security and privacy while using devices (Computers, cell phones, home network connected devices) on the Internet. I received an one year free subscription to Netgear Armor powered by Bidefender for all my devices when I purchased a Netgear Orbi mesh router for my home. I am very satisfied by the Bitdefender protection to prevent any intrusion in to my home network and devices."
Ruth Franz,2,5,I have had Bitdefender for 5 or 6 years and if I ever have a problem they are willing to keep on until the problem is solved.
Alison,3,5,AntiVirus for Mac works very well and is constantly updated to avert threats.  Very good customer service if you need it.
JLR,1,5,"One forgets Bitdefender is running on the computer. This is a sign of a great product; not reducing the performance of the machine and its doing its work in stealth. Also temptation to look else where is has occurred, great product."
Dan Gribbin,3,5,Bitdefender is easy to set up and responsive to questions and changes in equipment.  We've been fully protected for several years and have been very pleased with customer service.  Highly recommended!
David Liu,1,5,"A good app with VPN function, also a good service team of high responsiveness."
Keith Thomas,8,1,See review 3 days ago. Message from Bitdefender asking for order details! Had already provided these back on Dec 10 through Trustpilot in addition to multiple emails direct to Bitdefender support. Sent a very curt critical email reply through Trustpilot and FINALLY I get a proper response no the “ we will respond as soon as possible....” standard reply. Money has now been refunded - but I am sure this has only happened because of repeat critical reviews on Trustpilot. Bitdefender need to improve their customer support big time! because actually the product seems good. Will I renew? - watch this space as I have cancelled the auto renew - but it seems other reviewers on here have also cancelled auto renew but have had the money taken! Which is a nightmare if my experience of getting a refund for a genuine mistake is anything to go by. My advice would be to cancel the card you used a couple of weeks before renewal - that way you have complete control. BUT you shouldn’t have to resort to these tactics.
Ruthies_kid,1,5,I really like this antivirus.  It has a clean interface and it does not disrupt my other programs.  I had a problem and it was helped quickly by Mihai.
Al Budd,1,5,Very happy with response time when I had a minor issue. Problem quickly corrected.
viki qetesia,1,5,"Thanks for your answers - I'm happy to use Bitdefender! efficiency, security, documentation storage, easy-to-use service.use and touch my thinking in reality.all the best to all Bitdefender staff."
Earl Lawson,1,4,it would be very helpful for us older folks if bitdefender and lots of other websites would simplify their websites. Lots of times when I click on a website it does not go to that site directly
Paul W. Thompson,1,5,Awesome best service in a long time!!
Martin Hickman,48,1,Took my money after weeks of harassing emails and then the services doesn’t even work.
Roger Barzelay,3,5,"I have had Bitdefender on my MacBook Pro for a year, and it has been FLAWLESS. Great protection at a very reasonable price. I could not be happier with this antivirus software and highly recommend it to anyone."
Shelby Snoofeler,1,5,"Anyone who has a Smartphone should try Bitdefender Mobile Security with excellent real time online protection. A great value. I always wait for a sale as I am retired on a fixed income and so 5 devices for less than $35.00 per year is a tiny cost compared to becoming infected, losing your data or having identity stolen. Also the ability to wipe your phone should it be stolen, snap a photo of some person t trying to find out your pin and locating the device is reassuring. Plus you can protect your apps from unauthorized access by other apps. It's a very creepy cyber environment and knowing you are as protected as you can be is reassuring. A lot depends on yourself becoming savvy but if you have kids using a Smartphone I can't imagine not giving them good protection as well."
Jaison Palocaren,1,5,Have been using Bitdefender for two years and am completely satisfied with the protection of all my devices on both android and IOS platforms. Customer service is excellent and above all product renewals are priced very competitively.
Robert Miles,1,5,"There are so many companies and so many products on the Market, it is difficult to KNOW just where to invest your money as you seek the elusive ""Service after you BUY.""Speaking only for myself, and NOT improperly biased, I can say in all honestly that I was both surprised and pleased with the manner in which I was treated by the Bitdefender folks after I encountered a problem with a Bitdefender product.The suprise was...the Bitdefender Service folks KNEW what to do, were patient with ME, and stayed with me until my problem was resolved. My reaction is just this; you can TRUST the people at Bitdefender!Robert Miles."
Richard Bulman,1,5,"I have used this software for many years on 2 PC's, 2 Android's and an Ipad with NO issues.Their support has been outstanding."
Mike Oberacker,1,2,"Well it did not protect one laptop, been out of service for 4 days. Customer service sucks, no rush on their part, seems they don't understand taking care of a customer quickly and getting things resolved. More than 24 hours no results and don't know when results will come."
Lee,7,2,"Hiunfortunately  you stated a renew price of 69 pound when I first took it out it was £27 how do you state a renew price and rip me off, charging me double the price.Commen sense to keep my custom would be to charge me the same or little less.To me you are ripping me off and making excuss for poor customer service.Regards a customer who wont be returning    From: Bitdefender Support Center Hi Lee,Thank you for contacting us.The offer you received was part of a different sale, our prices are always changing and that's why you received a different price.Here you have an offer for a Total Security subscription for 5 devices :Lee, if you have further questions feel free to contact us anytime, we are available 24/7.Have a wonderful day!Best regards,Stavar PetruCommercial Support RepresentativeI have just checked the e-mail you have sent me on an auto-renewal option I cant believe how much you want to charge me for another year and to have an auto-renewal is disgusting.To top that off you offer me then at £49 from £69 ,yet I can buy for £27.99.Can you tell me why you think that this acceptable to charge  me so much money and so many various prices, and why you are ripping me off.RegardsLee"
Phillip Dove,6,4,"A great product, but feel a bit let down by service. Renewed subscription and have not had new activation. Three emails have brought no response.An update: I’ve now had the situation resolved. A bit disappointing that it took a week but now happy again. Upgraded rating to 4 as a result."
Albert,2,5,"Excellent Antivirus,good customer service, overall it defines itself as the No:1 Antivirus/Security Solution."

Dave Vancura,1,5,Your the best even better than Kaspersky
Ron S-M,23,5,Used BD for a few years now and have always found the Support Team to be friendly efficient and professional in their communication in resolving various issue's that have arisen over the years. The AV programme itself appears to work well and is easy to use.Ron.
Ákos Ertner,1,5,I'll be very short. I've been using Bitdefender Total Security for two years now and haven't had any problems.
bbboake,1,2,"This year I went in and selected not to automatically renew. They automatically renewed it anyway and now they keep sending me emails to renew. This is a totally inept company.Bitdefender did respond to my concerns in a timely fashion so I have changed my score to 4 stars. This was never about the application which is a good tool, it was all about the renewal process.So the saga continues, received an email indicating that my subscription would not be renewed however it was renewed even though in the tool I indicated I did not want a automatic renewal."
Ruth Hopkins,6,1,"Bitdefender has kept telling me that all is ok with my computer, despite my email being hacked on several occasions. I have asked them for help each time and asked why they have not detected the issues-without success.I have uninstalled their software early and installed Total AV who have detected and removed the problem straight away.Shame on Bitdefender"
Fran Teacher,1,5,"Very easy to communicate with Bitdefender, great feedback and immediate replies and help, great at helping me with any questions or issues I had!  WONDERFUL experience!  Worth every penny, and then some!  Thanks so much!"
Robert C,34,3,"BitDefender is sluggish, nagging, and complicated. It advertised an interactive firewall but it never worked, even going through customer support never got it fixed. I wouldn't really be tempted to try another free trial."
Jeffrey Wright,1,1,"This is the worst software cancer.  Once installed, you can never get it out of your computer.  Application removers can't get it our of your computer.  Technicians cannot get it out of your computer.  This is the worst cancer of software."
Robert Seton,2,5,Bitdefender is an amazing product with excellent customer service/technical services. I highly recommend Bitdefender for all your computer security needs.
Nahum,1,5,"As first time user with Bitdefender, I am absolutely satisfied with the following reasons: 1. Price range for the product is great, very affordable for everyone.2. Selection of products are amazing. You can choose a product that suits your needs.3. Covers almost all devices: Microsoft PCs, Android, iOS Apple (both Mac and iPhone devices)4. Free 200MB daily VPN5. 5 or 10 devices coverage option.These are all great features!!"
F W Warrington,20,5,A product that can be trust with lots of facilities and an excellent Customer Service
brian erhardt,1,1,"Bit defender has gone another year without improving software. This is not a good security software. Have had to remove software as no support is present. Clearly who ever is in charge is not doing there job. Do not like to write off  packages which I have paid for, but this program was not ready for consumers a year ago, and from all appearances has gone without improving. The TOTAL lack of support clinched the choice to look elsewhere. Do NOT use this software anyone with a half of a brain will avoid BITDEFENDER. In their defense help has contacted me multiple times, once to render activation code useless"
Bill,1,5,Bitdefender is easy to load and easy to use at a very reasonable or even cheap price. I have been using it for a few years and have only had one problem with a renewal because for some reason the activation code wasn't sent. A quick online chat fixed the problem. M
Nick,3,1,"I purchased a Bitdefender Anti-Virus license in 2019, and they automatically charged me again in 2020 when I did not want to continue my license. I got in touch with their customer services on the same day and they still did not cancel or refund the charges to my account. I've never had such a hard time trying to get a refund back. Poor experience overall with Bitdefender."
Bogdan Andrei,1,5,Very happy with Bitdefender and it's security against viruses also the support team was very helpfull
branko lozuk,1,5,"This is very easy. I am very satisfied using this produc, because it  keep me safe for the long time."

Sebastian Davicco,1,5,
Michael Westling,1,5,BEST virus protection available -- HANDS DOWN !!
Muhammed Eren,7,1,"I suggest you stay away from this company.although I did not want to renew, they did. They don't refund. They have saved my debit card information and do not delete it. they do not respond to any mail I have sent to cancel. I can not communicate. they don't even deserve a bad score. their score is zero."
Chapin,1,1,"I cancelled the Bitdefender Internet Security 2020 subscription the same day they charged my credit card on 12/8/19 and requested a refund for this unwanted and unused subscription. 10 days, 2 chats & 2 emails later I still have not been refunded. Instead I received an email trying to discount the price, extend the subscription and do a partial refund. I have never had such a hard time trying to get refund. I cannot recommend their customer service."
Paraphil,1,5,"I've used Bitdefender for many years. It's easy to implement and upgrade, the support is excellent and the protection coverage is comprehensive. You can, in the main, install and forget about it."
Denise Andrews,1,1,"After reading great reviews, I wanted to purchase the product, but had no antivirus protection on my computer. I called the number listed on the website to pay by phone and was told I needed to pay on line. I explained my reluctance to use a credit card on my computer, since I had zero protection, but the gentleman insisted  that I go back to the website and pay. I chose another company & am so glad I did. Norton was happy to take my payment over the phone and walk me thru the process. Bitdefender's bad customer  service was my gain."
Debra Williams,1,1,"I bought the program from Best Buy for $49.99. I was suppose to have VPN, malware removal, and a host of other security features. The VPN is for 200mb, meaning privacy browsing is set for 200 mb of data every 24 hours. I had not used my computer, maybe the usage could have come from my phone; however, when I picked up my  computer the 200 mb VPN was all used up. The program continually asks me to upgrade to premium VPN for another $49.99. I really don't know if my computer is safe at all. I have since added a free antivirus and VPN."
Deborah Benson,1,1,"I tried to install Bitdefender on my computer. I had difficultly doing so, so I reached out for help. Someone called me from there and took over my husbands computer. As of right now the computer is not working at all. We are also out of $124.17 dollars. I will never contact these people again."
Kyle Wen,1,5,"BitDefender is effective at guarding my PC against the threats of viruses with an affordable price, and the Customer Care department quickly responded to my product activation problem and solved it with only 1 reply."
Paul MacDonald,1,5,"It is lightweight, and does what it is supposed to. I have never had an infection, though there was some that were blocked. I have used the paid version for a few years and the free version before that with out any issues at all. Highly recommended."
Boomer,1,5,BitDefender search team continue to resolve security breaches where other competitor fall short.
Roger Carr,4,5,"Can be relied upon to check your system on a regular basis and stop any unwanted interference from outsiders without slowing your PC down. Overall, a good product."
Teresa M. DeChant,1,5,I just purchased bit defender and accidentally bought two subscriptions of software. Customer support activated a rebate to me immediately. The Customer Support was excellent additionally in assisting me to easily set up bitdefender on my Mac and iPhone!
Brook Acklom,2,5,"Excellent product, great value, outstanding customer service. Have tried all major anti-virus products and decided Bitdefender is far superior to others."
Graham,8,2,"Might be good at protecting a computer but what gives with the nag screen every time I start the laptop......CD/DVD requires a scan. So it's got a CD in the drive, it's been there quite some time. It's also been scanned once....I had hoped the nag screen would go away. No chance. And there doesn't seem to be a way to get shot of it either. I've disabled this and that but it still shows at every boot. I'm not a fan of nag screens. I like programs that just do the biz. I doubt if I shall be renewing, indeed I might got shot of it sooner than I expected."
Jesus Torres,4,1,"Tried reporting a problem they have while uninstalling their VPN service, always gave an error while uninstalling and would reinstall after a computer restart on its own, and instead got a reply threatening the post with their Forum rules, LOL and answered by post by totally ignoring what the post was about, answering for a solution for things that where not even asked. Told them to please re-read the initial post for what was being reported as a problem and was told they already answered the question when they didn't even address the issues at all. Responded rudely, told me the post was hidden. I told them they don't realize they are not the only company around and they have a lot of competition, so just ended up uninstalling their software and they won't see me again. Their software always has problems, always. They may have some great scores with AV tests and all, but their software is sometimes even worse than malware, notice I say sometimes. It can be a good software but many issues, just see their forum, sometimes they cause problems with CPU usage, RAM usage, and anything in between."
Fadi Sarsak,1,5,"The best security which doesn't bottleneck your machines, it does the opposite by cleaning it and speeding it up. I'm a 10 years + customer and never got disappointed."

Razvan Carp,3,5,"Excellent products, great customer service, the best overall experience I've had using a security suite."
Peter Tomov,4,5,"I am using Bitdefender for a few years. One year I decided to try Kaspersky, which is not a bad program, but not as good as Bitdefender. I think that Bitdefender is a fantastic product. The team behind is working 24/7 to find a solutions for the constantly changing internet environment. This efforts bring to the market product, which serves more than 500 million customers in the world. I think I will stick to Bitdefender to the foreseen future because it brings peace of mind."
Nicholas,2,5,"It works and, as with all software, when there are the occasional problems the technical support is very good."
Fred,1,5,"Customer since 2015. Bitdefender is great. Cruising net is a breeze, service is excellent, support as well.Thx"
Hadi Ali,5,5,Bitdefender is the one of the best total security for your devices .It will scan and keep your virus database updated with less user interference and also keep your PC and other devices at optimal level.It has one of the best anti tracking and ad-wares blocker . so you dont have to worry about any websites tracking you or ads that keeps you annoying .Most companies are worried about latest threats about ransomware but now you have Bitdefender that has multi layer protection.You can scan the device from the bitdefender app .Since 2 years i have not being infected with any virus or malwares.I just have one minor concern is a support is a bit slow but its okay as long as the issues is resolved. apart from that these guys are awesome .Happy being Bitdefender Customer.

christian,45,5,"This protection software is the best I have ever tried, and that covers most of the other big brands over the years. Runs super smooth on every pc and super easy to install.Then the fact its constantly winning the tests makes it even more nice."
Mr M Miller,2,5,Best I have used. I used to use the free version but am now totally committed to the paid for version as it has a lot more to offer.And the customer care response was great when I had an issue.I can only recommend this product.
Joan Chambers,1,5,"Have been using the 5 Device Family Pack for 3 years now.  The product works across 2 iPhones, 2 PC’s and 1 tablet seamlessly."
Tony Osborne,2,5,
Goangora,1,5,Bitdefender is a great product. Customer care is outstanding!! I recently went to my phone company's website and they were trying to sell me internet security. They said they had tested my Bitdefender security and it had failed the phishing part. So I asked Bitdefender about it and they did some research and said some companies will do that so you will buy their product. I am very happy with Bitdefender as I have had no breaches of my security and that is why I keep going back to them. They also are reasonably priced.
Darren Lewis,1,5,"I've been a loyal Bitdefender customer for over 3 years now. Every time there has been a security threat encountered, the software has been successful in blocking it. At the right time, you can buy it at a cheap price and the customer service is excellent. Would also highly recommend Bitdefender to anyone wanting to protect against phishing/malware and don't want a complex interface."
Marian Keady,2,5,"Bitdefender is reasonably-priced, user-friendly for a non-techie like myself and has never ever let anything such as malware, phishing, Trojan horses and the like enter my computer. Deservedly, they have won many awards. It is my experience that Customer Care are quick to respond and are helpful.  A refreshing change as I find many companies dishonest and below par in terms of their products, pricing and customer service."
Mark,1,5,This is a Security application that will give your mobile phone 100% protection from malware and viruses and there costumer care is world class.
Alan Sizemore,1,5,Excellent product with excellent support.

Bob,1,5,"i was going to take my computer to a repair shop at a price of 80 dollars  to diagnose then more if work was needed .but then i thought to call bitdefender to see if they could help ,my bitdefender support member Andrei Duduc listened to my problem and then guided me through the steps i needed to take to resolve my problem .my computer now works as good as new .Thanks for saving me time and money Andrei . Best regards Bob"
JW1,3,5,"I have used Bitdfender for a few months. Excellent product, works in the background, good customer support if required. Would recommend Bitdfender."
Bob Mathewson,11,1,"I would like my money refunded after spending ages with two chats re a problem I was told by the first one that the activation code had been used which it was but I wanted to add another device after carrying out the instruction as I had done previously I was asked for an activation code again, explained all this again to no avail I was then told to close the page down which I did and lo and behold the chat disappeared , tried a second time and explained everything again and was told again to close the page I was on and you guessed it the chat was closed again seems when they dont have an answer they pull the plug. then I get an email saying that they didnt close the chat trying to blame me diabolical couldnt care less if you get what you paid for , made request for refund and was emailed another pile of useless instructions and links rather than resolve my issue, should I trust them with my security NO. UPDATE received refund followed  with an email to download the software welcoming me to Bitfinder beggars belief really. NO Thanks"
Harry Krabbe,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for awhile now and am very impressed with how well it integrates with my Windows 10 environment. I also have it installed on three more of my devices/desktops. Runs in the background and has lots of tools to keep track of my system security. Thanks Bitdefender :)Update: I have noticed that some Bitdefender users have experienced problems with their auto-renewal subscription. To protect myself in the future, I have cancelled auto-renewal, but still remain a satisfied customer."
Denis Czeskleba,4,2,"Stop promotional pop ups. This is not some freeware. Makes you look increadibly cheap and might be a very real reason to stop buying the product. I dont care that it can be switched off. It should not be enabled by default for a full price product.Edit after the answer: The reason to push ads on customers is obvious. But for anything other than software you have to agree to it. Imagine your phone/TV constantly sending you texts telling you how great Samsung is. Its spam, clear and simple. And it is aggravating. You are not supposed to be some freeware. Your constant spam via email, popups and stuff is getting to the point that I will chose an inferior antivirus program just to get rid of the obnoxiousness after this period. And the answer here just confirms this. Stop selling me stuff I already bought."
JK,13,3,"Terrible UI and documentation.If you want to install on a machine owned by someone else, this is not possible unless you give them your username and password.  Crazy!Stick with Norton, at least the documentation is up to date and it's easy to install.==================Updated 3/12/19 I believe the UI is poor in places but I have updated my star rating from 1 to 3 after working it out.I could, after all, achieve what I wanted but did require some tech support.  A good interface would have negated this and I would otherwise now score it 4.5."
Will Webber,1,5,This important product serves ALL security needs.  Tech support is amazing.  Install is quick and simple.  Google rates this product highly and my personal experience was exactly what I hoped it would be.
Jick Lee,1,5,"I purchased the wrong Bitdefender product, but the customer support helped me to upgrade my purchase without any additional charge. Pretty awesome!"
Karol,1,5,"its working,it will not slow down your computer,comes with other programs that can keep your pc working smoothly.and safely on the net.Tech support is great,and English speaking."
Konstantīns Savirins,1,1,"Bought bitdefender last year. It kept interfering with legitimate software so i uninstalled it. After a year it renewed my subscription automatically for tipple the price (70 euro). Asked for refund, but they offered to pay even more money for extended license. Bad software, bad company."
Elina,1,1,"Can't recommend to anyone! I don't know if their product is any good, cause I was unable to activate my product after purchasing and also unable to remove the auto-renewal. Ended up paying twice for a product that I never used and never installed. No refunds, no service, even though they could see from their system I had never downloaded and had opened several help tickets to sort out the situation. My advice: stay away from this mess."
Raymond Day,2,5,
Mr Andrew Alan Cameron,8,5,"Efficient, no fuss and no deluge of silly sales promotions."
Marcus Adams,1,5,"Bitdefender is an excellent security suite for Mac. Yes, Macs need it.The customer service is spectacularly good. I had issues with getting it up and running on a new Mac because the transfer assistant software on the Mac had corrupted something or broken something and none of the standard DIY recommendations worked.Bitdefender CS arranged a remote session with me on the other side of the world from them (literally) and in 25 minutes had everything fixed and working again. That is Apple-level customer service and I highly recommend them."
Cristian Lupu,1,5,Easy to use and offer a lot of tools in one integrated solution.
Emad Mohamed,3,5,"Great Protection, excellent customer service, affordable price.I have used Bitdefender for 2 years now after trying Norton for one year.I can say that it's the best Web protection, device protection that I had. You can get also, optimiser for your laptop, file shredder, Adblocker, 200 MB daily for VPN."
Mike A,3,5,"No issues of any kind with the protection. The user Dashboard allows for a lot of custimization, and allowed me to turn off some notifications I didn't want popping up because they were so minor in nature. Purchased for 3 machines for multiple years for a great price, and after using the tech support to resolve a minor account issue I'm glad to say that their customer service is also first rate."
Kathy Kittle,5,5,I have contacted Bitdefender on several occasions for help beyond the protection I paid for and they made me feel appreciated. They never responded like I was asking too much of them. They were in constant contact with me with updates on the progress. I have never felt more valued as a customer as I feel with Bitdefender.
Customer,6,5,"Great product, reliable and with plenty of other functions besides the usual antivirus and firewall solutions. It simply never lets you down!"
Pete,33,5,"This is a classy bit of software. Total protection for my Mac from all the dodgy b&^%$@ds out there who are trying to get into your computer!!!!! Their customer service is second to none as I found out in them helping me 'step by step' after Safari wouldn't load an update. Totally recommend Bitdefender! Thank you, it's good knowing they have my back!"
Peter,12,5,Had this package a good few years in preference to Avast who were too aggressive in marketing. Bitdefender works well across our PCs and is well maintained. Some useful features inc. safe banking and VPN.
Tom,1,5,Been a customer for 3-4 years and just today renewed my subscription for another year for 5 devices which I plan on using soon.Keep up the great work BITDEFENDER
Anita Searle,37,5,"Very happy with the Bitdefender security package. I recently had a query regarding renewal dates and this was handled quickly and correctly in a friendly and polite way.Unlike some security services, it does not slow down my system at all. Brilliant package for the family."
Aaron,1,5,Bitdefender protects my computer well from viruses and other phishing programs.
Bob Segal,2,5,"If it really was Bitdefender that solved the problem, then they did a great job. The problem is fixed, but I can't tell who fixed it nor how"
User,1,5,"Bitdefender is in my opinion the best software to keep your Data safe from malware, spyware etc.The design and the systems behind the software are running complete uncomplicated. If there are any problems, you can count to the politely customer support.For me, I would always choose this product, if they keep their service and products on the same level, as it is right know."
Skip,1,5,"I had a problem with another provider and not being satisfied with the actions taken by them, a very well known product by the way, I researched the others and decided to try Bitdefender, I am very happy with my choice, would make the same decision again, and would recommend their product, service and problem solving without hesitation."
Peter M,9,4,Nice software but getting bloated. Still one of the tops one out there though.
Peter,3,5,I have found Bitdefender easy to use and am confident that it gives good protection. The backup support is excellent.
Lori Antoine,2,5,They helped me patiently fix my problem very nice it will get fixed cause they won t let go until its all running good they take their time to explain i have heard that this is one of the best protection i m glad i chose this i don t have to worry about getting frauded or anything like that awesome
John Wilson,1,4,Bitdefender provided a tech to use remote access to handle installation difficulties when virus was blocking installation.
Chris,16,1,"Software is truly just awful; even disabling all firewall access; it is still managing to prevent and report on it blocking access.  Enable exceptions doesn’t work.  I mean for home automation - I would avoid.  I’ve changed to this, and there is no way I would renew it.  Absolutely awful. But defender total security 2019 Nothing about it - can I honestly say is well designed.  Loads of features and just seems to be full of bugs.  Control feels dumb; I suppose it may be ok if you’ve no clue on IT.  But if you port forward or use JSON, web services or run a server  - I would avoid.  I asked for my money back as I didn’t install my 5 devices and only used 1 - they were absolutely unprepared to compromise or refund.  Avoid is my advice.  It is also fairly heavy on resources, a lot more than last years kerspersky.  It has such limited configuration; and support tell you how to do something; it still does not work because it’s buggy.  So you turn all services off and it still prevents access and even notifies you!  I would waste my breathe with their support; the developers need training on quality standards and customer/user satisfaction."
Asif,2,5,"Excellent product, service with support."
Henry,1,4,"Bitdefender Customer support service helpline phone number +1 855 369 8565I recently tried several different Anti-Virus software programs. Only Bitdefender was able to do what I wanted at a price that was very reasonable. Also, I had a problem that I couldn't figure out and their tech support was excellent. It was fixed on the first try!I tried several companies and came right back to Bitdefender. Good going everyone."

James,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender products since June of 2008. I absolutely will never use any other AV or Total Security product for my windows-based machines again. For my main machine, I run Linux, so there's not much of a need for an AV product, but when I do have to use Windows, there is just nothing better than Bitdefender to protect every single aspect of my online environment. As the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for"". Well with Bitdefender, you get much more, because it is not as intrusive as the others, and it doesn't suck up system resources. Pay for a license and sit back worry-free and just enjoy your system."
Rach,1,5,"As the target of a phishing attack, that has included social engineering, phishing phone calls and remote access trojans, Bitdefender has been the frontline defense for my systems. This issue is timely and costly. My experience with Bitdefender has been low cost, and lite on my system resources but priceless in giving me peace of mind."
ANUMON M SASEENDRAN,8,4,"Its a very nice and trustworthy antivirus ,trust me i used many but bitdefender is  number one ,I give fourstars because online payment(subscription renewal was bit complicated for me)"
Blaze,3,5,
Ron,1,5,"Consistent good ""fixes"" when I've had problems. Customer Service has been very good although responses were not always as quick as I would have preferred BUT better than other companies I've dealt with. My issues were pre-existing when I switched to Bitdefender and my motivation to make the change was because it was so difficult communicating with prior vendors. Bitdefender seemed to know how to get to the heart of the problems and make good recommendations for fixing them. All in all I am very happy with my choice to go with them."
Michael Wilcox,11,5,"I've only had this anti virus software for a short time, but so far I consider it to be looking like the best I've had in 25 years.  It's very thorough and unobtrusive and you almost forget it's there until a banner pops up to tell you it's updated your software.  I put in many hours of research on all the anti virus programmes out there and it came down to two but Bitdefender won it.  I had to contact the support staff to help me get rid of the last anti virus software which wasn't easy to get rid of.  The chatline assistant I got was terrific, he really knew his stuff and gave very clear instructions on how to remove the old software.  He was patient and pleasant to deal with.  Bitdefender stands out as the best anti virus software out there and I got it at a really good price from 2GOSoftware UK"

Dr. Tony Tannous.,1,5,A great and low impact Family Package 2020 and excellent customer support whenever needed.
K.Taylor.,4,5,The people staffing Bitdefender are both helpful and knowledgeable. They also have an excellent command of English.

narasimhan rangarajan,1,5,Really happy with the protection combined with cost effective packages and extremely satisfying customer care .
Philip Abberley,6,5,"Bitdefender handled a problem i encountered on my laptop with ease, explained the reason i had the problem and gave me the information i needed to rectify the issue"
Marion Brook,2,3,"Sadly I don't have the positive experience of other reviewers - my review is specifically on Bitdefender Total Security.I purchased Bitdefender Total Security on the 23rd September, I already had the basic anti virus protection on my Mac which I have been very happy with and upgraded to enable usage of the VPN on our other devices. We have 5 devices in total, all our devices are Apple (1 Mac, 2 iPad & 2 iphone) Since purchase we have had the following issuesOn my husbands ipad I downloaded the App and successfully installed the VPN (using the link sent to me via email) but unfortunately whenever he tries to connect he gets error 304 and so therefore it is not usable.On my iPad I downloaded the App but the activation code does not work and therefore it is unusable And no VPN. I decided not to even try on our iPhones as it’s just too much hassle!All the suggestions made by CS I have already tried even uninstalling and re-installing the App, I have a technical background, I know what I’m doing, it shouldn’t be this difficult to install and use! it is truly appalling that I have spent so much time to get it to work, Bitdefender need to address this very poor user experience. Unfortunately for me I only looked at some of the shocking reviews on line once I’d already paid. As I mentioned earlier I was very happy with the anti virus on my Mac and expected a similar good experience; sadly not"
And Go,1,5,"All in one inclusive software. Have been with the rest, now try the BEST!"
Pat/Idaho,9,5,
Nelson Franks,1,2,"While the product is adequate, their customer service is abysmal. I submitted a ticket and heard nothing back for a week. That in itself was mildly irritating, but what turned my ticked-off dial to eleven was what happened afterwards. By the time they bothered to grace me with a response, I had left the country for a month. I replied to their message informing them that I would be in contact upon my return. But apparently BitDefender doesn't bother to actually read emails sent to them. A short time afterwards I received an email saying that they needed more information (though they didn't bother providing any clue what that information might be). I replied again and again informed them I was out of the country. Shortly thereafter I received yet another email requesting the same obscure information. Fed up, I replied that I was disgusted with their service and would be terminating my account once back in the country. This drew a different response. An apology. So I actually had some vague hope that some poor schmuck was reading emails. But that hope was dashed when I received yet another request for the same undefined information. Obviously, their response center is automated. Their customer service is a pathetic joke. My last email was pretty nasty. Why bother even pretending to be civil when you know that you're corresponding with an algorithm. Upon my return, one of the first things I will do is call their support center in hopes of contacting a human being. Though I will be nice to that individual, I will let them know how frustrated I am with their service and that I will be immediately cancelling my account. There are plenty of competent competitors out there."
Rossana Diaz-LeStrange,2,5,Love it! Best antivirus around!
Ramona Palmer,1,1,"Customer service the WORST!!!  They deducted money from my bank account, and I never clicked on the autopay.  They promised to return my money and have not!!!  Instead they tried to offer me a discount, and I told them no, I no longer used Bitdefender. The rep I spoke with on the phone stated they would expedite the return of my funds.  I still have not received the funds, and was furious that they then sent me a thank you for subscribing to Bitdefender.  SCREENSHOT if you sign up with them, and never, never, never click on the autopay. I am still waiting for my refund, and they are not responding to me emails.  Be very careful.  There are other programs out there that provide excellent customer service.  In my opinion...stay away from Bitdefender."
Don Waterhouse,1,5,"Quite new to some of the technical language, concepts, and what it is that Bitdefender is offering.  The agents were friendly, patient, and took time to respond to my questions.  Tech support people who said they would get back to me actually did. The program works great so I have no problems in recommending Bitdefender a great product with excellent tech support."
Nicoleta Vanghele,2,5,"Great application, very good and friendly support team."
Asif Ali,1,5,"We all know how great Bitdefender is... but do you know what's even greater? Their customer service. They are:- Quick to connect to...- Know their stuff...- Friendly, unlike most robots these days behind machines... lol- Connect with them on social media platforms, and they will treat you like a family. I was given a shiny 3D award for being the best follower on Twitter. 😁"
Ian Perrett,1,5,Product is excellent and support is really efficient.
Nathan Panks,1,5,Bitdefender is great its saved me from the hassle just login to bitdefender central on your phone and on the divices tab you cas check all the divices you downloaded
Nick R,13,1,"Great while it worked, but Bitdefender eventually slowed both my Windows and MacOS machine to a crawl after upgrading to Catalina.Removing it from Windows was a complex task, but eventually I managed to get rid of the tool.Removing it from Catalina was an absolute headache. The built-in uninstaller crashed, so I had to hard reboot, and then log into recovery mode to delete the files one-by-one.Bitdefender does not come recommended and I've switched back to using AVG which I left behind and regret doing so."
Jeanne Evans,1,5,"Excellent service,  professional looking  dashboard, inclusive menu, knowledgeable staff,  what more could we hope for? I've felt very protected with my subscription of Bitdefender  for 3+ years across my electronic's board! Thanks, Bitdefender!!!"
Kevin Harney,2,5,"I started with the computer version of Bitdefender initially, 2004. I had Norton’s and acquired virus’s that Bitdefender found and cleaned. I now have Bitdefender Box 2, I have several network devices. My Box has stopped several attempted attacks to my devices, including security cameras. Box is something cannot be without after years of experience. Support and help by Bitdefender  is awesome!!!"
Craig van Beek,1,5,"We've got the 2020 family subscription and it suits our needs perfectly with protection for multiple devices (up to 15), as well as the all important child protection and monitoring device usage. Great value for money"
Storm,1,1,"Awful program, do not install this program. Its a virus in itself, if you try uninstall this program it will not let you. It also blocks programs which are verified by Norton????? NEVER AGAIN"
Justin Felt,1,1,"Have sent multiple emails, multiple customer service tickets. Programs are being deleted off my pc. THIS SOFTWARE IS A SCAM!!! STAY AWAY FROM THEM OR ELSE!!! OTHER REVIEWS MUST BE FAKE PEOPLE!!!"
Bernard,1,5,"Solid, reliable peace of mind that my online experience is safe and protected."
Lorenzo,1,5,I have been using this product since 2009... when i first started with computers...and it has saved me from a lot of problems a few times in the beginning. this is top notch company and i highly recommend then to anyone with a computer.
ZappyyZ,2,5,i put my email in to receive my code but it never came so i emailed customer support who responded the next day ended up i put the email in wrong and it was sorted within a few days the way they handled the situation was perfect and i couldn't be happier and of course the product is excellent i have used it before and ahd no problems at all i have tried other antivirus but none are as good as BitDefender i would 100% say recommend the purchase
Lorraine Harvey,2,1,"No service after buying product. Would not download because it said email and key already used. Contacted them twice, they sent numbers twice that I would be attended to. I went to PayPal asking for a refund. Then I was asked to cancel because long wait of 120 days and might not get refund. Not happy, in fact disgusted, money gone and been waiting five days. Lorraine"
Dave Brocklebank,14,1,"Been using BitDefender Total Security for over 8 years.  I recently installed it on a new desktop, and it deleted my Outlook Ost file and also thousands of system files. 5 days before I received a response from their Support, and I had reset and reinstalled all programs by then.  They still have not answered me about how to prevent BitDefender deleting my Outlook mail or system files if I install it again.  I asked how to set BitDefender to ask me before deleting or quarantining system files... no answer from them.  This product is too powerful... and does not check with the user before deleting/quarantine files.  It wiped my 16 years history of emails.  I had to restore to a backup.  I am still waiting for their reply as I had bought a 5 year license."
Gabriel Marquis,1,5,
Mohammad Aallauddin,1,5,SAFEPAY ACCESSHad issue with Safepay system which has been solved by remote access in person. Excellent job done easily and in time by Bitdefender.
Gary O'Keefe,6,1,"BitDefender double-charged my for my subscription renewal. When I found out and asked for a refund on one of the charges, they told me their policy prevented them from doing so as I hadn't noticed fast enough.They're supposed to be the ones I pay to protect me from crooks."
L Barrell,7,4,I love the product but the customer support is none existant. I have had two tickets open now for nearly a week and still nothing from them! Shame as I would have rated them a lot higher!-----------------UPDATE------------------------------Customer support contacted me and all is resolved now. They did explain that they are receiving a high amount of calls presently and that was the reason for the delay.
Rodrigo Ambiel Fontana,1,5,"Doesn't cost to my computers processing and still manages to be secure when needed and ""permissive"" when I want. Such a great AV"
Matt B,3,3,"Software and services of of great quality with a good level of control and customisation of protection across multiple devices. However, despite any claims of appreciation for loyal customers, do not allow automatic renewal of your subscription: you will inevitably be paying at least 35% more than if you manually opt for a new subscription.Further to this, near expiration of your subscription you will receive emails via 2Checkout. The frequency of these reminders is near-enough spam and the hyperlink to unsubscribe returns you to the main website. Further investigation necessary - unsubscription from these reminders is not appropriately accessible."
Carollyne,1,5,"Professional, reliable and the best support staff out there. I tried Malware but no support. I think an excellent product and live support is the premium combination out there. Support was actually thanking me... I just love a great tech product and I deal in very expensive and technical legal teams. I love this product because if there is a glitch they actually walk you through it."
7beauties7,1,5,"Bitdefender consistently scores high with the independent reviewer of anti-virus programs, av-comparatives.org.  It runs silently in the background without performance penalty and updates itself everyday."
James C,7,1,I purchased a Computer Tune-Up and Virus & Spyware Removal service.  The customer service to implement this is so poor I want a refund as soon as possible.  Customer service promised a refund in 7 days and I haven't received anything in over a month. I chased them and I received zero reply. They are thieves.I attempted to complete the service using your live chat service but after 5 attempts at different times of the day your agents were always unavailable.   I tried to call your phone call center 3 times and I got cut off 2 minutes into the call each time.  They never called back.  I also left a voicemail message and I have not received a call back.  This is unacceptable given the amount of money I paid for these packages.I only paid for the tune-ups as part of your upselling. It sounded like your customer service team said I didn't need it as I had the antivirus product installed. Then why upsell it? It sounds like mis selling to me
Fraser.,7,5,"It’s a pretty strong defence against intrusions I believe, (Not one of those things I personally want to test with a virus), Chose Bitdefender from tech reviews I’ve read on the net and they all seemed to vote it tops.Easy to use and has a blindingly helpful customer support team.Like all Anti Virus Software it does play Mother and stops you from loading some rather innocuous app’s but it’s easy to rectify with a couple of clicks.I turned to Bitdefender because the last one,Norton, I’d been using for the past 15 years became too intrusive.Over all 10/10 very pleased."
cavicautus,1,5,"Nothing worth doing comes easy... And there is no doubt that unfamiliarity is often present with most things new to us. Bitdefender Total Security, like other security software has hoops through which we must jump to set up our desired security protection... It takes time, patience and understanding (knowledge is nothing without understanding). But be sure of one thing, Bitdefender Customer Care have 'always' (I speak only for myself) pulled out the stops to ensure any issues are resolved to my satisfaction in an extremely friendly, professional and easy to understand way. The Bitdefender Customer Care team appear always willing to resolve any issue related to Bitdefender... Unlike other services, its Customer Care team seem unscripted, and that they know what they are talking about when communicating with you... That's a real personal touch! Thank you Bitdefender."
Robert M,6,5,Bitdefender has all the online protection from hackers who want to steal your personal info and also virus and malware protection you will ever need and has best price for their service.
TR King,4,1,"Wanting to get rid of some annoying promotional nuisance-ware, I downloaded free Bitdefender.  It won't run with another anti-virus installed. I paused my Kaspersky but all that then happened was that Bitdefender started removing it.  Fortunately Kaspersky interrupts that exercise smartly.   It isn't necessary for that to happen.  It's underhand, too.   It is hardly a good advertisement."
Danni Rasmus Hansen,4,1,"Have been using Bitdefender since 2010 and this time i wasn't happy with their product (it blocked all acces to my whole pc and internet) so i wrote to them to use the 14 regret days rule, after 6 days. They wrote back when I asked how to get my money back, but after showing them their own rule, from their own homepage, they have ignored me and I pretty much believe they won't stand by their own rules now. How can i support a company, which have become money hungry? I can't.EDIT: After they wrote to me, i wrote them back, trying to find a solution. AGAIN i have not heard anything from them. It's only a trick to make it look like they care about my case with a reply. They are full of crap and does not care at all for my safety, and keep breaking the law in my country."
yousef abdalla,1,1,Installed paid version last year and made computer unstable (Windows 10). Little to no support from Bitdefender once they have your money. Uninstalled and computer working fine. Unfortunately auto renewed last week and computer keeps crashing again and have to try and remove it again. Beware auto renewal as I have now wasted money twice on this product which I haven’t been able to use.
Juha Kärki,8,5,
Julia Sich,1,5,I live in New Zealand and use Bitdefender to protect my Mac book pro.  I had three files that Bitdefender couldn't disinfect and I couldn't delete them either.  I set up a remote session quickly and easily to get the problem fixed. It took the support engineer three long hours but I was so impressed with the service and skill level to achieve it.  I have every confidence in them as a team.
Bill,1,5,This product works! It protected me at least twice from having my hard drive locked.
Dashiell Yue Sakamoto,1,5,"Aside from the advance protection bitdefender is giving my PC, the customer service is to be commended for. Excellent customer service!"
Dirk,13,2,Beware Aurorenewers !!!!Beware Aurorenewers !!!!I have been using Bitdefender for a few years and have an autoremewal in place. I received an email stating that I could avail of a cheaper fee than the standard renewal fee(a month prior to the renewal date )Unbeknownst to me this does not nullify the original auto renewal that is in place ! So I have the privilege of being charged twice (one month apart ) for the same service !........to add insult to injury Bitdefender support told me that because i hadn't noted it within 30 days that a refund was not permissible.I have now demanded that the auto renewal be removed and moving forward will be using another provider when this cover expires..what a farce !!! Avoid this company like the plague!=========This was mentioned before and I have exactly the same story. Even worse! I received an email at 09:48 this morning that my product would auto renew in 0 days. And the money was taken out of my account at 10:52! The product can be good but these are unacceptable practices.
Katietoo,1,5,"Bitdefender Total Security is clear and easy to use and just works away, unobtrusively in the background. However, having their small Widget on my desktop, by merely glancing at it occasionally, keeps me up-to-date with my security protection and always immediately informs me of any changes to my security and/or related messages. On a couple of occasions I have needed to use their Online Chat.  These were for two separate small queries and both times I received prompt, courteous and full responses, and, also, equally good follow-ups before they closed my case numbers. It's great to know that this Online Chat facility is there, if ever I should need it for a really serious problem."

Ron Drinkwater,3,5,generally works well.I had trouble with and update but now resolved
Jeffery,7,1,They are the most useless security company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with I chose to try there software after hearing several positive reviews however there software seems to do nothing although it says it's fine it doesn't seem to work and the support team is laughable they are the most clueless team I have ever seen they don't even know there own software let alone anything else they haven't got a clue what they are doing and honestly are a waist of time. They haven't provided any support at all. The support team is a complete joke as they don't even know the first thing about there product.
Jørgen Evald,7,5,A window appeared on my screen stating that a failure introduced by a Bitdefender program was hampering my screen presentation . I contacted Bitdefender support and was adviced to reinstall the entire Bitdefenderprogram - and I did and the problem was solved
Iggy,1,5,As a repeat customer I feel secure with the services provided by Bitdefender. I not only would recommend to friends and family but would encourage anyone on the fence about trying their service.  Their weekly security reports and activity notifications give me piece of mind while using all my devices.  True Story. ;)
Kiliedu Travel & Tours,1,5,They have listened and take care of my issue real professionallyI contacted the Bitfinder customer care center and helped me appropriately.
Lloyd Stevenson,1,5,"Product was easy to download, install and use. If ever any question, BitDefender personnel are available 24/7."
Robert Strongbow,2,5,"Bitdefender is the top-of-the-line in Computer & Internet Security, and their Customer Care Team goes the extra mile to ensure Bitdefender users are totally safe and secure in Computer & Internet Security!Thank You Bitdefender, you make your users feel like part of The Bitdefender Team!"
Derrick Timms,3,4,Good product that I have used for a good number of years with very few technical problems which have been quickly solved. The only problems I have had really is that it appears internally at Bitdefender internal communications are not so good as they should be.
Carol O'Connor,2,5,I have had Betdefender for several years. Warns you when you go to a site that is unsafe. Easy to get help on line. If they can't fix you are refered on and they communicate with you until problem solved. I have 3 computers on the one account.
billybob,7,5,I have used a few antivirus programs over the years and have been infected more than once...since using bitdefender I have never been infected once  superb...what else can I say ...I'm sticking with it
Robert Shunk,1,5,I have found Bitdefender to be very good at securing my computer.
Bryan Amery,2,5,"Bitdefender is simple to use, comprehensive and completely reliable. The support is the best I have encountered on any website."
Lowell Sonne,2,5,"I have been a very satisfied customer for over a decade. Their Total Security software is very effective with keeping your desktop, laptop, tablet, phone & others, safe from malware-viruses, safe while surfing-shopping-banking or reading, safe with automatic updates and a very user friendly dashboard. I strongly recommend any of their products (either personal or business) for your peace of mind."
Desperate Hausfrau,6,1,"Sadly nothing but a payment scam. If you have ever bought from this company, even years ago, check your statements!!!"
Thomas O,65,4,Fine product and better pricing than norton.The VPN add on solution apparently also for devices in the package and not just a single one like norton. That makes it very expensive when you have norton and 2 - 3 devices for every family member ;-)
Dominique D'haene,1,5,not a single bad experience encountered in all those years I use Bitdefender
Chris Vesey,3,5,"Bitdefender is easy to install and use and is reasonably priced, their live chat responds quickly and is very helpful"
K Pitman,1,5,I have had Zero problem with viruses and malware since I started using Bitdefender 5 or 6 years ago.  It just runs and does the job with no interruptions of slowdowns to my work.  It almost like its not there.
Pete Wells,2,5,"In my opinion Bitdefender is a great product which I have used for a number of years now. It's easy to install, covers all aspects of system security and is backed up by very efficient and helpful customer service."
T. Reichle,1,5,"I experienced some trouble with passwords and resets and the dashboard, from the beginning.  It seems better since it was uninstalled and restored.  I have always been impressed with the standing of this app, relative to others, like Kaspercy, which my brother swears by."
Andrew Pokolinski,1,5,This program is very reliable and easy to use.  Customer service is excellent and they are very hellpful.
David Roberts,1,5,"It is foolproof  and does not slow down the computer , even when scanning."
Ian Lee,1,5,"I wanted to upgrade my subscription to include cover for my mac, before my auto renew date,this was made possible by shortening my subscription period so that the cover was immediately started rather than having to purchase a separate subscription or wait for renewal.This I felt was a good solution, as I now have peace of mind at no extra cost."
Linda Newman,1,5,"I have enjoyed Bitdefender services for several years. Encountered problems with Windows 10 Updates and loss of sound. I tried Troubleshooting, manually updating over 2 dozen times, and contacting HP and Microsoft without success. Bitdefender could not  successfully complete the updates automatically or manually either, so I contacted Customer Support. My representative gave me suggestions to try and direction. After doing a corrupt file repair, updates still could not complete. So I did recovery and updates completed after that. However, the laptop lost audio. After troubleshooting failed to find problems, I contacted my Bitdefender representative. Again, I was given suggestions and direction which worked. I am very appreciative and grateful to the Bitdefender representative that had the patience to help me through these problems. I have recommended Bitdefender to other family members and friend's families. This is the first security service that has actually provided customer service support and secured my devices superbly."
Reg Grove,1,5,"* Have had Bitdefender for about 5 years now.  * It doesn't slow down down my computer like other antivirus programs I have used.  * All the antivirus stuff is all automated, so I do not have to do anything to keep my computer safe.  * If I need assistance, I can telephone 24/7,365 and get a human to help. Have never waited more than a few minutes to talk to a representative. Every time I have called, my problem has been solved."
Maureen Anderson:,2,5,"Bitdefender has been my go to for over 4 years, when getting a new computer or laptop. I really appreciate their banking program for on line as I have even had my primary say that notices have been refused; do to ""Spam"".  Great program to work with and know that I'm safe."
Amrit Sood,3,4,Should Not Have So Many Exchange of Messages to Finally Resolve The Matter!
hexaboss bossman,1,4,"Good. English could be better. If they had Swedish support it would be a 5/5 as talking/writing only in English is very boring. Product is very solid sheit and you won't be disappointed. Just avoid the Premium VPN, bad sheit sailing around that particular part."
Mr John Gifford,6,5,"Some antivirus software slows your computer down mine does not do this its just the normal antivirus plus package i have got and IT WORKS that's why i trust Bit Defender to protect me, it takes out the spam it even tells me if i try to go on sites that may try to take information from me by dubious means, it will not stop you but a warning comes up telling you the risks you may be taking, i have had this and backed out no sense in going against an antivirus if its trying to protect you and that it was this does.i have recently been in touch with their customer service i wanted to know what VPN was and if i had to pay extra for it, well they do give you 200mb free but the rest you have to pay for extra, worth it if you are browsing outside away from your modem, the service was 1st class, i wish all people were like this. If you have not got Bit Defender get it it does what it says on the pack and more."
Adrian Rylatt,1,5,Great product!  World-class customer service.
Mark Engle,2,5,Have not had any issue with stuff getting thru to harm my computer

Corey Wel,1,5,"Great product lots of options.level of protection is better then other security software I've used in the past. Can be awkward to setup, Bitdefender central is handy to upgrade, get new products and review your protection on multiple devices.Awesome customer service / live chat is great."
David Morey,70,5,"They do have really special offers on their latest security systems and you have to be quick to nab one I paid 50 % off their list price and if I waited I could have got more but having a very reliable security package on my internet equipment makes me feel very protected and would not use anyone else now,so that speaks for itself in recommending others."
Luv2Rite11,2,5,"BD has done me well. I sleep knowing they're protecting my personal computer. They block pop ups, give me advice that most always I understand. If I don't understand I can call their toll free number and are very courteous and pleasant folks to call. If they ever drop their toll free number, I'll go elsewhere. They are an excellent company that thus far, I've opted to have BD protect a highly value object in the care of their hands with."
Andy,1,5,"I had some billing issues.  I went through the ticket system and whilst things seemed to be progressing slowly and were frustrating at times, I'm pleased to say everything was sorted out to my satisfaction.  BitDefender customer support were very helpful and resolved all my issues.  I am very happy.  Thanks Andrei for all your help, much appreciated.(This was originally posted as a bad review due to my frustration with the ticket system, but I feel I must update this review to 5* now, as their customer service has been superb).  Thanks again, you have a great product and a long term customer here.  Best wishes Andy"
Bill Brock,1,5,"We've been using using Total Security, Box 2, and VPN subscription for 2 years.  The products provide great multilevel security across all my devices and my home network.  The support staff is competent and responsive.Bitdefender consistently scores high on independent testing."
Richard Estes,1,4,"Had some trouble with installing and configuring the product, but the kindness and efficiency of the customer support team convinced me to not pursue other options for my Linux PC."
Jonah Garcia (JMGRoblox),11,5,Bitdefender is a useful antivirus against malware and viruses. Even the free version is effective! Has helped me detect more than 2 viruses!

Josh,1,5,"Bitdefender has kept my computers safe and virus/malware-free for years. Moreover, the customer service is excellent; the two or three times I've had a question, my support ticket was responded to very quickly, and the response has always answered my question/solved my problem completely (never needed a follow-up)."
GREG  Ferres (Digital Perception),3,5,Bitdefender was very quick to remove an issue with my iMac. happy Chappy. Thanks.

Zenoch,3,5,"Great AV, support team and utilities. For its price, amazing."
Claire,1,5,"Basically a wide range of system failures happened, mostly during end of month, I was once again, a target of malicious electronic attack, with no payment method available, Bitdefender was there to help with my System security and why not, my psychosis too."
Joanne Borolla,1,5,"I have tried a number of security services over the years and Bitdefender is my preferred choice.  Little to no up-sell; I have a choice of the products I want and need.  Recently I had a question for customer service.  It took a little while to speak to an agent but once I did, he was thorough and ensured I had my questions answered."
Briant Stevanus,1,5,"Bitdefender is a great IT Security Services company, with great technical perspective and great customer relation."
Stefan,1,5,The best antivirus you can find on the market in 2019.
Paula Naude,2,5,
Hugh Briggs,1,5,"I have been a BitD user for a number of years now, and they have added to the suite several times. I use the OneClick Optimizer frequently, which speeds up my OS by getting rid of junk files. The web anti-tracking seems to work well with Firefox, and also shows which trackers have been blocked from which websites. These tools are in addition to their antivirus software, which is consistently rated as among the best. Finally, on the few occasions when I have required (forgotten passwords and the like) they have responded within 24 hours with a solution that worked the first time. Kudos."
Charles Hand,1,4,"So far, very satisfied with Bitdefender and customer service."
Stephen Smithee,1,5,Bitdefender support is quick and thorough. It's always on in the background with little resource usage. It updates very frequently with no fuss. I think it lives up to it's reputation as the best antivirus out there. I highly recommend it to everyone.
Sanjay Washington,18,2,"I purchased Bitdefender on reviews from internet. I by mistake clicked twice for the payment. The customer service was courteous to either refund the money or have 2 years of subscription. I still have a year and two months of subscription left which I cannot wait to finish. The reason why is because it super intrusive and annoying. It stops me from using bittorrent (ransomware)?It very frustrating how many times I had to uninstall the app to download something. I mean the owner of the laptop who has paid £1000 is not worried about a malware but Bitdefender who is worth £32.00 seems more worried. Its doing it's job perfectly I believe as some would say, but to stop your downloaded programs and persistently not letting you install is absolutely annoying.Once I finish the remaining time of subscription I will look for something else."
Philip,6,5,"Greatly Exceeded Expectations.I travel a lot for work and know the importance of a good review in helping to make informed choices when not in your own turf.  PC defense is one of those increasingly opaque areas and there is so much noise on the internet about making a choice to protect your digital footprint.As such I am highly skeptical of any review or recommendation for computer security software.  My wife contracted a Trojan on her Mac.  A nasty one that tried to hijack critical systems.  I tried a number of approaches to resolve the issue, but with the browsers hijacked as well I couldn't download anything.I subscribe to a 5 licence copy of Bitdefender for my PC and peripherals.  I contacted them by instant message and within minutes had been directed to a file I could download and install on a stick to resolve this specific cluster of viruses on her mac.Completely cleaned it up, I then installed the full Bitdefender and it found 2 more Trojans waiting in the background and cleaned them up.Excellent diagnostics, excellent cleaning tool, excellent protection, excellent customer service."
John Wittneben,2,5,"I was complaining about my computer defense system, AVG was always adding features (ones I already thought were covered). So, I went from a free service to a rather expensive one that kept getting more expensive. AVG worked very well but the value just wasn't there anymore. A friend recommended Bitdefender and helped me remove AVG and install this. I had one problem but customer service was able to solve it for me with one email!This is why I think others need to follow and try Bitdefender."
Maurycy Domaradzki,6,5,"Bitdefender is the best antivirus software I have tried, and I have tried many in the past."
Michael,2,5,You won't beat this company or their products. Use any other software and you're wasting your money
Brad Dooley,2,1,This software is worse than a virus or malware.  Nigh on impossible to remove the software.  Also regardless of what boxes you click they try to auto resubscribe you! Very difficult to get a refund when they do.
Gábor Nagy,1,5,"I am using their products for years now with no major problem. It does what it should silently in the background. Also, the company has a great and responsive support team if you're having issues."
Niel Daly,5,5,Excellent features and extremely secure. Great value for money and ability for multiple licenses. All the computers and phones at home have had no issues for years with Total Security. Completely trust Bitdefender and highly recommend it.
Bruce Lawrence,2,5,I Have had Bitdefender on my Computer for 5 years and am very happy with the Product. When ever I had any questions the representative was very helpful.
Michael Koutalianos,1,5,"Excellent, easy-to-use App. Does exactly what it promises. Great Customer Support team!"
Sam,2,5,"Using it on Mac, windows and my phones. It is great and is always getting better, staying current with customers need. Love the banking features and the new Microphone feature.I think no other security solution comes close."
Jesse Thompson,2,5,Customer Service and Website are clear and easy to use.  Thanks!
G Ward,1,1,I had bitdefender and uninstalled it. I now get pop offers every 5 minutes (SoSo annoying) Can't seem to get rid of it. Web site was not helpful and I have to do some e-ticket. All too much for a 60 year old.
mecbain,1,5,"Very good management of the whole security solution, they're interfaces make something that has a certain complexity (different available options for the security solution) easy to understand and use.The new parental surveillance feature is pretty cool, haven't really tested it to see how well it works though."
Karthic A,1,5,It works perfectly. No unnecessary notifications. Customer service is excellent. Exactly what you'd expect
Sahil RAJ Dwivedi,1,5,It is cheap and best and most importantly it is very light on the CPU and it also increases system performance.
Peter,1,4,i have been with Bitdefender for several years and had exellent service for a great price.
Squiffy Q,2,1,"So many 5-star fake one-name reviews. Egads. So here's a real one from a real user:  I have BitDefender on Win 7 (desktop) and Win 10 (laptop). I hate it. Does it do the job? Absolutely. But it's annoying. When you boot up, it does a system check for you (good) but it takes 3 freaking windows that pop up over 4 minutes or so to tell you that everything is working. Four minutes is a long time in computer-land - I'm already into something, but have to stop everything because these 'check' windows interrupt overtop of what you're doing.Also, it never fully installs. It's always a grey icon in the system tray, never goes red (complete) because it says, ""Due to a failure, some modules are not available right now. Clicking enable will force a recheck that may fix this issue.""   No, it doesn't. So what am I missing? What have I paid for that's not working? No idea. I'm stuck with this thing for a year, but I will not renew. It's invasive, annoying, and doesn't do the full job you paid for, which is a ripoff."
Terry Bradley,6,1,"Some of these five star reviews are obviously fake. The reason that I know that is because my personal experience is nothing like those reviews would lead you to believe.For example, I have just had to remove Bitdefender after two months of trying to get along with it. I have a vanilla win10 installation and nothing special or out-of-the-ordinary.Bitdefender will not let me connect to my USB devices such as my hiking GPS even when I turn it off. The only option is to complete de-install it which defeats the objects of having AV in the first place. Other AV usually has a simple turn off button. Not bitdefender.Also, those statements about customer service?I have tried contacting bitdefender numerous times including chat and never once have I had any response.Do not waste your money like I have."
Dan,3,5,"There's more than one reason why BD is so highly rated by independent reviewers, with functionality, ease of use, price, and quality of customer service being among them."
Rodger,1,5,"I purchased multiple devices as well as extended periods of use activated. At special prices and affordable rates I grabbed the opportunity and is not only a long standing user, but now also a promoter of the product. If it is working for me others should know about it. In between discounts help a lot. Thank you BD."
Ubavka Corovic,1,5,
barbara fisk,1,5,Bitdefender is a great product and their customer service and online chat is excellent. I would recommend this protection to everyone. If you are nervous about the installation the help available is really good.
Dafydd Ifans,2,5,"A thorough and dependable security programme.The customer services department is full of lively, knowledgeable, members of staff who respond to emails in a courteous way."
Kaffeguy,7,5,I've been using Bitdefender for many years and it has proven to be extremely effective. It favors well and high with the independent testing and stops viruses at its track. Customer service is always available via email and the few times I have needed them they answer your question immediately with a response and full details on how to resolve the problem you are having. They genuinely care as they follow up on the status of your problem and want to know if you had any difficulty. I've never had an issue where I needed to call. I would and have recommended Bitdefender to friends and colleagues and they are amazed at the speed.
Rico Bastiaanse,1,5,I’am a satisfied user of Bitdefender services. Allways good support from the servicedesk. The software works fine. As an user of the Box2 firewall for home networks all devices within the network ( cable and wifi )are secured. Great value for money.
Dave Hodge,2,5,"A very easy company to deal withif/when you need support, and no question is too small or silly for them.A great product with lots of features which are becoming increasinly important in the modern work of both business and home computing.High recommend that people look at their product offering when their existing provider renewals come up!"
Carol G,1,1,"I have purchased Bitdefender for three years now an this is my last! The software does not work most of the time as Bitdefender's idea of ""internet security"" is to prevent you for using any website. I have to use my computer at work because this software will prevent me for accessing my bank, my school, and pretty much anything by giving me a message that says ""site is not secure...back to safety"" or just plainly will not load the page. The websites load at work but not with Bitdefender at home so it tells me that their ""security"" is pretty much not there at all. Do not buy it as it was good years ago but now is pretty much offering no security at all. My Norton protected my computer even if I was in a public network. The worst part is that the Chat people at Bitdefender admitted that there was nothing they could do other than dump my complaints to their supervisors. Several of them have been telling me that they were moving my complaing to the “next level up…” for months but this week of August 2019, two of those chat people finally admitted that there is no ""second level of support..."" or anything like that. I got the screenshots from them admitting just that...that they have been stringing me along for months telling me that they are sending my complaint to the ""next level..."" but when I told the one today that I have never received a call or an email from that ""next level..."" the chat person then plainly told me that there is nothing Bitdefender can do to fix the bad software and that there will be never ever a “second level…” contact of anything to fix the bad or non-working software. I got the screenshot to prove it!.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is my response to Bitdefender's answer below.First of all, I do not have a ticket number as your chat people said that they cannot fix what your software has wrong so they have never send me an email, at least not the last two months, with a ticket number so there is no number of ticket to give you. Second, I have a Sprint hot spot that has worked just fine with your software since April 2018. I have had other hot spots before that date and there was nothing wrong. However, as soon as I complained last year of your software not working. In April last year, I began getting messages saying my web page was ""not safe"", the same bank website, the same school site, etc that I have been using for years. There were no longer safe. That is when I noticed that now you had a VPN that kept showing up telling me to get it to get to my pages ""safely."" I ignored it for most of the year and then my web sites, with the same hots spot, worked just fine after I complained for nearly three weeks to you at your Bitdefender chat. Then now the campaign started again when your company began posting a small window saying that the same Sprint hot spot was no longer safe again in April of this year 2019. However, this time the campaign to get me to pay $40 bucks for your ""VPN upgrade"" got really bad and your Btidefender is not letting me access any of the banking sites and same web pages that were ""safe"" for about 9 months and the VPN box began to show up every single time I logged into the internet with the same hot spot. It is not a coincidence but a really open push to get us customers to buy that VPN that is not even yours but a patch work from some other company. I then gave in and purchased the VPN and paid the $40 bucks which is what you have been trying to push the customers to do other wise you will keep their web pages for loading at all. I tried ti and guess what, it does not work! The VPN you sell is so slow it takes about three minutes or more for even a plain bank website to load. I then cancelled it and tried to purchase TOTAL AV as they have VPN already included in the subscription. Well, I could not as out of the blue, my computer ended up without any protection at all and every single software I tried to purchase, yes I tried several just to see if it was just my imagination, turned into web pages in Russian! So someone was trying really hard to prevent me for purchasing another antivirus software. I then called your chat place to complain about the same, pages not loading, my hots spot becoming ""public"" even after I had set it up as private, the hot spot turning off as ""unsafe"" all the time after months of being ""safe"" to your software, and I got the surprise of my life when two chat people told me in plain English that ""they could not help me at all"" with my issue. I even told one of them that I was sure that all this started right after the pop-up messages asking me to purchase VPN from Bitderender started to show up and they still stated that they could not help me and will ""escalate it to the next level."" Check those chats and you will see it right there and again, I never received an email with a ticket or a follow up from Bitdefender in the last two weeks or even this week after my complaint this past Sunday August 11, 2019. Just go ahead and show my chats to the people on this site and they will see that it my computer is being held at ramsom by Bitdefender. I either pay extra 40 bucks to patch up your Bitdefender with a VPN or I will not get protection at all and none of my websites will load up at all. This week end I am uninstalling your software even though I still have 140 days to go, I will resent my computers as TOTAL AV said you leave garbage behind that messes up the new software on purpose, they will help me on this, and you will be history. I paid for a total software protection and will not be pushed to keep paying extra after Bitdefender decided to start taking some of the protection away and start charging for them in piecemeal and one item at a time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Browser issues? Really? I have been using the same browsers and certificates from  Chrome, Explorer, and Firefox with you Bitdefender software for years with the same hot spots from Sprint and Verizon. Both  worked fine with your software before the VPN craze started last year with all the Antivirus Software. Then suddenly in February 2019 that same hot spots became so unsafe that I had to buy VPN from Bitdefender or there will be no online banking or anything for me? I have your Bitdefender installed in three devices; a three year old PC, a two months old laptop, and a three weeks old brand new Android phone, all having  three different manufacturers, all using three different browsers, and you think it is a browser issue? Out of the blue all three now need VPN and if I do not buy your VPN, nothing loads and every single website is dangerous and I have to go back to safety. Give me a break!  This weekend of August 10 and 11, 2019, your Tech chat people at Bitdefender Central  finally told me that that there is nothing they can do for a customer if the Bitdefender software does not work (yes they said that!), that sometimes the software does not work with people's devices so tough luck, or that they need to ""escalate"" my case, or needs to go to  ""High priority."" Pretty much what you just offered but guess what, after months of complaining to Bitdefender via phone and chat, nobody at your company has opened a ticket for this issue, or called me, or did anything other than ask me for my PC's specs and then no ticket, not email, no ""escalated"" help, nothing in five months other than the pop-up VPNs from Bitdefender asking me to pay 40 bucks to fix this new ""security"" problem now that you decided to charge customers again for the same security features or patches. Too late. I just purchased Norton 360 2020 Deluxe. It was VPN and I do not need to pay extra for it. If they have to patch their software, I am sure Norton will not charge extra to customers for it. Go ahead and keep the rest of my 140 days of subscription as I am just glad I will not have to deal with your company anymore. As a favor, I can only ask you to have some decency and stop smearing your own business with unfair business practices."
Carlton Dickens,1,5,"Use Bitdefender for my company. Ease of use, low impact on processing. Rarely have issues but when I do, support is excellent."
SA,1,1,"Decent anti-virus protection for Mac and I would give more stars but for one problem. The issue is that (as far as I can tell - I have searched and contacted their customer service) you are made to have the Bitdefender VPN. You can only download the whole Bitdefender package - when you use Bitdefender it appears to automatically install the VPN and there is seemingly no ability to stop this. I also have found no way on Mac to uninstall the VPN on its own and keep Bitdefender anti-virus. I have already paid for a separate VPN so I do not want Bitdefender VPN clogging up my system. I should be able to just use the anti-virus. On this basis I have stopped using Bitdefender so I can only give it 1 star.I am happy to amend this review if Bitdefender can confirm that you can either stop the VPN being installed or remove it on its own on Mac, but I have yet to find a way to do this."
Tom Gurda,1,5,"Been using Bitdefender for years and never have had an issue of any sort. I like how 1 package, 1 price covers multiple products that I own. I've used other security suites in the past and have not been pleased. One with a Kaspersky engine even started deleting safe files after an update of its algorithms. I am a happy user!"
Jeff,3,5,"I know I had a really good product but wasn't sure of how good their support would be. The time I had a problem, they responded quickly and resolved all my issues. They were patient enough to listen to all my queries and responded to all of them without using generic answers that most support teams resort to. I am a very happy customer."
Ron Phinney,1,1,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced form any entity. I purchased box 2 and total security based on reviews.  Box slowed home network down and gave very frequent alerts. ( sometimes dozens within a 5 minute period ) asking to allow or block items through firewall.  No good explanation if they are risky or not.  Streaming to our TVs is terrible.  After 5 days and many promises from customer support, no one from the box support department has gotten back to me.  I was told they are very busy.  VIP SUPPORT USELESS, and would not address other issues until box support contacted me.  I expect more from VIP Support for $9.99 a Month as they can’t handle box issues, but they told me I would be called by box support in 5 to 10 minutes—This was 5 days ago!  Have called several times since to no avail.  A product is only as good as it’s  customer service, which I would rate as -0."
Mary Askew,14,5,"I have used BitDefender for several years and it has never let me down. It blocks dangerous websites effectively and comes out high in lab tests year after year. It is easy to use with many useful features to protect the user in all aspects of the internet, and also to keep your computer running smoothly.  The price is reasonable and the customer support is excellent."
Jon Champs,16,4,"I would give them 5 stars for functionality and protection, value for money, but their annual renewal process is an annual nightmare - every year the same hassle for the same reason, they just never get round to understanding what its problems are or fixing it."
Liam Murphy,13,2,The Antivirus is good but the VPN is a joke. For years every time I renew it takes multiple attempts to get to work and this has clearly not been rectified by the development team.As a result after many years I will now move to another product
Mark de Boer,1,1,"Worst customer care i have ever seen. My subscription was automatically renewed and i payed for a full year. Afterwards my bitdefender software stopped working ""license expired"". I did send severall messages to customer care (ticket no: 2019080119140004). I have not heard anything for 5 days now. Good software but the worst support i have ever experienced..."
Rune Olofsson,19,5,The highest quality and speed in computer and smartphone safety in every way!
THE SQUAD,1,1,An absolute sh**e antivirus because it doesn't know what's a virus and what's not. It blocks all of my games from saving all my important downloads and all of my word documents. This antivirus gets a solid 1 out of 10. Wouldn't recommend. Oh by the way I f**king pay for it. Go use a much more reliable antivirus like avast or AVG. Thanks for reading.
Margaret Neagle,1,1,"purchased2020 antivirus  total but unable to download iwould prefer you to refund my order.order no. 1011422920 3rd august 2019.,                 bneagle@iprimus .com.au           thank you"
Robo,26,5,"If you are looking for a good AntiVirus Security programme, then try BitDefender Total Security, I've been using it now for over five years and it has kept my PC, Laptop & Mobile Phone free of any infrinsments.  It really is the best."
Hekaveli,4,5,Bitdefender solved automatically a problem I had with my former virusprotection software. The technical support has been excellent especially compared to the other software I've been using during these years. Only con is: you have to have some skills of English.
Kevan Fitzakerley,1,5,"Bitdefender is the best protection software suite I have ever used and had. Just renewed my subscription with a very good renewal reward offer. After sales support is excellent. Kevan Fitzakerley, Australia."
J. Bass,1,5,I researched several anti-virus programs before deciding on Bitdefender. Bitdefender has now protected 3 of my PC’s for the past 2 years and I just added my iPad. The user interface is easy to follow and customer service is outstanding.
Keith Aston,1,5,"Total Security 2019Been a customer for a number of years, use on all my devices, not only a great product an excellent support network....Would recommend."

Gabriel-Catalin Rusu,1,5,Second year under bitdefender shield. Really happy with their services. Never had a problem. Would really recommend.
Mason Morgan,1,5,"I purchased a subscription in 2018. From April thru June I didn't have a permanent home base. I bought a new laptop and have several different computers on the subscription. Recently after starting to use the new laptop more extensively, I kept getting a subscription expired notice. After contacting support and reprocessing the subscription and reinstalling the software, all was back to normal. I believe the software pkg is very complete with security apps for every aspect of connected computing. Their support at setup and through this recent problem was excellent"
Mizra Hatunic,5,5,Rly god and rly ez protection on all of my machines also no need to go out off auto pilot. Strongly recommend!
Raymond,1,5,"We have been using Bitdefender for many years now; all with no problems at all -- so their systems work.  Everything has been so easy -- regular updates are easily done for me (I am NOT technological at all); and when I decided to use their free Support service for a blacklist/whitelist problem with a certain URL -- their communication on the issue was immediate; and they fixed it VERY quickly.  In an era when people hide behind technology and ignore their customers, this is wonderful service, and shows a true commitment to high quality customer service, with a high quality product.  HIGHLY recommended."
Simon,22,1,"Paid for Adware removal service - these shysters ran CCleaner and Malwarebytes - not even their own software, then ran a quick scan using their own - not a full scan - which unsurprisingly meant they missed Adware and Trojans.  A complaint is met with ""have a great day"" level of patronising brushoffs. I will NEVER us them again.  Unprofessional and worthless service equal to a poor amateur level of support."
Rushdi A.B.,1,5,Bitdefender is excellent.  Work silently without interupting my work on my PC.  At time i have to double check whther its running.  Customer support is great too!.  The online support is excellent
juliana pessoa,1,5,"I had a problem with my subscription and they just did a wonderful job assisting me and making me feel I was important to them. The responses were FAST, REALLY FAST and precise. I will continue with Bitdefender forever. They are truly the best customer service ever."
Paul Arenson,1,5,Easy to use and help is very concise and reassuring
Aleksei,1,5,one of the most unobtrusive and non-booting antivirus. with flexible infusions system. I like that.easy to use antivirus
Ellie,5,1,"I downloaded a trial of bitdefender and I decided not to buy it.  However, when I went to remove the program from my computer I learned that I was unable to do so.  Even after I deleted the application, it was still on my dock.  I reached out for instructions on how to remove it and when following the steps, I found that my own computer is telling me that I do not have the permissions necessary to delete the program.  I don't know a lot about computers, but I do know that this feels really sketchy.  The company is giving me two options now for removal:  factory reset my computer or allow them remote access to investigate further.  Either way, I feel like this program did more to violate my security than help protect it."
Vladimir Quintero,1,4,"I wanted to give it five stars, since I have been a satisfied user of BitDefender for several years with no complaint, until this year, when they started to charge additionally for services that should be part of a security system as is the case of Adware Removal, which now sells as a 'premium' service.For the first time in more than a decade I am thinking about renewing my subscription or change provider to other that really offers 'Total Security' in one package."
Jonathan Cormuz,1,5,
Robert Pellarin,1,5,"I've been a Bitdefender user for about 7 years and in that time have never had any security issues.  It's been an extremely reliable software and whenever I've had minor issues, their customer support group has always been prompt and helpful in resolving the issue.  In fact, just recently, the support group suggested a remote session to help resolve a couple of issues I was having.  The technician spent almost an hour an a half working remotely to take care of the issue. Not many companies are prepared to devote that much time to one customer!!  I also like their interface and how clearly they explain the functionality of various modules in their package.  Definitely satisfied!"
gerald,3,5,I have had Bitdefender Total security for the last  2 years and have never had any issues with this product. I recently updated to the 2020 edition and needed some help to transfer my password wallet to the new edition so I called customer service and the walked me through it. I feel very safe when I'm surfing the internet because I know Bitdefender always has my back.
Paul Shep,1,5,Great product and great service if you have any problems with it.

Robert Segal,1,5,"Great security/ AV product, super support. Stongly recommend."
John Villaraza,1,5,Had a problem and immediately contacted support for help. It was very fast and they were very helpful. The antivirus itself? 100% The best.
Listen Islam,1,5,I've been using Bitdefender for more than 5 years and I'm completely happy with it
C,1,5,"Bitdefender offers an excellent and highly trusted product. Customer service is excellent - from installation, billing adjustment when they helped me choose the right product for my needs and a few glitches that needed attention. I’m very impressed at how Customer Service is available at a moments notice via email, phone and chat. Even more so on how the representatives are resourceful, professional, well trained and highly efficient. I highly recommend Bitdefender!"
Craig Williamson,1,5,"The two Romanian experts who dealt with me were outstanding - true patient experts. I trust the Bitdefender company and Bitdefender,  the product."
Björn Bengtsson,17,5,Great product for all my devices to a good price with excellent human customer support!
Judy,1,5,"I highly recommend Bitdefender, not only for the product itself, which gives me great confidence about the safety of our computers, and its ease of use, but also for their exceptional customer service."
Linda Salas,1,5,Impressed with Bitdefender. Have been with them for about 5 years now. We have gotten great protection and they notify us when they block. I was pleasantly surprised on their customer service support. They are prompt in response to my emails and answer my questions. I recommend them and notice that they are in the top 5 antivirus companies.
vwgolf53,1,2,"I have used Bitdefender for years on Windows7. After purchasing a new computer preloaded with Windows 10, I installed BD. So far so good. Until Windows10 updated. Suddenly I'm getting a stream of Bitdefender alerts asking me if I want to allow some application or another and then another and then ... access to the www. Nearly all these alerts concern an application with a gobbldygook name that means nothing to me. I bought BD because those guys are supposed to know what is required for windows to operate. If it were my skillset to know what all these applications are, then I wouldn't have shelled out for Bitdefender. Am I frustrated and unimpressed? You bet."
Terence O Brien,1,5,"Contacted Bitdefender on the Internet.Spoke with a Representative, within a few minutes, explained my problem, to Marion.She guided me, with courtesy and great patience to resolving my problem. As i am not very computer literate, this made her task of resolving same, that little bit harder. Followed her instructions, problem was rectified, within 10 mins. I thanked her for her patience, in the heat of the moment, i accidentally cut her off, which i apologized for later."
Rick Ruschel,1,1,"This is about the Bitdefender customer service. I purchased their VPN product and found it to be very slow, WHEN IT ALLOWED ME TO BROWSE. Mostly, I got website unavailable messages. Within an hour of purchase, I realized it wasn't a good fit and requested a refund. All I have gotten for the last week is customer service stalling and refusing to return my money.The AV suite is GREAT, but I won't deal with thieves. It's too bad, because I like their AV suite, just not the VPN (a separate subscription)."
Nigel Holmes,31,5,"Following a problem with my Mac - it wouldn't boot up - I had to re-install the operating system and the apps which came with the original using the Time Machine. As my Bitdefender app was not on there, I went to the site to download again but the Link didn't work. I contacted Bitdefender on their chat service but there was a long delay before a reply came through. Thinking the chat system wasn't working I telephoned and was informed the site was being serviced and could I try to download again later. This I did and had no problems in restoring my A/V. I found Bitdefender very helpful and and keen to ensure my problem was quickly remedied. First rate service."
Luke Philpot,2,1,"The product itself is good. However, the customer service is woeful and the licence renewal process is stupid. I wasted hours on the phone to be told there is no functionality to renew licences through the online platform. I shall no longer try to renew the licences but take my business elsewhere."
Damian Allen,10,5,Great product - very good internet security with smart features. The price is very reasonable. No complaints.
Werner Tebelmann,4,5,"I've been using Bitdefender since it came to the UK. I am using it on Windows and macOS, as well on iPhones and iPads.Minor hickups were always solved quickly by the Support team. Over more than 10 years none of my devices were ever infected!The Family Pack with VPN is great value for money."
Gökhan Kayıran,1,5,Bitdefender is the only one on earth who studies and decrypts on gandcrab ransomware infection. They are absolutely unbeatable.
Travis Elliott,2,5,"Try Bitdefender Total Security paid version for one year. I guarantee that in that time you will not need another program as the many options that are included will more than satisfy all your security needs. And as a bonus, you'll not find better customer support. They don't give up until your issue is resolved."
Mr J J Donnelly,16,5,"Great product easy to use, great coverage of all the danger areas, good price and fantastic customer service."
Robert,28,5,Excllent product (Bitdefender Total Security protecting multiple family devices) used for several years. Support always helpful and reliable
John Lee Baker,1,1,bad news people...have so many products they make you feel like what you bought is insufficient and even though you are in their zone of giving your money back they play a bunch of sneaky games promising your money back but then  they keep asking you to answer some questions in the hope that you will say just forget it...what is really scary is that they keep after you to give up more and more of your personal information and I don't see any difference between their products and the others and actually they seem inferiorthese are not the kind of people you want inside your computer
David,4,5,It does what it was designed to do and the customer/technical support is excellent.
Kristian Dinic,1,5,
Barbara Hendricks,1,2,Annoying pop-ups telling me Bitdefender has blocked something.  Only way to get rid of the pop-ups is to click the X.  So I emailed customer service three separate times....NO RESPONSE at all.
Andrew Page,4,2,Bitdefender will 'auto-renew' at approx double what you need to pay as a new customer. I don't think this is trustworthy behaviour
O. M251,1,5,"I downloaded the trial of complete security for my household. I had a quick question, used chat, got an immediate response/answer. Great software. I will likely use their VPN too."
Jose Marie Trangco,1,5,Simply the Best and ONLY Anti Virus you will need! Unbeatable in its  ability to do Real-Time protection!!
rag nrhs,1,5,Good response not good very very good comparitive others
John Young,1,5,I use Internet Security and surf the net knowing I have protection. And it has caught many issues already that may have been quite harmful.
Sectun,2,5,Efficient operation and user-friendly interface. Great Support!
d. Quandt,1,5,Mac software is vulnerable. I have used this product for 2 years to protect my computer and I phone.  Customer service is excellent. Great value for peace of mind.
jeannette lilley,1,5,"I have had Bitdefender for quite some time now and really love the product. The customer service is second to none, they always respond very quickly to solve any issues with easy to understand instructions."
Juarez Henry,1,5,"Bitdefender not only always does the job, I have never had a single issue with the product and I have always received expert and effective support.  In my case, Bitdefender has been superior to any and all other internet security software products I have tried over the years."
Prince Canice Ifedioranma,1,5,"Bitdefender Antivirus is the perfect and best antivirus that is exiting for now, which everyone suppose to have on their devices for better protection from virus and malware"
Yaser,3,4,bought bitdefender yesterday had a problem with my sub. called and CS was very helpfull.
Andre Sparkfield,2,5,If you want to feel safe when you are on the internet without having to worry or keep checking then Bitdefender just sits there doing the job. Keeping you updated against the newest threats and keeping you on top of vulnerability's. I have been with them for many years and feel confidently safe. Totally recommend Total Security
TFH99,19,5,best security and after sales would recommend highly
Alan Ho,1,5,"Great product. Totally worth it. When having any issues, the customer service was able to resolve it immediately. Definitely recommend it."
Brian,1,4,4 stars as everything can be improved.Far better solution than McAfee that I have used for 25 years.McAfee is incompatible with MS OS Updates.  You have to remove McAfee to update Win OS and then reinstall McAfee.  Changed over after 3 Win OS updates.
Richard,1,5,Wanted to add a new licence as I have used the three that I already had - got a free upgrade to five licences as a loyal customer. Bought another year's subscription as it was half price at the same time. The customer service is second to none.
Virginia Baldwin,1,5,"Bitdefender is the best at what it was designed to do. All apps should be as thorough and easy to use as Bitdefender. Also, Customer Service at Bitdefender is outstanding!"
Brian Omg,1,5,Excellent Tech support.  Very responsive and knowledgeable
Customer  Adrian Lightfoot,28,4,"Very good english in fact the best spoken and written puts me to shame.one problem not sorted, speed of long scan,wanted remote access to my computer .I wouldn't let them have that"
Gayle,1,3,"I have used Bitdefender for several years and liked the quiet, unobtrusive way it guarded my computer. In fact sometimes wished it was more present and operating!HOWEVER - a few days ago it started blocking my every attempt to access the Internet - emails, Firefox and Google searches. I had no choice but to remove it completely from my computer. I tried to contact Bitdefender without success. This is not the first time I have been unable to contact them. I must say, however, that it did detect and block a few serious threats. But I do  not visit sites that could be risky - pretty bland stuff in fact and so have gone back to MS Security Essentials.,"
Diane Taylor,1,5,"I have been with Bitdefender around 7 years now and after having dealt with other's I would never go back to such shotty companies. In this scary world of people trying hard to steal identities and information from us, I can't think of anyone else better to protect you greater than Bitdefender! I never worry with them taking care of my computers, phones, tv, etc, they do it all and it's amazing. I feel extremely confident doing all my banking online and so much more, I encourage anyone to sign up with Bitdefender, put your worries to rest and sit back and enjoy!"
Dan Seeney,1,5,I have used Bitdefender Family pack for a number of years. I can monitor all of our products using Bitdefender Central.  Never had any security issues and support have been superb in resolving an awkward issue on my iMac. I can't fault the product and I can't fault the Support Team.
Haji yakub,1,4,"I have been depressed in the past few years, where my own phone was infringed by someone, at first I did not know who it was, in 2015/16 I did not understand the meaning of ""godam"" and this thing really happened to myself, I was educated  low and do not know anything about computers and ""IT"", because for me computers are just for people with high qualifications.  the worst in 2017-18 & this year 2019. after I found my cellphone hacked, I received an email from GOOGLE.COM along with an arrow folder map mapped to my home, as if my location.  From that he started a notice and learned a little ""hacked"".  after knowing a little bit about how our cell phones were hacked started with the heat of the phone and the battery quickly decreased after use 'only 2 minutes, even if it was charged full battery.various security I ask for help my phone is not encroached or used no tel and personal email.  after subscribing found that the intruders were still able to sign in with their emails and no tel as they did to their crimes, which in the external sense seemed to me to do if it was not investigated in detail. so I tried with the Bitdefender side to see a lack of the past.That all"
Bluewill,2,1,"I have been a loyal Bitdefender customer for more than 5 years. I loved their products up to version 2019. I have a Windows 8.1 PC and starting with version 2019 I could not make Bitdefender IS work any more. The program is not able to start Bitdefender services at startup and after some minutes the PC freezes. I reinstalled Windows 8.1  from scratch and retried to install Bitdefender 2019  recently, but without success. I thought that maybe after one year  from version 2019 release all the bugs would have been ironed out. But I was wrong. If I install back IS version 2018 all functions perfectly. Too bad that Bitdefender didn't try their latest software on Win 8.1 machines. Their technical support is also the worst I have ever come in contact with. They answer once to your problem and then (maybe) after one month, but they don't solve it. Really disappointed. At the end, I decided to go for another European antivirus company and everything now works perfectly. I'm also satisfied because this software doesn't slow down the PC at all. With Bitdefender IS  2018, the PC was never so responsive as it is now. So, try Bitdefender before you buy it, because it is not guaranteed that it will work on your PC and you certainly cannot count on Bitdefender's technical support for help."
Klaus Ellenbeck,3,5,Top data security product for all purposes.
Randy Meigs,1,5,Bitdefender’s reputation is stellar...rated “best” in a number of Computer magazines. The prices are reasonable and customer service is excellent!The installation was easy and the operation is fast and thorough. I would recommend it to anyone as the best Virus Program in the marketplace.
Bailey Ng,1,5,"I used this product few years ago and from there, I don't think I will switch to others knowing that Bitdefender is the best in the world for so many years.  The price is also competitive and currently Bitdefender protected all my five gadgets at home including my mobile phones."
Ghost112,1,1,"Absolute trash.I got bitdefender installed when I got my PC repaired and lets just say, it absolutely SUCKS.It is extremely controlling on what you do with your PC, such as preventing you from creating video game save files and force closing chrome tabs and such for literally no reason. Whats even worse is it doesn't tell you WHY it closed the tab, it just does it and expects you to know. It's also pretty confusing to use and doesn't even like to uninstall, certain files are stuck to your PC after it is installed and you cannot do anything about it. You can't even delete them manually, they're there for ever. I'll never waste a dime on bitdefender in my life. It's literally like using parental controls, and you cannot do anything about it. And also before you say ""Oh how do you know this"" and blah blah blah, my PC never faced these problems until I had bitdefender installed.I'd go on more but I really don't want to. In short Bitdefender is a piece of trash in general and didn't even last 10 hours on my PC. Had it uninstalled within 6 - 7 hours because of how annoying it is."
Alan from Loughton Essex.,2,1,For the second time Bitdefender have taken my money long before my protection has expired. Talking to customer care is a waste of time. I will be closing the card details they have just so they can’t take money when they feel like it. The automatic renewal is a complete con.
Jean-Louis,13,5,"Best ever security program after trying them all over the years. I just wished Bitdefender would reward their loyal customers by offering them their best deals and not just to newcomers. After all, your reputation depends on us, your loyal customers."
Arnorab,56,5,"Works perfectly, is very comprehensive, updates unobtrusively and efficiently in the background, works quickly and effectively to eliminate threats and protect your computer.   Thoroughly recommended and not expensive."
Michael Bentley,1,5,"I can have all my devices covered and protected with one payment, I also get regular updates on my protection to cover new threats. This makes me feel save in the knowledge that I am protected while on the internet."
DONALD,6,5,"My long term internet security package just slowly, over time, lost performance- great security features but was slowing my laptops down to a crawl, sometimes took up to ten minutes to open Outlook or my browser. I researched internet security products, Bitdfender was given high marks for features and performance, decided to give it a try. I did have an initial installation problem, one advanced feature wouldn't start up-but Bitdefender support suggested re-install and that fixed it. I love the features and performance is outstanding. I don't sit here frustrated waiting for apps to open and virus scans are even multiples faster than my previous products. I never was hacked or infected using the previous product but performance had gone to hell and it was time for a change. I am beyond just satisfied with this product."
Keven Huner,1,1,"If you buy this, good luck cancelling their auto renew feature.  In my opinion, very deceptive practices.  The software works fine, but try to get something done with customer support.  Ended up at a call center in India and put on hold for about 10 minutes while they tried and figure out how to cancel the service."
Peter Mares,9,5,"I am delighted with the protection provided. I moved protection of my network to Bitdefender over a year ago, from Kaspersky because of the latter's Russian connection. Now into my second contract with Bitdefender and have no regrets. In that time, whilst there have been many blocked attacks, there has been no breach of service. Bitdefender fulfills its promises across the board. Thank you."
George L NZ,1,5,"I have this product on 11 PC's, laptops, tablets and phones (android) and it works great. The reports are handy to see what is happening and the utilities are brilliant. There has been no noticeable degradation in performance of any of the devices it is installed on, and it has prevented numerous attacks on our devices.The after sales service is very good and the professionalism of the staff is outstanding. I recommend this product whole heartedly"
Frank D,2,5,"The products are easy tot install, easy to upgrade, easy to work with. I am into IT since 1982 and have worked with, as well professionally as personally, with several antivirus/security products. Bitdefender has a low footprint (does not take away much memory), works fast and reliably (I have not had even 1 issue compromising my IT products). I had 2 cases with questions, and they were answered the same day, followed up quickly, and solved quickly."
Michael Dunbar,1,5,"My computer has been running trouble-free for two or more years with Bitdefender anti-virus software. Communication is immediate when a virus/malware/other threat is ""caught"" and asking for assistance is always easy, prompt and efficiently handled."
The Ghost of Tarpot Hill,3,5,
Tom McArdle,1,5,Had an issue regarding accessing my firewall settings. Received a prompt and detailed course of action which eliminated the problem.
Muhammad Basem Aljisr,1,5,Reliable after-sales services. Problem resolution steps are always very clear and never fail.
Jan,3,5,I have found that Bitedfender Total Security has bailed me out of several problems. It is a top notch program and when it says Total Security it is Total Security. I like the fact that it also has Web Cam Protection. You can't go wrong and the customer service is one of the best.
Philip,18,5,I have been using Bitdefender for years & years. Always on 100% protection with no fuss and no loss of resources. 100% happy. Buy it you wont be disappointed.
Rewa,8,4,"Best antivirus I've ever tried. Easy to install, easy to use, a lot of features. But, recently, a small bug or virus got in my system and change my main font with a font that can't read, is everywhere. The antivirus didn't spot that."
Vanderdi Gustav,1,5,Easy to installEasy to use Good protection
Ben,1,5,The very best total security for your device
Terry Barlow,1,5,"I've used Bitdefender for many years. They continue to improve their products, protection and customer support. It's a very good price too."
Ilgıt Yıldırım,1,5,Title says it all! It is the best protection as software out there! Using Bitdefender for years now and I have tried many others before I settled with it. I have never looked back!
Owen Bytheway.,9,5,"Great product, great price, great support."
Ajay,1,5,The best reliable total protection solution available in the market today for my PCs
Leftwolf1933mhc,1,5,"Price is good.Customer service is great.Bitdefender is very fast. Bitdefender catches ALL attempts to hack me.I think I have only needed to call customer service twice I think, for about a year now."
Neil,4,5,"Bitdefender is highly rated and performs well in my experience.  Best of all, when it identified a problem, I was able to immediately reach customer support, get clear instructions for providing them with the needed details, and then get clear instructions from them about how to delete the offending software."
SHAHID LATIF,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender Total Security for many years now. It has lived par standard with me. It offers everything one would expect it to.
PHILIPS NORTH AMERICA,3,5,"Best protection suites on the planet!I've been a Bitdefender subscriber for years...began with Internet Security, upgraded to Total Security a few years ago.  It protects me from all threats including ransomware without being intrusive or slowing down my computer. And the price is very reasonable!"
Wade Williamston Sr,1,5,"Bitdefender gets my 5 stars and I'd give them 10 if I could. Bitdefender software is the best. Their Total Security software provides everything I need in security software. Coupled with their VPN software/service, I am covered. If you're not using Bitdefender products you are at risk of harm to your computer or other devices. You are also not allowing your system to operate at it's best capacity. Bitdefender uses less system resources and that is paramount! Get your system up to specs and speed with Bitdefender products!!!"
Bob Rose BeBe Taylor,1,5,"Great products, they run efficiently, protect my machines and my data at a fair price.  Service that accompanies the products is excellent."
MrRecen,3,5,Bitdefender is very user friendly and the support desk is more than friendly in their approach. I actually recommended this program to 8 of my friends and will continue to do so if bitdefender continues to exceed expectations.
Simon Bes,3,5,"Customer service is excellent, the product itself is brilliant too - I've had no issues since I've used their products for over 10 years now."
Robin Reynolds,3,5,An excellent product.   Customer care is very good with a refreshing personal touch that makes one feel they value you.
Stoic Graphic,6,5,Bitdefender seems like the go-to for anti-virus for the Mac! Doesn't interfere with processes and doesn't slow down my Mac when its in use. They also have great customer support! Thanks!
Pool Romshat,1,5,This is a very good product.  It's easy to use. I never have problem with computer virus since I use Bitdefender. And I will recommend to my friends.
Terry O Callaghan,24,1,"Rubbish customer care..have sent several email , yet to receive a reply"
Paul Bovingdon,4,5,"Have used 2 other security systems in the past and am impressed how much more comprehensive Bitdefender is.  The interface is easy to use, customer service is first class, the annual subscription cost is very reasonable.  I feel confident that Bitdefender can keep my laptop secure."
Brian Hall,1,5,"I have been using BitDefender since early 2000 and it has been my go-to ever since. I got tired of the other not getting all the threats before causing issues, or eating up my CPU cycles or memory. Bitdefender does better than the competition in keeping my system clean on a much smaller footprint. I can't recommend them enough."
Frank H Smith,4,5,"The best product to maximize your dollar. It performs seamlessly, has many practical features and does its job without slowing down the computer. Highly recommend."
Davide,2,5,Outstanding customers care.Best software out there.
Paul F,3,5,"Excellent reviews, Quality product, easy to use, great customer service. I have used BitDefender  for a few years and never had an issue. I regularly recommend  Total Security to friends and family."
Stephen Rybacki,2,5,"Since I've discovered BitDefender, my online world has been safe and secure without having to sacrifice performance.  Their suite of protection mechanisms is updated daily, and easy to use while providing all you need to protect your deive at a bargain price I might add.  Personally, I have a Box 2 device which is my home router and it provides BitDefender Security Suite 2019 to as many devices as I have PLUS keeping my IoT safe and secure."
Douglas Alexander,1,5,
Bharath,1,5,
Stewart Warrender,5,5,"Bitdefender are always quick to respond when contacted with questions and requests for help, the assistance is spot on. Can't beat the customer service and satisfaction to that degree."
Roko,1,5,Best antivirus and security! love all Bitdefender product
Robert Bigue,1,3,"I especially like to use the Bitdefender VPN. As for Bitdefender Total Security it is very efficient. It blocks harmful applications that want to install anonymously. One drawback, I don't like the way Safe Pay works. I have to write my login informations every time. It doesn't want to remember my login infos. Also, I can't make a (print screen) of my transactions. And I don't need protection for 5 devices, 3 would be enough for me. So I pay more because protection for 3 devices isn't offered. Overall, I think that Bitdefender Total Security is still worth it."
ghassan kazoun,2,5,"In an online world of everyday threats, this is my bodyguard and real defender."
Bob Reidy,2,5,My Antivirus plus is the best product I have ever used and the support very quick.
Mart Muru,2,5,
Marko Rukavina,1,5,"extremely easy and reliable program, team support at the highest level"
customer,4,1,"Worst customer care.I received an email for reduced renewal, which I paid for 7 days from my expiry date. On my expiry date I was charged again but with the original non reduced price. SO I paid for two overlapping one year worth of subscription. Now, they are offering to merge them to an 18 months subscription.Do not enable auto renewal or you will end up stuck like me.Update:I called Bitdefender customer service as well yesterday and asked for a refund for the second payment. Following the above review and the phone call, I received an email today saying I will be refunded for the second payment that was unwillingly taken. No one should go through such a hassle and waste of time.Just to respond to Bitdefender reply to this review, money being taken twice and being justified as auto renewal. So why was I sent offers for reduced renewal then?Your customer support proposed initial solution was to merge both payments and get a 18 months worth instead of the 24 months I unwillingly paid for. Is that fair?"
Bishram Dhanlalsingh,1,5,"Tried the trial(6 months), time was up, didn't want to lose solid and simplified protection, so opted for a subscription/purchase. Very satisfied, no regrets."
Josh Muir,2,3,"- On initial install software could not connect to their servers to verify my account (and purchase). Fixed by contacting support, who told me to restart.- They state that you get a VPN with the ""Total security"" but its not made clear that is heavily metered (Although they do state you c an separately purchase the ""Premium"" VPN- Other than that, the Software is great and has a lot of features I wasn't originally aware of, but welcomed. The AntiTheft feature is pretty good, but has a tendency to not detect my phone."
Mariana Oliveira,1,5,"I had an Addware problem. Bitdefender program didn't manage to find it, but by sending an email to their support center they studied the addware and gave me a guide on how to remove it. It greatly exceeded my expectations for the anti virus. Definitely a program worth paying for, and it's no wonder it's rated as the choice of the year."
Jorge da Fonseca,3,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for a few years now, and I find it to be an extremely powerful , yet light on resources anti virus & cyber security tool, with great features & fantastic after sales service  and customer care. Highly recommended."
Mike,7,5,"Great service, easy to get support and a very versatile product. Sales team very supportive and gave me a great price for my family. Wanted a 15 pack family pack and got unlimited installs. What more can you want. A great price as well."
Johannes Kip,2,5,"Fair priced, very effective protection. Good customer service. What else does one want?"
ETIENNNE DIERICK,13,5,A super protection and great online assistance
Takis,4,5,Exceptional and fast support.The instructions were Clear and Effective.
EJ,1,5,
George Gilchrist,3,2,"Their customer support is the worst I have experienced in 20 years.They send many ""Thank you for your patience..."" emails in response to a concern, then never answer the question. Renewing your subscription is a slow trip through total incompetence.They suggest you renew early to save money, so you go ahead and click, and every page which opens has a different price.So you renew anyhow, they send you a confirmation, and you think,""OK, that's done for a year.""Then something pops up telling you to install the app and they will help you set it up. But you already have the app running, for the last two years. Then they send you another renewal notice...Later, you get a message saying your subscription will expire in three days, but it has only been a month since you renewed for a year.If they can't keep track of their accounts, can't respond to customers' concerns, can't provide a smooth purchase/renewal experience, I wonder if they are really checking for malware, or just harvesting information. Bitdefender slows the computer right down when it is booted first thing in the AM."
James Nairn .,2,5,"When things go wrong , you can totally rely on Bitdefender to be there for you ."
Anon,6,5,I don't usually do this kind of review and I certainly don't give out 5 stars very regularly. Bitdefender is the exception to that rule. I had a small technical problem which I could not have fixed on my own. No amount of written instruction would have helped. On two occasions over three days my computer was placed under remote control and thanks to the patience of those i dealt with i am - at this time - a very happy customer. I have been a customer for three years and this was my first contact with anyone.
Pete,1,5,To all my Mac buddies... BitDefender is the AV and VPN solution for you and your devices. I'm protecting my MBP and iPhones seamlessly and efficiently. Also more than one device for a reasonable annual subscription. I had to connect/chat with support for a licensing activation and the support engineer was efficient and fast. Thank you BitDefender I highly recommend your products.
Karen Strange,1,1,"This product looks good until you have a virus or an issue that cannot be decontaminated or removed.Their support is a joke.  After many many calls and emails, still was told they would get to it. I finally went to Malawarebytes which is only product Apple recommends. They immediately got on it, told me what to do and how to resolve the issue and I was done, for free and in less than 12 hours.Bitdefender, still just sent me an email saying they are working on my case and will be back with me soon, it has been over 3 weeks since the problem had started. If I had waited for Bitdefender, I would still not be able to use my computer. I would never recommend Bitdefender."
Peter,3,5,"I have tried many other products that claim to be the best. Bitdefender is truly that company, their antivirus program is the best, it has the best features, it is easy to learn and use, it is well thought out in its features and it works seamlessly with my computer! It has virtually no impact on my memory and it runs very quickly and very accurately. I love the many features, one in particular is Bitdefender wallet. How it works is faultless, it only needs a profile and then it follows you as you go to the different websites and saves the logins, very cool indeed! The hidden surprise was when I had an issue and contacted the Customer Care Department, FANTASTIC is how I describe how Bitdefender handling of my issue. Professional, helpful, and they listened and understood my issue; they are professional, friendly, helpful, and are committed to the Customer not policy! I recommend Bitdefender 100% you will not be sorry, truly Bitdefender is in a class all by its self!! Thank you folks, I am one completely satisfied Customer. I would like very much to thank my contact from Customer Care, her name is Alina, she was a wonderful person and completely professional! Alina is a great credit to Bitdefender and I am so thankful to have worked with Alina!!! Bitdefender I would kindly ask that Alina be recognized for her talents, professionalism, and for being the reason I wrote this review! I hope nothing but the very best for you Alina and tremendous success to Bitdefender! I had a wonderful Customer Care experience, thank you!!!"
Keran,2,1,"Appalling customer service. Bought bit defender product on 17 March and when I tried to install it, it failed due to insufficient spec on my laptop. When I asked for refund, got a response to contact bit defender direct but without any contact information and they closed the request. I've emailed and called repeatedly and now 6 weeks later I'm still waiting for the non-installed product to be refunded. Being told it will be elevated each time and having to call repeatedly is appalling."
Courtney MacPherson,2,5,"Great program, .. thanks"
Desiree R.,1,5,"I’ve been having issues and they’re customer service has gone above and begonia helping. They’re actually one of the very few companies that I would take the time to write about. Simply because they’ve been just great, helpful, understanding, their technical knowledge surpasses so many other companies. They are so patient, which was surprising, especially being a mom always on the go and not always knowing where everything is. Always polite, to the point and all around excellent!!!"
Elisa Gonzalez,1,5,I have had Bitdefender for several years now.  The product is excellent.  The cost is reasonable with opportunities to renew for less.  Customer service is outstanding.
Kousein,2,5,Light and awesome.I tried the program with the trial and i am now a subscriber. It does what it is supposed to and with a fair price for my wallet.My experience with their support team was also great and that is another plus from me.Totally recommended.
NG,4,1,"Bitdefender packages VPN software with their antivirus software. If you have any kind of Parental Control on your home router (like Disney Circle or NetGear Parental Control) then the VPN enables anybody to completely bypass this!  The worst thing is, Bitdefender does not give you the option to uninstall the VPN software. When I emailed them about this, they very rudely said no, they have no plans to give users the choice to uninstall the VPN. One of the support people even told me ""You should learn how to control your children. This is a disciplining issue, not a software issue"". I was shocked. So clearly, parental control software means nothing to the people at BitDefenderAnyway, bottom like is - Bitdefender is no good if you want to use router based parental controls. You r children will be able to access anything on the internet at any time they want.Also, their support is atrocious. Avoid this company at all costs."
Chris,2,5,"I have had Bitdefender protect my online security for a fair few years, and plan to be with them for many more."
James C Huddleston,3,5,"After Geek Squad and Kaspersky, Bitdefender was a beacon of bright light.  They follow up promptly and if I was slow getting back to them, they would re-contact me and ask 'where is your data'?  You cannot beat that service."
Rizgar Mohammed,1,5,"As i am using Bitdefender total security more than three years on more than one of my computers devices, I found this program the most effective antivirus program that helped to keep my computers safe. Thanks Bitdefender for this amazing antivirus!"
NickTheGreek,1,5,Ranking only when you start using BitDefender you realize their #1 ranking is not a hyper but absolutely fair
Jackie Mcilroy,1,5,I feel safe with bit defender on my phone and computer
Don Mills,1,5,Bitdefender gives the ultimate protection for secure situations. For banking vitual keyboard gives me protection from keyloggers and vpn then encrypts the path out of my pc.
Robert,2,5,i used this product first in my WINDOWS machine since i changed for MAC even if their OS is most secure i stay with Bitdefender.Just one restriction the VPN is  often disconnecting alone.
Eveline,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for several years now, and I'm very happy with it. It works, it protects my computer from viruses and other attacks, and with the family account I can also add my family's computers to the protection!"
Norman Heaps,1,5,Bitdefender immediately solved a problem.
Michael Weigel,4,5,"Bitdefender simply does the job. I changed to Bitdefender when another product let me down and my windows build was ruined by a virus. I did a lot of research on Google before I bought this product. It has not let me down. I use the Internet Security version and it is great. It has an interface that even a 76 year old male can understand. Yes I am old. When I developed a problem with Bitdefender causing slow bootup, they sent me software so that they could fix it remotely. They did so and I am happy about it. I am always careful not to click on unknown links. But, Bitdefender tells me when I am trying to go to a dangerous web site I clicked from Google. This kind of looking ahead is invaluable to me. It has kept my computer clean for years now. No, I own no stock in Bitdefender and only am prejudiced because the technician who helped me with the slow bootup was so kind to me. I am a little old and slow. She was very patient."
Joseph Smith,2,5,"Excellent, second to none.  Bitdefender is a big company but they are approachable on a personal 1:1 basis and support you with your issues"
JAMES P PATERSON,12,5,"I had a problem where my Mac slowed down and the only way it could be sorted was by switching off the scanner.  I contacted Bitdefender and following their suggestions by email that we tried and failed, a remote session was set up and now everything is back to normal.  The team behind the product are excellent and very, very helpful."
Marc Mannish,1,5,"With the low impact on cpu usage, the user friendly interface and knowledgable customer service, Bitdefender is one I will keep using."
Mr Seymour,2,1,They may have top notch software but beware they use a questionable outfit called 2checkout.com as a re-seller to process your credit card payment.On a £35 transaction they requested that I provide a passport/Driving licence and a copy of my credit card payment.They have 88% bad reviews on Trust pilot.Safe to say that I cancelled my order .
Anna Lowery,1,5,"My husband has had Bitdefender for over a year & he was very pleased with it, which is mainly why I decided to purchase it.  Since I am not tech savvy, I also signed up for Bitdefender to take care of setting up their program/product in my computer - I called them at the phone number given & they took care of everything!  GREAT customer service & GREAT product - they were very courteous & professional, and I was very happy I purchased this product!"
Claus,5,4,Actually happy with everything EXCEPT when i whitelist something bitdefender still block and/or delete it. It annoyed me so much that i have now unsubscribed and will not be using it again.
Bianca Balu,2,5,"Best antivirus , and not only, that I have had so far. Very happy with the purchase. Reasonably priced as well."
Mostafa TR,2,5,An amazing Antivirus with a super kind and fast support service.I think this is the only antivirus which can detect even so smart trojans like Neshta which bothered me so much.
J.F. Horne,1,5,Bitdefender is a highly rated product one reason. It works effectively. I have used it for years and recommend it unreservedly.
Kim Curzon,31,5,Very good product with excellent customer service.
Ian Boothby,19,5,"Great protection not only when surfing, but also checks emails thoroughly.  I had a query and their customer service was excellent, unlike others who I've used.  Always in the top 3 for both detection and low false-positives in real-world tests by independent testers. Runs with minimal CPU and RAM requirements too.  No constant ""nag"" screens and simple to set up and use for non-techies!"
RUSI PAVRI,1,5,
Brandon,2,5,"It's hard to rate a product that protects you. How do you know it protected you? Well the review sites show that it protects very well and I find that it impacts my computer use very little, which is key. Uses 400mb of memory and doesn't effect file transfer speeds or app startup times. 5/5"
Robert Firestone,1,5,It is the best firewall and it works without constant (actually almost no personal effort is required) 'tweaking'.
Russ Alderman,1,5,"I hardly ever write product reviews, but in the customer care/support of my Bitdefender Box 2 I must make an exception.  I was having extreme difficulty installing the annual software update as the program kept giving me an error as it attempted to uninstall the prior software.  I contacted the BD team and they responded promptly.  They gave me some suggestions to circumvent my difficulty, however I was extremely reluctant to use the “terminal” program.  Rapidly they set up a telephone appointment time and a couple of days later, at the scheduled time I was contacted.  The gentleman that I worked with, Adrian Munteanu, was both professional and extremely competent.  He went into my mac and corrected the problems, and even pointed out a couple of programs that were known problems, and with my consent he deleted those as well.  All I can say is Bitdefender Box, job well done.  I’ll be staying with their quality product and exceptional customer services.  Thank you.Russ Alderman"
Viktor,1,5,"Excellent brand. Offers solution for home users and companies as well (from small to enterprise size). I have many years experience with them in home category. They are keep revising and developing their products and features offered with them. This ensures that their products are efficient tool against the risks we are facing in the today's digital world and this is how they can keep their leader position in this field. With the discounts often offered by them you can get the most effective solution with the best price/value ratio. Also in case you need any help, or have suggestion, you can contact their online support via chat interface 24/7."
MR C DWYER,51,5,"After using Avast Premier for two years, I decided to try Bitdefender, as they were cheaper than renewing Avast !!There is absolutely no slowing down of my laptop in comparison, and when I contacted the customer services regarding an upgrade, I was looked after by an excellent, knowledgeable agent who solved the issue I was concerned about.I have no reservations in highly recommending this company"
Jsjwbsb Bsbshsbsh,1,5,"*bitdefender for Android*Notification and viruses: sends you notifications instantly about ad-ware, dangerous websites, and malware/viruses.features: It has some really good like app lock, phone lock, locate your phone, takes a picture if someone gets your password wrong at least 3-5 times, and my favorite which is the account breach scan, you put your account in, you get a notification, get the code, put it in and then it scans your account if you have been in a breach. when I did this for the first time I had around 5 different data breaches and changed my password on all. customer service: is really good, they tell you what to do for really confusing situations and respond very quick.Price: this is a very good antivirus and doesn't cost that much like other antiviruses."
Tim,1,3,"The full antivirus suite was freezing up quite often. I experienced this several times during my 30 day trial period. I was not very pleased with the fact the 2019 version would not cover my 2 older laptops which run windows 7. I would have to run a separate version of Bitdefender for Windows 7 & 8 and no guarantee of protection. We have our reasons for keeping 2 Windows 7 devices up and running.I did work with online support, ....Once. I wasn't very elated with the help I received. All in all, I don't see the hype of the product. I would hate to invest the money into the WiFi security and be disappointed; only then having to fool with the trouble of shipping equipment back!Mediocre at best. I would have to be convinced, otherwise."
Brian,3,5,Great protection app with excellent customer support
Natoya Rose,1,4,"While I really do like this programme and its features - it also allows me to stop my elderly mother getting into trouble on the internet - the emails I continue to receive, telling me my subscription is about to expire, even though I have renewed it are more than annoying. I can only wonder how many people end up buying more than one subscription simply because of these emails. I also finding the pricing on the product is deceptive. It does not cost the stated amount when one does renew. I can only wonder why these cost disparities exist. If you want a truly excellent programme then I have no trouble recommending Bitdefender, but be you will have to have a tolerance for the 'low tech' behind the scenes email thingy."
Wayne Hewlett,1,5,There's a reason why it tops the antivirus charts year on year...because  it's  unequivocally the best.
Dennis Midskov Stenderup,47,5,
Lilie Eikenberry,1,5,I have found Bitdefender to work better than other similar products with great customer service if you have questions.
Nathan Quinn,2,5,Nice and easy to use good cover and good customer support would recommend to anyone wanting peace of mind.
Ben Kuijers,3,1,"I get an email staying that my account will be charged the maximum price for autorenewal, when I try cancel the price is again offered at 35% off. Really glad I caught the email before being charged such a scummy bussiness practice definately not renewing my subscription!"
scottyscouse,10,5,Everything you would want from a security program without slowing the computer down.
Mario Lugo,1,5,"It is very easy to install, use, update and when I needed support from the technical team, was an excellent service."
Neeraj Dherwani,1,5,Best software not slowing the computer. Latest updates for securing the OS and great customer support.
Miranda Matthews,4,1,"Purchased this product earlier this year thinking it will help with protecting my computer while I'm in my final year at Uni.Tried to use PDFs on my portfolio and low and behold, was unable to use them.  Couldn't open them.  The programs didn't want to open.  Nearly falied submission of my portfolio.  I had to deactivate all the protection elements to the product so that I could work on PDFs.  When I asked for a refund I was told that I couldn't apply for one as I was over the 30 day limit.  If I had known that it was this awful, I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place.  Was told by customer service (continually) that I should allow them acccess to my computer so they could rectify the problem.  The answer is short... NO!!If you're smart, don't do it to yourself.  Stay clear.  Especially if you have some really important work to do which involves looking at PDFs."
eden chee,1,5,I have used few brands of antivirus software so far Bitdefender has fulfil my expectations. For so many years Bitdefender family is still my choice for all my PC protection.
Terry Curran,1,5,Bitdefenders 24 hour support gives a level of reassurance that I have never had before in internet security
Yannis,1,5,"Each one of the correspondents was more than efficient, polite, knowledgeable, willing to help me on my problem.Responding in the fastest time they could, coming back to my issue even when I was neglecting it because of other priorities, this Support Team is the best I encountered in my e-buying history.If anyone of you needs to be a member of the family of the best, he has to come to the BD family.Don't wait long!        :-D"
PJG56A,1,5,Good antivirus software with a small footprint
Bernadette Boyes,3,5,"An excellent product with an easily contactable, brilliant, prompt and personal customer service. I wish customer services were this good in other sectors."
Shaylen,1,5,Bitdefender's customer support team are very experienced in dealing with issues and it was really easy to resolve my specific issue thanks to them. Highly recommend Bitdefender's products
Scott C.,1,5,Great products and service!  Solid technical support staff with good followup!
Вадим Белкин,6,5,"I've had BD Total Security since June last year. I noticed that scans became faster, and BD processes occupy less space in RAM. Good job, BD, you're going in the right direction!"
Peter,2,1,"Completely dissatisfied ! ...because automatic renewal is the most expensive way, always retail list price for the product, almost double the price of the special offers. It is mentioned in light grey text in the renewal Email, very hard to recognize...the typical trick of small character terms&conditions.No sense of CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP and long term customer discount."
Chad Wek,1,5,If you're looking for a way to keep todays security threats at bay.  This product will do just that.  I have been using it for 3 years now and know that my devices are always protected.
Taco,1,5,Brilliant and top notch product i stand by and believe in bitdefender 100% but not just theirs high quality products but the great/amazing people that make up all of what is bitdefender.
Mark “L-iSkatenat” Farrugia,1,5,A very powerful yet simple antivirus protection service with great customer support.
Helen Driver,2,5,"Have and will continue to recommend to family and friends. Marvellous, can't beat that feeling of total protection and safety"
VALERA JUNIOR,1,5,good customer service
Gail,2,5,"On Thursday 2/28/19 I had the assistance of Samuel in the customer care dept assist me with adding the Anti Virus Plus program to another device and also uninstalling it from an older device.  Samuel was very pleasant and knowledgeable and it took no time at all to accomplish the task.  He took me step by step and made the add on so easy to do.  Thank you Samuel, they should give you a raise in pay"
Marcel Powolny,1,5,The best Internet security software I have ever tested.
Ruth Bowles,3,5,Bitdefender internet and total security products are brilliant and intelligent catching all sorts of Virus Malware and Spywares.
Rob van Wely,2,5,"Apparently perfect protection from any internet threat, very competent, rapid (and friendly!) customer service."
Bogdan STORM,2,5,"You don't know who you're dealing with until you contact them.I have nothing but good thoughts and words for Bitdefender products, support team and overall experience.Trust them and you won't regret it. Ever."
Tom Thebault,1,1,"I have no opinion of the product performance. However, it was installed on my company laptop by our company IT people back in December. I never so much as opened it up during this whole time, figuring it was simply doing its job etc.  Low and behold, Feb 20 I see a charge on my PERSONAL credit card for $76.48 from BitDefender.  At no time have i ever shared my card info with them or my employer and i use AVG free on my home computer.I have initiated a refund request without issue, although no one there could tell me how this was possible. Obviously my card is now breached and being cancelled.  VERY DISTURBING"
Lesado Q,1,5,"Amazing antivirus,with simple to use features that cover every need.Also I had to contact customer support for a mistake I made during my payment and they resolved it instantly without asking silly questions like many other companies do when it comes to payments."
Barbara Freeman,1,5,"Your products work great I have been using them since 2013 I think, I have always had a great experience with bitdefender. The product is non-invasive and the customer service is great as well! In the beginning when I started using bitdefender it cost less than it does now for students, but it has had improvements over the years and the customer service has been expanded to chat as well which is great. The only thing that I wish that there was was the availability to find the phone number to call a little bit easier then having to Google the phone number for customer service as I did in the past. But I am glad that chat is available it's very efficient and I'm able to click on links when I need a link. This is better than Norton or McAfee Antivirus. I love you both and neither one has been as good as this. With security on this product is far better than anything out there without causing problems on my computers that is sold in United States. Keep up the great work! It is sad that the United States doesn't make something as great as you guys do."
GUY SUTTON,3,5,"Simply great value for money.Over the years I have used many different antivirus products and keep coming back to Bitdefender. I don't bother looking elsewhere anymore. The value for money, protection and customer service is fantastic and I can't recommend them enough."
Birgit Lønskov,16,5,"I should try to take a copy of a banksheet, but I could not gind out haw to do, so I got help from Bitdefender, snd do it was easy, thank yoü."
30lbThreadie,2,1,"This product caused so many sleepless nights as it was so unfriendly to use and kept on glugging my computer. Once my IT guy stopped it ....... everything worked again. Don't go near it. Even the automatic renewal was nearly double of what you could buy it for online, and I had to spend more money and ring them to cancel my renewal. Their practices should be illegal or probably are."
Saqib Rahman,1,4,"I've been using BitDefender for the past 6 years and I have to say this is by far the best Internet Security in the market. I've used competing products as well but they have trouble balancing between PC performance and efficiency. BitDefender has kept my PC free of viruses and other malware and also does tasks in the background that do not slow my PC down. I do not own a high end PC so with my configuration BitDefender has truly managed to surpass my expectations as far as Internet Security softwares are concerned. Only improvement I would like them to make is to offer free PC tune up services. otherwise, BitDefender is highly recommended by me."
Maxxiiboyy,2,1,"Real piece of trash software. Keeps you ""safe"" from safe programs. Keeps deleting and locking safe EXEs and folder. Would not recommend for anyone."
Saxnet,8,5,"Bitdefender is number one in many test, and have a very helpfull service. PC and Mac is also running very nice and smooth with this antivirus, and it have a nice price"
Victor Patterson,1,1,I just had to uninstall this. I had used the product before but got the 2019 version and it gave me constant problems. I couldn't even download attachments from my email. Waste of money. Totally disgusted with the product.
N. Pil.,1,2,"Customer support virtually does not exists. Reply time can be days.There are some features that are user unfriendly, like it is impossible to temporarily stop all protection modules with one click - you should do it module by module."
Abbas Aliakbari,1,5,I like bitdefender and it's great product.
Dom Williams,1,5,"Well, I have had BitDefender for 2 years but had no loyalty it, then I had a problem...well they were exceptional. Not only did they respond quickly but also with true kindness and concern, not the fabricated concern that companies try to fake. After we could not solve the problem at the 1st stage, the escalation was just as fast and caring. Turns out the problem was something I had unknowingly created, and with respect, they helped me correct a problem I had created.  Few companies care to help people more or less with something that is not their responsibility but they did. Not only do they have a lifelong customer but excited promoter."
Felipe Aires,2,5,They offer good services and excellent customer service.
Melisa,1,5,"This antivirus is great, since it does its job perfectly. Moreover, if you encounter a problem with it, Bitdefender's support team is very quick, responsive and helpful. Would recommend it 100%."
Mr CROSS,4,1,"On 17th January 2019 I went on Bitdefender website and paid £25 for Internet Security 2019 but it just would not download,I tried three times which proved unsuccessful,I then went on Amazon website and downloaded 2019 Kaspersky Internet Security which installed and activated perfectly - I then immediately went on BD website,selected Refund and stating it failed to download after three attempts  and so did not have it but downloaded Kaspersky without any problem and requested refund,had reply saying they had received payment and long ticket number but no mention of refund.A few days later I checked my statement and found they had taken another payment on the same day for £22.49and created a fake ID number,I contacted them again on website stating the had charged me twice for something I didn’t have and reminding them this was the second time of asking for refund and informing them I was giving them fourteen days for refunds to be made and failure todo so would mean me contacting fraud authorities the deadline being 5th February,all replies I get say thank you for your patience and long ticket numbers but refunds never mentioned. On 28th January I received email apologising for delays,to contact support team who would help install and set up their security, I replied referring them to my previous message- that I now had Kaspersky and deadline for refunds was 5th February as stated previously ,on 8th February I received email which for the first time mentioned refunds after three requests and three weeks i would be paid in 5-7business days ,this has now been paid. IF YOU SCROLL DOWN YOU WILL FIND LOTS MORE LIKE THIS,JUST BE AWARE BEFORE BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY"
Retired US Soldier,2,5,"Been using Bitdefender for the last three years and it clearly sets the bar.     It's ease of use and speed of use is truly remarkable.Prior to this I had used Kaspersky for many years, but Bitdefender is hands down a faster program, and much easier to use than Kaspersky, not to mention Bitdefender is the #1 rated AV product because it's very effective and much to the chagrin of virus and malware hackers, they seem to hate Bitdefender for a good reason, -it works as advertised-."
Sarah A,1,3,"Since I wrote the review below, Bitdefender has been in touch with me. They quickly dealt with my concerns and provided a full refund. I have, therefore, changed my overall rating and the review to reflect the company's pro-active move to put things right. I bought Bitdefender late last year as the most highly-rated anti-virus software on the market. I have had other brands before and they were fine, but the reviews for Bitdefender were so good, I thought I would switch. Big mistake. I found it so difficult and glitchy, all computer technology in the house was adversely affected. The printer wouldn't work, the email wouldn't work, the Wifi wouldn't work. And, even when we did manage to get online, access to Google was blocked.  I followed the 'how to' advice. I looked up forums and did everything by the book. But I could not get it to work. Bitdefender initially refused a refund. Apparently, it was outside their refund policy period. Rather than a refund, they wanted to give me more advice.  I'd rather stick pins in my eyes. But, as I say, after I wrote the review, Bitdefender recognised my difficulty and came forward with the offer of a refund."
Peter,1,5,"This is a great product.  You really don’t even know it’s working in the background.The program did not seem to slow down my system.  It has stopped a few virouses on my system and delt with them.  I feel very safe with Bitdefender.  The service department was a little hard to get a hold of.  It took me about a week to text with a person.  When I did connect, the gentleman was very kind and solved my problem in short order.  It took a reinstall to fix my issue."
Liam Sheridan,5,1,"Was up for a renewal for a VPN subscription.Their VPN is terrible so I tried to stop the auto-renewal. The link they send to stop the renewal requires a login that is different to your account, so I couldn't log in. I requested a ""forgotten password"" but that didn't work. I logged into my account and tried to chat to online support. No-one answered. I had to phone them. They told me they have cancelled my renewal but I still haven't received email confirmation.Another company that relies on customer apathy for revenues. They need to realise they have competition."
James Ross,2,1,"Here is an email I received from Bitdefender on January 24:Dear James Ross, Thank you for your patience.We hope this email finds you well. We wanted to let you know that your request, ticket no: 2018122417230002 is currently being reviewed and you will receive a response as soon as possible.Have a nice day!Best Regards,Bitdefender Customer Care Team They are now claiming to want to help me, yet apparently have no record of my issue and the multiple emails that I and my IT guy exchanged with them. Very unprofessional! If they are truly more interested in helping me than in protecting their reputation, they should know that I can be reached at my email address, an address they've had for quite some time.James Ross"
Jeremy Piper,8,5,"It works, it's not intrusive and it is reasonably priced."
Jeremie Filiatrault,3,5,"Very easy to use and has surpassed all my expectations of a great protection for my computers.  Cheap price and the service department is fast response at a request.  Easy to install and has all the bells and whistles that are missing from other software (Vipre, Norton, Mcafee, ect)"
PatrickOfLondon,37,5,"I find this product very good, very thorough, and definitely recommend it. I have tried others in the past, but came back to this one, and have stayed with it ever since."
John Rickett,3,5,Bitdefender Total Security gets excellent reviews and is competitively priced. I've used it on all our devices for three years without experiencing any security issues.
王,1,5,
Tom Smith,1,1,"I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I WAS ROBBED OF $22.95. THIS SECURITY IS THE WORSE PIECE OF JUNK THAT I EVER USED... I HAVE REMOVED IT FROM MY PC,AND I PAID $60.00 A YEAR FOR ESET SMART SECURITY PREMIUM..."
Joe,2,5,"Support was very easy to reach by phone. They helped me with a complex email hacking issue that my ISP and Apple support could not explain. Also referred me to a site that lists if my email was compromised on a hacked website. (It was.) Finally, gave me good advice as to how to handle the issue."
Anny uit S,3,5,Easy to install. User friendly & lots of interesting options. Excellent total security. Good technical support.
eshwar cherukuri,1,5,I've been using it for the past month so far I'm very much satisfied with the performance and its ability to keep my devices secure.
Eddy,19,2,"First year OK. Renewed for a second year (not auto renewal). I renewed it because they had a special offer even though I still had one month to run and they said subscription would start from renewal date, so far so good. Then I got a series of emails telling me that my subscription was about to expire, I kept replying that I have already renewed it. I kept checking that the subscription was live. Now I find that they have charged me for the extra ""install & set up multi-platform"" as well. I've asked for a refund as I didn't add this to my basket. I have not activated it. They are saying the 30 days is up and I can not cancel but they have set up a ""ticket"" for an enquiry. What's the chances of getting my money back folks given the problems some of you have had with this simple request.UPDATEI am waiting for the ticket number from you so can not supply yet. the order ID was 88389488.Further UPDATE 08/02/2019I contacted the checkout company in Holland who deducted the payment, they promptly replied that they had passed on my email to Bitdefender for a refund. A few days later I heard from Bitdefender who were sorry for the inconvenience and confusion and they have promised to refund the money back onto my card. I am very grateful to them. Just be very careful if you get a pop up screen with another product, that its not accidentally added to your invoice."
Jim Farwell,1,5,"Bitdefender provides excellent antivirus protection, an excellent firewall, great internet security, excellent instant pop-up notifications when I try to access what may be a dangerous web-site.  Best of all, Bitdefender's technical support has been outstanding, with an obviously well-prepared technician willing to spend as much time as we needed to correct the effects of my mistake.  I have been a customer for three years now, and I will continue to use their software."
Hector,9,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for around 4 years now, I absolutely love this antivirus, it is easy to use, quite intuitive actually. It doesn't slowdown my PC like others did and the price for 3 devices / year is quite good. I would recommend this product to anybody who want to be safe and simply forget about dealing with the antivirus ever again."
Roger Powell,4,5,I have been using Bitdefender for a few years now. Seems rock-solid with minimum set-up time. I used ZoneAlarm earlier but it was expensive and seemed to required more configuration.
Michael R,1,5,"For the average user the application(s) work right out of he box and require minimal set up time. For others there is a treasure trove of things to work with.  If for some reason things are not work properly there is a very knowledge support staff available 365 /24. I have, on occasion, needed some assistance and BitDefender support team has been available by chat, email and by voice. They have been great to work with. I have computers and Android devices secured by them. They are always polite and they  make sure to understand the problem, do their best to replicate it and let you know how to fix it.I think you will find that this company provides a whole lot of products that you can set and forget as it protects you, your data and machines. I have used a couple of other companies before finding Bitdefender and all of them did not have the professionalism, compassion and want to provide you with the best experience possible"
Clay,1,5,
Shawn,1,4,"Bitdefender had to be contacted multiple time before the issue with not being able to get it to install was resolved. It took way too much effort to get finally get the program to run. Found out after multiple calls/emails that the ""access code/number"" they gave me was intended for an IBM type machine and would not work on a Mac."
Deborah,1,3,"I changed my rating & added 2 star. After posting to Trustpilot, Bitdefender contacted me right away. They apologized and promised my refund within 5-7 days. I accepted their explanation and I did receive my refund as promised.First post:I decided not to use the product & have been asking for a refund for over 3 months. I have had one automated email stating they received my request and was reviewing. I’ve not been able to get a response to my numerous emails since nor have I received the credit I requested. Really, really disappointed in the company and their lack of customer service.Reply:The open ticket number I was given is: 2018102120330003.I really, truly appreciate your response.Thank you,Deborah"
STOYAN,2,5,Reliable!Works fine with Win 10.
Beatrix Sontag,1,5,"It is the best program out there, the one you can rely on.It offers tons of features and you don't have to worry about anything."
Jorge,2,4,"I have used this antivirus for years. I had a small issue with a new PC and the first experience with technical service was not very good, but after letting them know, they contacted me back ( a different person ) and solved the problem"
Don Wallis,2,5,"I have been using computers in my home and business since the very first machines were introduced in the early eighties. Of course, in those days there was no cyber-crime directed at home users of personal computers. It didn't take long for the bad guys to come out of the woodwork, and I soon began to use antivirus software. I have used several starting with software developed here in Australia. After trying several Internet security solutions over the years, I have come to rely upon Bitdefender for many years now. The thing I like the best is that it sits in the background, uses a modest amount of my computer's processing power and has allowed me to discontinue using multiple anti-malware/spyware programs to feel secure. With Bitdefender combined with a common-sense wariness of phishing or malware attempts through email or pop-up screens or fake telephone calls from scammers, I feel safe."
Andrei Liulin,2,5,Bitdefender makes AV programs I can rely on!
Zoran,1,5,"1. Small, unvisible yet very strong and efficient security solution2. Gives You the opportunity to completely control the way they secure Your system3. Excellent customer support4. Favorable opportunities to buy this guardian of Your system."
BLN,2,5,14+ years of total satisfaction with as a Bitdefender customer. Enough said.
Shubham,13,5,Great antivirus.
William Brown,1,5,Great software and excellent customer support when needed.  The support people are very helpful in solving any issue that you may have.  I have used Bitdefender for several years now and intend on doing so.
Fredrik,18,2,I have been using BD for some years now. As I have not experienced many problems I assume its doing what its suppose to do. On the other hand other AV I had before BD too provided problem free experience so I can not say if it is something very exceptional with BD.However those few times there were issues with BD the support provided was not helpful or useful and finally I was even instructed to re-instal BD. In one case I reinstalled BD but it didn't help. Right now there is a problem with the BD's free VPN. It is not working and I dont have the time to exchange many emails w/o results.
Bala,1,1,I have 3 year subscription. Yesterday my computer was hacked and bitdefender is sitting as lame duck.  Tried contacting the customer support. They got all the information about the hack and closed the chat. Is there any worst software available in the market than bitdefender?
Agnieszka Szymanska,1,1,"Do not buy its product if you like good, proffesional support.  Bitdefender has become one of those companies you don't want to do business with. Two tickets waiting for response from 2 weeks: Missing code after prepaid for Antyvirus Plus 2019.  Ticket number: 2019010913350003  And now I just want my refundation, nothing else:  Ticket number:  2019011113340005Could you answer me?"
Niklas,15,1,"Their AV product for macOS is unacceptable. Their support seems to think all organisations are a few users and does not grasp the concept of 2000+ clients that have issues. Log gathering requires extra tools (developer tools) to be installed. Its a ugly homebrew product that has no place in enterprise!Update: As per bitdefenders reply, there are no specific case, this opinion is based on my experience with the product. You have a good support team that does what it can with an substandard product."
Erwin Lorenzen,15,5,I have experienced very fine support from the support team.
Terry Sharp  (Newburgh Aberdeenshire),7,5,Excellent Antivirus Protection with first class backup customer service. Wouldn't use anything else.
JT,1,5,"After years of using free protection apps, and still experiencing the occasional nasty, I decided to try find out what a paid for service would do for me. So far very impressed and feel so much more secure with very effective real-time protection from the bad guys out there."
Richard John Biddlecombe,20,5,Superb 'Total Security' programme backed up by excellent technical help on the rare occasions it might be needed.Have used for several years now and will continue to do so.
Stanisław Stawecki,1,1,"Big Nope! Just bought last week a new Bitdefender Antyvirus 2019. Missing code, so I'm waiting 7 days for my answer from support- they do not know what's going on. No code, no money, no antyvirus :)"
Dorin,3,5,The best! Number 1!
Jamie Williamson,2,5,"I recently had someone try to remote access my comp. Bitdefender was on it! The log was easy to read showed exactly when it happened (I was not at home), how often, where it was coming form, what they were trying to do. Support reached out to me via email and made sure my comp was safe!"
Patrick Calija,6,1,"I have been working with Bitdefender for some time now, it causes a lot of PC slowdowns if it needs to be updated (just shuts internet traffic down basically), also kicks you off of wifi networks, acts as a proxy between you and websites, basically sniffs your data to sell you more useless products etc. NOT WHAT I WAS USED TO GET FROM BITDEFENDER. I have had better and worse experiences. The Big issue is the renewals. I have worked for another AV company in the past in the customer support, so I know how things work. I ordered for 29 USD in 2018, it was supposed to renew now in 2019 for over 90 USD which is crazy expensive for these products, so I wanted to cancel the renewal. What happened is, that I contacted Bitdefender 3 or 4 times in the past 3 months, to cancel renewals (tried from the account before). I was told by Chat agents that I will be contacted by the sales department etc. even after I explicitly said I WANT TO CANCEL RENEWALS; NO OTHER ALTERNATIVES, NO DISCOUNTS, JUST CANCEL (I was never contacted) and the renewal reminders kept on coming. Now, after 3 months, they tried to charge me the 90+ USD, they tried yesterday, and again today. I can not believe that this is their MO, I now emailed Avangate (their payment provider) to stop the charges...UPDATE:I started a chat with the topic of cancelation, I waited for 45 minutes and no one attended, then I contacted from another IP address with the topic ""I want to buy"" and got a response in less than 10 seconds. only for the agent to blow me off with a canned response, saying they will contact me.,... AGAIN... the most unprofessional service ever.THEY JUST LEFT THE CHAT..."
Shantha Weerakoon,1,5,Didn't know how to reinstall Bitdefender after reinstallation of  Windows 10 due to a crash. Chatted with the customer care and they advised me how to do it in a very helpful and friendly manner.
Stephan Klochkov,1,5,"Fast and simple. It doesn't require constant supervision, it doesn't break apps or games but at the same time intercepts anything suspicious. Protects you while you browse the internet, protects your personal data, keeps all transactions secure (really important). Also has some nice features that help to keep your system healthy.Smart, vigilant and easy to use."
John,1,1,"Having read good reviews for them,I ordered online, a 3-year subscription to Bitdefender Internet Security Suite. They promptly debited the amount due from my bank account. However,when  I tried to create a Bitdefender account, in order to activate my product, all I got was an error report..multiple times. I couldn't even create the account. Of course, I emailed them with my complaint.That was 19 days ago. All I've got from Bitdefender since then is one email giving me some ticket number, and another email thanking me for my patience... That's it.. All further emails from me to them have been ignored. I have now raised a Mastercard Customer Dispute complaint, in order to get my money returned. I have also complained to the Bitdefender billing agency (2checkout.com). In fact, the billing agency were very polite and helpful. As for Bitdefender, I wouldn't touch them again with a barge pole. You have been warned. A very slippery company.."
SS,12,1,"This product will set itself up as a proxy between any websites you connect to and your browser, i.e, a classic man in the middle attack.This is disgusting, and not what a ""antivirus"" or ""security"" company should do, as it achieves the opposite."
dab,1,4,"Honestly, If there weren't malware notifications i would've rated five stars."
Andrew,1,1,"Terrible support and failing product. After waiting on the phone for 45 minutes on iOS Mobile Security, The agent didn't understand what I was talking about or find a solution for the product. He further escalated the ticket to tier 2 support. I got an incorrect solution (which if the tier 1 tech documented it properly they would have maybe understood, good job Bitdefender for outsourcing outside the US for L2 English speakers) No response to tickets as they are sent back through a general email. I find that unacceptable as a best business practice. After getting anti-theft enabled correctly, the features were only accessible through Bitdefender central on my iPhone. Anti-theft features did not work from the web. Lots of bugs in the iOS mobile security product. The chat was also unsuccessful in solving this issue. Again escalated it. I gave up on their support.  I finally got it to work myself after much reading, workarounds, software uninstalls, and  phone resets. This took several days of my time. Unacceptable. Also If you are considering total Internet Security option, The new PC upgrade eats huge amounts of RAM. If you are looking for a premium security product get Norton.Update : Until I emailed Bitdefender and told them I voiced my opinion on this forum did I get a response for support."
Herman Van Cauwelaert,4,5,"Very good product, very good support"
victor cruz,1,5,The services and the efficient way to handle virus blockage I haven't had in previous years from other sources
Konstantinos,3,5,Responsive Customer Support. Working flawlessly
Bob Wineland,1,5,"I have used many Antivirus companies who claim to be superior to any other. Avast was the last one i had the unfortunate experience of paying for. This software was so bad that i received a BSOD after a complete system scan. I believe that they were either directly, or indirectly, responsible for the death of my hard drive."
Zoltan Szekely,1,5,"Above the security, they do have a very strong support, which is able to solve your issue within a minute. Polite & professional, I am highly satisfied."
Khalil Badi,1,5,"The best Total Security i have ever seen.Easy to use.Completely automatic with autopilot.You don't have to be destrubed with warning mesages, or scanning windows every time he detects threads...I do not regret to buy it.I'm very glad to have such complete security.I also can scan my son's computer, even if he so far from home.Am not paid to say this. It worth to be tried. And am sure you will love itThe best app. With the lowest cost and paid price"
Mansur,1,1,"Bought Bitdefender. Activation email never came. Tried logging into Bitdefender Central. The screen came up with ""Internal Server Error"" for several hours.  Tried chatting with the customer service rep, got disconnected, transferred to another agent.  Response time during the chat is very slow. Tried calling. Phone wait is more than 60 minutes. Thank you. I will find another company that has better customer service."
Gerard,3,1,"Absolutely HORRIBLE support. Ever since downloading this to my laptop, it consistently kicks me off my WIFI (never, ever had this issue before) I emailed Bitdefender 2 x , got a responsive email a day or 2 later (not actual customer service, just automated email) I have NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO GET HELP FROM SUPPORT. FAIL!!!!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT"
Klant,2,5,
Tanita,6,5,"Great product, easy to use, does not slow down my PC, very good service via email."
J D,1,1,"worst customer service i experienced,. I just wasnt able to install antivirus like other products, Now I am waiting without answer for refund and its more like 1 month, watch out and stay away, they dont care, what a shame"
Divyanshu Singh,1,5,This is good app by comparing all the app. I must recommend to buy this.
Wally Debling,1,5,"My first interaction with tech support was very positive ! I needed instructions on how to delete old hardware, & add new ones. Instructions were easy to follow, and had everything up & protected in no time. Very happy with the support received and the Bit Defender software. Silent Simple & Effective !!"
Nicole Gauthier-Dion,1,5,I did not have to wait for help and she answered all my questions the first time! I like Bitdefender.Thank you
Mark Tinney,2,5,"Bitdefender is the gold standard of PC security and simply cannot be beaten for value, performance, or customer service."
Rick Foidart,1,4,Total Security is good for the money. Had only a few issues over the past five years. Lots of features in Total security did not get to use all of them still best product for your money as I used other.
Lee Aimesbury,2,5,"I have tried almost all the other software over the last 40 years of IT and technical computer work, and find this software to be the best overall. I have seen all the machination of script/software back to the 8080 boards in the birth of the PC world. I build PC from nothing to a working business unit and  Gamer units at the top end and I would whole heartedly offer Bitdefender as a must have for anyone. Newbie to Pro this is the software you have been waiting for!!"
Stephen Thomas,6,5,An excellent program with excellent features.Bitdefender Total Security is a program I can trust and depend on.
Hermanb,28,3,"The software is really great. I am using it from almost the start of BirDefender. Unfortunately you need the firm Avangate to buy it or to renew the license. And then start the problems.I bought the software for my very small business and also to use private. On the Swedish internet-site of BitDefender. Very clear price: INCLUDING VAT. So I ordered it. And what happens? I get an invoice for that price EXCLUDING VAT. Invoice comes from Avangate Holland. So instead of the price including 25% Swedish VAT I get an invoice excluding 21% Dutch VAT. They just steal the amount that otherwise they has to pay to the Swedish tax-office.Their reply is very stupid: ""BitDefender told us we have to ask the same price for business as for private and SO you have to pay that price."" WHAT? And whatever I do after that, they keep with their stupid reply.Then I thought: let's involve BitDefender, because THEY sold me the product. The only reaction is after a few days: ""Sorry, it will take a little longer."" That is now some weeks ago. So I thought: next time I will take Kaspersky. But what do I see? Kaspersky also use those thieves: Avangate."
Keith Fountain,1,1,Thieves renewed my service despite me declining renewal on their website and cancelling account. Customer service is extremely non-responsive. This company is very difficult to beat through all the levels they have put between themselves and their customers.Very poor company to deal with.
Heather Hunt,1,5,Had a serious issue with my Bitdefender package. Contacted support and was given step-by-step instructions on how to fix the problem. I had to uninstall and reinstall. I did so and got the 2019 version instead of my 2018. Awesome!!!
Frank,1,5,The best antivirus I have ever used and you've got great customer service that went above and beyond by helping me even on a Christmas day!
Nick,2,3,PROS: It does protect the computer well.CONS: Customer support is terrible. Software slows down computer.
KF,1,3,"Great software but their customer support is beyond horrible.  Don't expect any response for assistance for weeks.  I submitted a request on 12/14, received a 'thank you for your patience' email 12/20.  It is 12/26 and still have not gotten an answer. I sent a reminder yesterday but again, no response.  My guess is they have outsourced their support to offshore.  Just hope you don't have any issues or questions because you are on your own."
John Bradle y,1,5,"Good company, recommended by my IT guy. I was using another such software,  paid for a year, but abandoned it for Bitdefender.  Tried another recently, concurrent with Bitdefender, just to see, am back at Bitdefender."
Roland Björk,2,5,"Software combined with excellent support team, always ready to solve any request. Thanks to Bitdefender I can now rest assure."
Iosif Mut,1,1,"You need to login or create an account after you download and install the free version.It is free? No is not. They collect data, this is why. Why need to require a login first and after we can use?Shame BitDefender. Plus I try to install a free tool called traffic light a chrome extension, to prevent the ads and malware and is same, my computer infected.Shame again. Much better Malwarebytes."
T. Gormley,1,5,"After 4 weeks, so far so good and so easy."
Stuart Mackay,2,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for several years now, as a public customer, and find their product, service and support second to none, on top of all that they frequently do cost effective deals on product purchases, so keep an eye out; even after you are a subscriber!"
Andrew Howard,1,5,Great first time experience. Product is simple and straightforward with explanation. It does the job and customer support was great. The agent figured out the problem quickly and was very professional.
Ann Manry,5,5,"You can not go wrong trusting Bitdefender for your computer security.  I have used them for over 4 years now, and they have been excellent.Ann Manry"
Emmanuel,1,5,Bitdefender has been my go to antivirus software for several years and I gladly switched to their paid version in 2015. I feel safe from all threats as I search the internet and my data is protected.
Gaines Blackwell,2,5,"I am 79 and not particularly computer savvy. Several years ago I bought Internet security from Bitdefender as it was highly rated on CNET and on forums. It has done an admirable job, consistently ,  protecting my computer for various attacks. It is easy to install, operate and has not ever failed in its job. Price is reasonable for all you get. You have a customer for life."
Molle,78,5,"It's the best security software on the market, it is amazingly great. They also very nice people working for Bitdefender inc."
Jan Andersen,48,5,"Had a problem, it was solved within 24 hours, that´s great"
Rob Van de Beek,1,5,"Great product, has a lot of options with great pricing and support"
Mr van Dijck,3,1,I purchased Bitdefender internet security. The install went ok and then I rebooted. Bitdefender broke SSL on all my browsers as well as my VPN. Uninstalled the very same day and opened a ticket to ask for a refund. Well it is now going on to week number 3 and I still have not had any reply to my request.Do Not buy this product. For one thing their support is non existent.My ticket number is. 201820110440002. I should not have had to resort to a bad review to get my ticket reviewed. If has taken this long to get a answer I hate to think what tour tech support is like.
Sheri,16,4,"Edited:My experience is currently incomplete, but improving. So far, BitDefender has responded really quickly to my queries, and to my request for a refund. The refund is pending.Based on the communications I have had, which have been polite and helpful, it seems it may be a case of being overwhelmed. I don't know company history, but if they have grown rapidly, it may be that customer service sorts itself out.I may yet have a go with the software, because the software itself seems to have much to say for itself - but it is the process itself that put me off initially. They have responded quickly to my concerns, and have sorted things out, so my ruffled feathers are less so now. I will see if there is a trial version - I can then reconsider.I would love to see BitDefender make the buying process simpler, with less sales emphasis - they do have many interesting products, and knowing about them would be fine, but not when it generates a lot of clicks for the buy - buying should be easy :)I share the concern about the cost - however, no doubt they are finding ways to make it more cost effective to the customer. Personally, all software security companies are missing a trick by not having a 10 license option, given the number of devices people have. It may be slightly less profit, but it has been the reason I have clicked ""buy"" in the past. Just sayin' :) So, assuming all be well, I hope for one further update."
N Vbalog,1,1,"I thought I had a good anti virus sw installed, in fact - I got infected by a trojan, got a Virus plus - absolutely NO support from Bitdefender - 0!They let me hanging there cleaning up the mess on my own.I spent my precious weekend and money for a real anti virus external support.I wrote 8 support  tickets, spoke to 3 support staff who had no clue, could not perform any analysis and were just stealing my time.If you want to be protected buy something else - Bitdefender is good in cashing the money but very bad in performing."
Manos Koukoumidis,1,5,"I think it is by far THE BEST antivirus ever!!! Since I installed , I never had virus problems in my devices."
Jim Fletcher,2,5,An excellent product that has protected my PCs and phones for years without any problems.
i0xHeX,1,3,"As for protection from viruses - good. Not enough, like simple java ransomware can touch your files, but acceptable. The worst here - support. Very slow, very hard to do some bug report, cause they do not reply for days, and then send me email like - we notify you we still process it. Waiting waiting... Nothing. However the bug is simple and fixable. I also tried forum - no reply for a week. There are no ticket system (or may be I don't know about it or hard to find), so If I remove once email, I can't return and reply with needed info to ticket with spec number. So, when the app will have serious bugs - we'll have a huge problems, cause there no good support and bug report system.So now confusing in choice buy this product or not. Cause with problem above product is vulnerable and buggy."
Ali Nang,6,1,"Stay Away, Stole my money. Won't return it cause they want me to either pay less or get double anti-virus time.You can't cancel your own subscription.. that should be enough to keep you away"
Marcus,28,5,Excellent product and great customer service
AG,1,1,"I purchased Bitdefender total security and installed it and all was going fine for 2 months, then the VPN stopped working and asked to renew the license. I tried more than 10 times (and still trying everyday) to call the support center by its both number and it's always saying that the operators are busy as if i'm calling the Whitehouse .. also I emailed them and they fixed it for 1 day and then the problem occurred, I emailed them again and they didn't reply since 10 days ... Very bad experience, a big name with unprofessional administration. Now i'm going to buy Avast VPN .. it's better anyway."
foliocat,5,1,"Seems like I have the same problem as most people here. I paid a cheap 1-year package during their black Friday sale. A year later, they charged me over 2 times the amount in an 'auto-renewal' without my acknowledgement. They then ignore any emails afterwards to which I find is very unprofessional. I have used BitDefender for 2 years and the product is fine but I now DO NOT recommend them! Next time, I'm going to buy a physical anti-virus from a different company.Update 15/12/18: I am wondering why they still have not responded to me after all this time. I would expect that a professional company would have the decency to at least communicate with their customers!"
alan sams,2,1,Bought their product and when I tried to download it a warning came up on screen saying that I didn't have sufficient CPU and that it would seriously effect my computer's performance. Relatively new Asus Zen with i 5 processor and 4GB Ram so I wouldn't have thought there would have been an issue but I decided to cancel straightaway. After emailing them and speaking to their Customer Service I am still waiting for a reply over two weeks later. Terrible customer service and I will stay well clear of them in the future especially after some of the reviews I have read here. It remains to be seen whether I will get my money back.
christopher blum,2,2,"L have not used bitdefender for over a year.yet they have charged me for a product l don’t use.i have contacted them in order to get a refund,and iam met with silence.i had no complaints about there product but when auto renew is not activated.they still take money from my account.not happy."
D M,2,5,"Been a fan of Kaspersky for years and tried Bitdefender since KAV proves to be Putin's backdoor and I'm utterly impressed with Bitdefender lightweight resources usage and rate of detection. Probably I should have looked at it much sooner. Flawless product, extremely impressed, tested properly before acquiring the license and I'm very happy so far."
Abdallah,1,1,"I am very disappointed that my subscription was automatically renewed without my permission. They said on their website that I should receive email notifications before the actual renewal takes place. I have not received any sort of notifications, nor I remember if this auto-renewal was stated in the terms and conditions when I subscribed three years ago. I have sent several emails to Bitdefender but with no reply so far!An update:My assigned ticket number is 2018120800440002.I know that maybe the refund money is very little for you, but it was my rent and food in the fridge for a month, and it messed up my whole month's budget. Could you please give me a timeframe for how long it will take to get my money back?Dear Marcus and others who had a great experience with Bitdefender's customer service,I have no shred of doubt that you are a real person and had a genuinely great experience with Bitdefender's customer service. Could you please share with us if there is a specific email or an efficient method to reach the customer service because I literally tried everything with no luck. It took them three days to reply to my post here. Please share with us your experience and how did you reach Bitdefender's customer service.Many thanks in advance :)"
Daniel Saunders,14,5,I've been using Bitdefender for many years and it never fails or gets compromised. Also this is what i recommend to my friends when they ask me what security software i'm using.
angie,2,1,"I’ve been told for the second time that I am top priority for my refund on an auto renewal that I did not confirm. They responded to me real fast after this review  but it’s the same automated reply. I started on November 24th and it’s December 6 now.  Customer service is terrible. You wait forever to speak to someone and after being on hold for half an hour they put me hold for another 30 minutes just to say again I’m high priority. Their English is terrible, but I guess it really doesn’t matter because this/ they are nothing but scammers.Here is the ticket number you requested 2018112505370001"
Bob Lowe,2,5,I switched to BitDefender several years ago and have not experienced a virus attack since.  I recommend and trust BitDefender 100% and their support is superb!
Ed Colandra,1,1,"By far the WORST response from a software vendor (and I used to own one) that I have ever seen. Calls go unreturned. Online chats are suddenly disconnected. I want to write to the head of Bitdefender. I want him/her to know that it is my intention to write as many negative reviews as possible on Google, Yelp, Download.com, and anywhere else their product is sold. It will not install on my plain old Windows 10 Lenovo machine.Nothing fancy, and every time they do something, it REMOVES the repair from the last person. Listen here Bitdefender PIGS, I am seeking justice, and plan to get it. Oh and here's my order ID 86493160 and my open ticket number is 2018111203080002 just so you know I am not a competitor creating a fake rating. JUST FIX IT BY FRIDAY OR MY REVIEWS WILL BEGIN EVERYWHERE EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MONEY ! ed colandra"
william,10,4,Bitdefender is a great product for Mac and PC; but support can sometimes be rather slow.
Cliff King,1,5,"The best computer protection you can buy, customer service is over the top never takes more than a couple of hours for a response. I would recommend this product to anyone."
Carol Jolin,1,5,"Completely satisfied!  Frequent updates, ""Dashboard"" available for other services and tech support is fast and accurate!! Will definitely renew coverage!!"
Steen Pedersen,2,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for several years now. Their combination of high malware detection rate and userfriendly program is right for me.Every year, I review independent AV test sources to see which company is best at detecting and stopping malware. Bitdefender has always been at the very top."
Neil Jeffries,3,5,Have used Bitdefender for the last four years and see no reason to change the provider. At 81 years of age I am not of the computer literate generation but their customer help services helped me resolve any problems that arose.
Dragan Rozic,1,5,One of two best security software on the world and their support team is very kind and fast to help. As an inexperienced user  I had good experiences with them.
Des Ashby,1,5,Relatively easy to manage Very easy to get instant help.
Vladimir Shvartsman,1,5,"My four years experience of using Antivirus          verified, the software is secure and flexible (many options on settings). I am very satisfied with Bitdefender."
Tom Fowler,14,5,"Got them on a Humble Bundle 4-5 years back I think - I haven't changed since then because nothing has ever gone wrong. Solid defence and does everything in the background without screaming at me like some of the free alternatives used to.Nice - no bloatware, no forced toolbar for the web - just smoother sailing. Would recommend"
Chris Steffler,1,5,"Hi all,Bitdefender seems very secure and does not slow your PC to any tangible degree. Good attentive customer service. Chris StefflerToronto Canada"
J,1,1,"1 year of testing out their service and it did absolutely nothing for me. The reason I came here to write this is that I believe they are scamming people.They change their login procedure regularly so you never know which site is the correct one to login and therefore you can't cancel your account. I was billed after emailing a request that my account be turned off. They didn't turn off my account and charged me for a second year. Now that I'm trying to reconcile that dubious move of theirs, there is no recourse. PayPal won't help, BitDefender's checkout system ""forwarded my message"", and BitDefender only sent me a confirmation they'd received my refund request after I sent 5 messages. Still no word back from them. Total scam."
Nordic,5,5,"Takes out the guessing of security issues. It just works, recommend over any other product used in the past. Will be staying with Bitdefender. Using family pack and installed on multiple devices iMac, Windows laptops and 3 android phones with premium VPN for 'peace of mind' connecting on public wireless"
Irish Eyes,9,5,STAY AWAYI have given this mob a 5 star rating because most people read them first. What a joke this company are thankfully I gave up on a subscription before I paid. How can you expect any form of customer service when the people who are bein paid to do a job cannot understand English. I have just spent 25 minutes trying to give my email adreess to a complete fool
Yvonne,7,5,"I have used Bitdefender for 10 months now and I wanted to purchase a new subscription with a (good) Black Friday discount, but I was worried I'd lose my 2 remaining months. I contacted customer services who were very helpful in ensuring my subscription would run consecutively."
John,2,1,Customer service for bitedefender is horrible I disabled the auto renew when I first purchased bite defender after a year of using it I disabled it again after I decided not to renew my subscription.  That was a year and a half ago on Thanksgiving day they renewed my subscription without any notice or my approval claiming that auto renew was still active I have wrote many disapproving emails and even have a work order with them to correct their mistake and return what they took out of my account all I have gotten so far are sales pitches to use their software I find this highly irregular I just want what they took back into my account
Greg Ferguson,1,5,Have used it on my 5 devices for several years now and no issues with any of my devices...Think it is because of the excellent protection bitdefender provides
Byron Miller,1,5,"I have run BD on my computers loaded with MS Windows for several years. I tried a few other Anti virus programs prior to that and found that they slowed my computers and interfered with the operating functions. Bitdefender runs in the background, updates and keeps watch on my computer/programs/Internet surfing without slowing or interfering with my computers functions/operation. BD also has caught and blocked many bugs/viruses/malware that other security programs missed."
donmago,1,5,Very strong protection. The recently updated Bitdefender user interface is much improved. I recently found that if current Bitdefender subscribers purchase a new Bitdefender product of the same type the new duration time is added to the current subscription remaining duration. This was especially appealing in relation to Cyber Monday/Black Friday deals. The individualized and updated Bitdefender Central website is very helpful for managing a user's devices and software.
Daryll E,1,1,"Horrible Customer service! During my time with bitdefender I've send multiple e-mails towards their customer service and not once(!) did I receive any form of reply. Now, after one year, the subscription to their service automatically renewed without my consent and I never opted for it! Furthermore, not only is it automatically renewed, but also at a much higher price then when I would be a new customer. Since the renewal (multiple weeks ago) I've send a couple of e-mails again only to get just one reply saying ""thanks you for contacting us, we will review your issue and reply soon"". The latter is already more than we week ago.Avoid if you can!"
Brian Langley,3,5,Bitdefender does everything I ask if it seamlessly and without manual intervention.
Dennis Hamand,15,5,A very simple secure system I would highly recommend everyone to use
Partha Pratim Das,2,5,"Bitdefender was/is/will be the only security software, I and my friends will spend money on. There are numerous high quality premium security softwares in the market, out of which, I used Kaspersky, Norton, AVG, Avira, McAfee and Bitdefender - both as an user and administrator for more than 8 years, out of which McAfee performed very poorly and the rest were just satisfactory compared to Bitdefender. I'm very happy that Bitdefender outperformed everyone in terms of security, performance and reliability except for their price for both corporate and private clients. Thank you Bitdefender for serving my needs and digitally protecting my computer along with million others."
Dale Miller,1,5,"I've had Bitdefender since i build my pc almost three years ago and i've never once had an issue with it. its very quiet, does everything it needs to do in the backround and doesnt require me to devote very much time to it at all. it has all the options i can think of for computer security and overall i'm very happy with the purchase. they're always doing deals on their products too so its easy to get the total security for pretty cheap. definitely the best value for what you get!"
George Mentzikof,1,5,Very light weight AV and security suite. Correctly priced. Full of features and easy to setup and use. Great support. Never had a problem with viruses or any other malware since started to use.
Shahrokh,1,5,
j. Lamperth,1,5,"I have approached Bitdefender Customer Care via email for a problem I was having - to enable a product on my PC. I needed a password that I long forgotten. Soon received an email with detailed instructions, but unfortunately after many tries and help from Bitdefender Customer Care Team, it did not work. / it was not the usual way to change a password/.I gave up, informed the team that I want to close the case. They just kept encouraging me / ""senior citizen""/ Eventually Karl, a very knowledgeable and patient technician, on the phone took me through all the steps the problem required / 45 min./ and the case was solved.I would definitely recommend this company!"
London99,9,1,"AVOID! Bitdefender renews customer's subscriptions and takes money out of their bank accounts without consent, then doesn't respond to requests for a refund. In my case I ignored emails from Bitdefender that my cover was about to 'Expire' and that I needed to 'Act Now' to continue being protected. I deliberately didn't 'act now' as I didn't want to continue being protected by Bitdefender for reasons I shall give below. Little did I know that Bitdefender would renew the unwanted subscription anyway. No where did their emails say that if I failed to act they would renew my account, in fact they said the opposite. As far as I am concerned this is criminal conduct. I am now taking advice and alerting the authorities. As for the Bitdefender product itself, it places far too heavy a burden on a PC slowing everything down, and nor was it effective at preventing my PC from becoming infected. I have found Kaspersky far lighter on PCs and far more effective at preventing infections. Maybe that's why Kaspersky doesn't have to press gang people into renewing subscriptions with borderline illegal tactics. Disgraceful."
Sandy,2,2,Thank you Bitdefender for finally responding to my request for support. It is concerning that one has to ‘go public’ to get your attention. With your rebate for at least some of my ‘surplus’ I now have 557 days protection and feel more secure!
Howard Freeman,5,2,"I have a real problem with uninstalling bitdefender so I used the ""Chat"" form on bitdefender.com. I asked for a real person and waited quite a while for a human to reply - nothing. Very poor service, great product."
Vernon,2,1,They basically stole $200 dollars from be because of auto pay and wouldn't reimburse me even though I wasn't using there services anymore. Total crooks if you ask me. I'll never use there services again and definitely wouldn't recommend them. No empathy or understanding. My kids could of used that money for Christmas.
Yasmin Meghani,1,5,"I’m very happy with your customer care assistant, the one who helped me. He guided me step by step and my issue was resolve. He had lots of patience.  I have already recommended your services to my family and friends."
Radar Boomer,1,5,Great product and easy to use. The installation was smooth. The product covers all my requirements. If required the support group is quick and responsive with follow ups for the issue and post issue
Kenny Hille,4,5,"the TOP program for Firewall, virus and other bad things."
Alex T,2,5,"Great team and great product. The best on the market to be fair. I can honestly say that is nothing that these guys don’t know about viruses, spyware, malware and other *wares out there. Highly recommend the only one actually"
Jonathan_S,13,1,"The Software works OK, but not great, and is available online for a reasonable price. HOWEVER their customer service is terrible to non-existent, they suckered me into a subscription and suddenly treble the price with no warning and refuse to acknowledge the refund request that was submitted almost as soon as I understood what was happening. 6 weeks later and all I have are 3 auto-response messages apologising for taking so long. Best avoid or at best delete your account with them after 364 days."
Sven Oskar Herbert Lind,7,5,The best antivirus there is and they are always helpful
John Hall,2,5,I must admit that after experiencing other programs that were very intrusive and hard to follow etc I found Bitdefender to be vastly different. It is easy to follow and when I have an issue that I don't understand or need advice I have always found the service dept very fast and efficient. My family also use the product and like wise find it excellent.
David Anthony Evans,2,5,"Bitdefender Total Security is a very good product offering excellent very good security and is comprehensive in covering most aspects of security for users,  Highly recommend the product"
Marian Grantham,1,2,The product is fine. It works well. The low review is because it just charged me a whopping 83 dollars to renew. Which is twice the amount a new customer would pay. Unconscionable! Avoid only because of this.
Chaos01,1,5,As far as I know very few false alarms...  As a result I am very happy with it..
MT,1,4,"Exceptional customer support that is easily and quickly accessible I think 24/7. BitDefender provides excellent protection, yet IMO, it's interface could be made better by redesign making more intuitive several  of its functional features and their and overall interfacing. I use BitDefender along with MalwareBytes and both work seamlessly together with no system conflicts whatsoever."
Henry Burt,1,5,Have been using Bit Defender Total Security for several years and have never had a virus. The cost is very competitive to protect 5 devices.  Have had a couple of software glitches over the years; the tech support team is very knowledgeable and the response time is extremely fast. Definitely recommend.
janaratn,7,1,I bought Bitdefender 2018 DVD from eBay.I have used Macafee and Kaspersky before But the experience I had with BitDefender was horrible. First dvd didn't run in my computer.T hen I contacted the dealer and said that can't refund. Then He assisted me to download online. After installing it My computer became very slow and didn't allow to google chrome to open. My computer is a brand new All in one PC with a good speed. So I uninstalled it and I wasted money.I sincerely recommend nobody should buy this programme.
ianj39,3,5,"Bitdefender seems to offer a high level of security, and a comprehensive set of functions. When the occasional glitch occurs (not surprising with such a complex item of software) support is easy to contact, listens well, and gives impressive personal attention to a quick resolution of the problem."
Brian Hogan,1,5,Bitdefender does a great job protecting my and my family's computers from malware and other threats.  The support they offer is top notch.
John E Peiffer III,1,5,Excellent product and customer service.
Joseph,1,5,Good Job Team!!!My query was resolved and I am very happy for that. It was done through good followup and Bitdefender techsupport updated me everytime about what should be done next. So good job team!!!
Len Vaughn,1,3,"So far, I'm unimpressed with the quality of their products.  I bought in to their system hoping to provide ""coverage"" for the teen-with-iphone, as well as the home network. I also installed their Android app.   I never could get the iPhone product to work well enough to keep the teen, or myself, from having to uninstall it.The BD Box 2 appeared to work until a few months ago when our WiFi started dropping every couple hours.  Investigation so far points to the BD Box itself.  Tech support has acknowledged my query, but after more than 1 week, that is all.I understand supporting users in this space is difficult.  I gave them a ""pass"" with the iOS app, hoping a subsequent upgrade would fix their problems, but ultimately simply gave up on that.  Losing main internet service, however is completely unacceptable, and if I don't hear from them soon, will change this to a negative review, disconnect their unstable box, and go back to relying on my main firewall, and reliable high quality service."
Zvonko Grgurević,1,5,"Excellent products, friendly and knowledgeable  people to deal with ."
Ron Austin,1,5,A very good program and customer care very good.
James Hutcheson,6,5,I would recommend this For computor security and peace of mind ( TOTAL SECURITY )  Version. Support is very helpful and patient.
Phil Hostetter,1,2,"Just got notice that BD has expired six months after I signed up for it as part of a service contract with MI Tech, which apparently does tech support for Amazon Alexa.The secondary vender responded and updated BD on on computer.  Unfortunately, the update didn't transfer to my second covered computer . . . ."
Brian Ewart,2,5,An excellent service with real peace of mind and sound experience proven over years of use.
Goldenplay,44,5,"After having tried McAfee, Norton and TrendMicro, I finally found the perfect solution. I just re-subscribed, 3rd year in a row. Doesn't slow down my machine, works seamlessly, new features are being added as new threats out there require them, knowledgeable support, and on top of all that affordable pricing that covers 5 devices."
Ashoka Pandey,2,5,Excellent customer service from a company that enjoys excellent assessments from its peers.
Laurentiu Draia,1,5,
Mike Doyle,3,1,DOES NOT WORK ON LATEST MAC OSWho writes these glowing reviews?  The CEO of Bitdefender.  A truly soul destroying experience - couldn't get software to install on latest version of MAC because the install is out of date and doesn't correctly integrate with mac system extensions.Support sent me a bunch of completely unhelpful links and my end conclusion is that software does not work on Mac - 2 hours wasted.  Don't listen if thy tell you this software works on Mac.  Save yourself 2 hours of stress
Sam x,1,5,"my 5 star rating to the Bitdefender is for being very very supportive, they were so flexible and generous about solving my issue,"
Максим Карпов,1,5,Bitdefender is one of the best products. He is very fast. Excellent customer service. Also very pleased with the stock to buy products.
Anh Hoang,1,5,"Bitdefender, the best software to protect your computer, period! I have used other software, Norton, Symantec, never felt a hundred percent satisfied. I was always worry why my system behaved this way or that way, and the system update never going through without problems, I have to ignored them most of the time. I finally switch to Bitdefender last year, I never felt more confident like I do now and the support team is outstanding, very knowledgeable team. I would recommended to every one I know."
malware destroyer,1,4,among the best AV products on the marked.. very few false detection.easy contact to support.
Paul Stephen Daniels,1,2,"Somehow, Bitdefender became corrupted on my MacBook Pro, and I need to reinstall it.  I kept getting an error message when I went to uninstall the original program, and so I called tech support.  There was an immense amount of loud, high-pitched electronic interference on the line.  To add to the challenge of getting help, both of the techs with whom I spoke had heavily accented English.  The second tech could not resolve my problem and said I would receive an e-mail from higher-level colleagues with instruction.  I received the e-mail.  The instructions worked up to a certain point, and then I was stymied again.  I decided to try online chat this time to avoid the problem with line noise and accents.  The online tech simply took my information concerning the problem and told me to await yet another e-mail from higher-level tech personnel.  I told him I had hoped to get my problem resolved via online chat.So I am now awaiting an e-mail.  In the meantime, the program for which I paid is not giving me the protection I sought when I purchased it, and I have no idea how long I will have to sit by my computer awaiting the e-mail.This is the very definition of poor customer service.Paul DanielsTelford, PA"
Yane,3,5,I use Bitdefender Antivirus more than 8 years. I was always really happy with that software. Never had any problem with viruses neither with computer (slow !!??). I highly recomend Bitdefender Antivirus to everybody.
Martin,5,5,
Art Kerley,1,1,"Very disappointed with this product. I contacted customer service and they took several days to respond and then sent me a ""do not reply e-mail"" telling me that they were addressing my concerns and would get back to me. However, I have yet to hear from them. I get a daily message that Bitdefender has been updated and I'm told that I'm safe. I continue to receive threats via e-mail and have beed advised repeatedly that my mailbox has been hacked, yet Bitdefender keeps telling me that I am protected. I would not buy this product again and would not recommend its purchase."
Alan Frost,7,1,"Absolutely useless. Been fighting with this program for over a year. It claims to be the best, but the only reason I can see that it would be better than others is that it simply blocks everything, whether good or bad. Every problem I have had with my programs delivering errors and failing to connect were due to Bitdefender. So it has to be disabled constantly.The final straw though was when even disabling it was not enough. I had a translation program that worked fine for years and out of the blue started to produce connection errors. I disabled Bitdefender and nothing happened. After 2 weeks of troubleshooting with Support and losing business, we realised that Bitdefender had to be completely uninstalled for it to work.Edit: In response to your enquiry, I did not deal with the matter with Bitdefender Support, as I had no idea that Bitdefender was to blame until the very end. The matter was eventually resolved by the Support of the translation tool that had suddenly stopped working."

Graham,10,1,I'm in the process of choosing Antivirus software and was looking at Bitdefender … came here to see what people thought.I have never come across so many apparently cut and paste reviews for a product/company before.Makes me extremely suspicious.
Vijay,2,5,I have been a longtime Bitdefender product user and always been and continue to be impressed with the product and services offered ( I use TOTAL SECURITY) the tech support and customer care TEAMS as professional and compassionate as you can get or expect.Issues if any related to tech or subscription and in between are ALWAYS taken care with promptness and follow up.Also the product is cost effective and have credentials to be the constantly top in the market place with 24/7 reliable support and FREE UPDATES as well as FREE product TRIALS for all your security needs.just4ufolks  Oct 15 2018
Michael F,4,2,"Have had bitdefender for some years but their last udate meant that my Canon printer was prevented from communicating with the Win10 laptop. it works perfectly when Bitdefender is uninstalled and using Windows Defender! Also the majot update in seprember caised various files to be deleted the most important being Outlook contacts but most other Office software was affected, re-installing has overcome but contacts totaly wiped. On contact with Bitdefender nothing has happened for nearly a month except for emails asking me to be patient. Now if this company cannot resolve problems they have coded in their own software how can we have faith in them overcoming virus attacks etc. The answer is obviously no. And still they cannot resolve. Still they have my money so to them losing one customer is nothing.So Bitdefender can email within minutes of publishing a review to try and persuade me to change my review but still have done nothing to resolve the problem since 26 September!"
Ronella Pampilon,1,5,Excellent Customer Care. First time that I got no issues with customer service. Product did the job.
Rothman Philips,1,1,"If you value documents and information that you save on your hard drive, I would not recommend ,not at all ,not even point one percent recommend Bitdefender 2019.they know and they have known of serious issues for almost a month and a half now and still havent rectified it where it's locking up hard drives and constantly reading and writing data on to external hard drives and damaging a lot of peoples hard drives. don't get it, just don't"
Alex Naghi,1,5,The best antivirus money cant buy!
Maria,1,5,"I have tried other security programs for my electronic devices, some of the most well known on the market. I have been using Bitdefender for a few years now and I truly feel that all of my devices, which include a desktop, tablet and cell phone are well protected. I am notified immediately on each individual device if there is an immediate threat. I have not had any viruses or threats since purchasing the program. I don't mind the higher security level required to make modifications to my account, it is well worth it to me. I highly recommend the product."
Don,2,5,Great and easy to use product with outstanding after-purchase customer service.

Robert,2,5,"So far I have no complaints.I have had a couple of teething problems solved very quickly. If I get the same service over the next twelve months, I will certainly be renewing my License."
John Stewart,5,5,having bitdefender failing to update properly. the service I received in fixing my problem was very well taken care of. person who help me remain in constant contact with me till I was completely satisfied. I would recommend this product. being able to purchase on line for more then one year term is also great .
Zoltán Megyeri,1,5,"The software is user friendly, reliabIe and easy to use. (And of yourse one of the best AV solutions.) I've had to contact the support team due to the fault of the store I bought the software from. The support is excellent: prompt answers, kind staff, issue quickly resolved. I would definitely recommend Bitdefender from every aspect."
Catherine Clarke,3,5,Excellent customer serviceGreat protection at a reasonable price
Phil Coleman,2,5,"Very good product, easy to use."
Bob Read,2,5,"Bitdefender performs exactly as advertised. It runs smoothly and silently in the background, and has absolutely no effect on system resources. Bitdefender is an excellent AV software product."
James,4,2,"Wow, had a problem with Bitdefender total security updating and their one click optimizer about which I contacted their customer support. After several automated emails advising they are looking into it a week has gone by with nothing done. This isn't the service I was expecting when I renewed with them (been a Bitdefender fan for a few years now) and will definitely be a consideration when renewal comes up. Their product is easy to buy but the real test is aftercare and I find it lacking. I'm still waiting for help with this as I write so please feel free to get in touch Bitdefender re RE: New Open ticket: 2018092507120002."
LINDA D 3193,1,5,Bitdefender works to protect your computer. The antivirus testing companies rate this product the very best. And their tech support and customer service departments HAVE YOUR GOODNESS AT HEART.
David Swanson,1,1,"Deletes files without permission, this program deleted over a GB of game files without even asking or bothering with quarantining the files like a normal AV would do. The only way to get the files back is to download and pay for a program to recover the files that the program lost for you.These are the actions of malware, not an antivirus program."
justrand,4,5,"I absolutely love the Bitdefender product and their team of brilliantly qualified software engineers.  I have purchased this product for a 3rd year in a row and it's constantly updating to protect me from any new virus or malware, as it also provides me my own VPN and keeps my devices safe from attack.  I feel it's the best security available.  I base that on the awards they receive year after year for being best. Get this and you'll safely surf the web...  and not have to worry about sinister activity infecting your computer or stealing your information."
Paul,1,4,A great product for the price with many features. My devices have never been infected and highly recommend.
Lloyd G,1,5,"Customer support was helpful and prompt, in addition they are clear and precise on their instructions. Great product, very satisfied with its customer service."
Randy Linder,1,5,"Love this product. I've used it on all my devices for several years and just keeps getting better. I spend zero time now tracking down malware. Use to drive me insane. Seems like I used to spend most my time fixing things rather than just use my computer. No more with Bitdefender. It just works. There's a little bit of set up time on the front end, but boy does it pay off. (And just so you know, I'm saying all this good stuff for no payment.) And I have very little complaint."

Dan Brasher,1,5,"Today's Bitdefender Total Security is a comprehensive and intuitive product that addresses ALL threats.  I have most recently used Avast!, Avira, and Trend Micro (paid) - and Bitdefender rises to the top of the group.  It even managed to fix a problem (loss of ability to receive Windows Updates) with my Windows 7 PC that I was unable to resolve after more than 40 hours of trying - I had given up a few years ago, but after checking some boxes in Bitdefender, I received ALL crucial updates dating back 3 years!  I am also pleased with the fact that, for a few dollars more, I can not only protect all the PCs in our house, but also those of our grown children.  Thank you Bitdefender for looking at what users really need and delivering it!"
hitbit,3,5,"We have been using BitDefender Total Security to protect all our devices for some years now. To date it has let nothing do harm stopping many things in their tracks. We had used other programmes in previous years but found they had many shortcomings from price, to protection offered and very high resource usage. BitDefender addresses all of these issues. Hitbit"
Jack Simmons,3,3,"I've had BD TS for 3 months and this is what I can say. I gets excellent scores from testing labs, so I believe my PC is very well protected, that's the main thing. Here's what I didn't like: it takes 600mb RAM on my computer, that's way too much. It updated from 2018 to 2019 at its own will. I believe this kind of decision should be up to the user, I don't like this kind of conduct.Two times in this period Windows Action Center said I had no AV protection, no firewall, etc. The next day things got fixed. I read a user's comment about the same problem, he had it even more often than me. After updating to 2019 it interrupts my games with popups like ""Port scan has been detected"". I didn't find how I can set it to silent mode, in which 2018 was by default. And finally, it crashed my compurer(Windows 7 32bit) when doing the update, which led to some useful data being lost. I checked the logs - the crash had happened on that very day and about the same time when BD was updating. I didn't have crashes for months before this event. So, generally, BD is a good product, but if it crashes your PC that's a serious minus."
Nick,2,5,"Bitdefnder Total Security is worth the price and keeps my computers safe from all the bad out on the WWW, and the customer support has a human to help if there is a problem, making it even better to get and use, I love the fact it is not connected to any Russian program that invades and uses private information. Thanks Bitdefender."
Colin,1,5,Used Bitdefender for many years. Quality of the product is excellent and the support service when needed is first class. I have found Bitdefender to be the best security system I have used.  It does not slow down my computer and gives a high confidence level of being an excellent security system for all my computers. Very good value for the money.

Aleksandar Dragičević,2,5,I am very satisfied with ability and mange of bitdefender
John Warner,2,5,It works well for me. I have it on both my PC and laptop and seem to be safe. Cost is rising quite fast and in the last two years my charge is up 50% which is a bit steep.Customer service excellent but not easy to find numbers to ring.
SUDHY,1,5,"Bitdefender Security Products is user friendly, Bitdefender is good for long term subscription because they replace old product with new product every year as and when the product is ready. Bitdefender has AUTO PILOT MODE which protect our system automatically and gives warnings and prompt corrective action. The virus definition get updated frequently. Bitdefender gives weekly usage report. Bitdefender offers Live Chat facility for it's customer's. We can also send complaint report from within the Bitdefender App and they will give Token Number for our problem. Bitdefender executive will contact you till your problem is solved and you get satisfied. Overall Bitdefender gives great customer satifaction and also Bitdefender is customer friendly."

Julie Alexander,4,5,I have the Antivirus Plus and I think it is great value for money. Customer support is very good and Bitdefender is constantly coming out top in reviews. It also works quietly unlike some virus protection.
Rosanna,11,1,"The product is great, when it works. When it doesn't, it creates havoc in your machine. And when you try and get help from the customer service, they tell you there is no problem to be solved. And yet, at every freaking update, your machine can't find its DNS, cannot even flush it, and several reboots - both of the pc and the router - are required to solve it. Till the next update, of course. You keep contacting them, they keep telling you there's no issue to be solved."
Wiersma,7,5,"Excellent product, with superb customer care."
GregS,3,5,"Very affordable and light on system resources. I've used Bitdefender for many years now and they keep getting better.For an in depth review go check out The PC Security Channel on YouTube and search Bitdefender 2019 , they have an excellent review putting Bitdefender to the test."
Dean Massam,1,5,Their product is great and when it comes to follow-up service they exceed also. I have used other security providers and none have provided service like these guys.
Martin Shergold,1,5,Great product with great support
Michael Martin,9,5,"Bitdefender, you'll either love it or hate it. I like it a lot compared to other vendor's apps. It does not hog my system resources to do its job, and only if there is a possible chance of a serious system breach do you know that it is there.I also like that when I online bank the app automatically switches to Safepay mode."

Furthermore Bitdefender Mobile Security does not use much power, thus it keeps phone battery to be used for long time. A perfect solution for mobile/handphone security."
Glenn Joss,21,1,"Their products are great however there customer service is absolutely useless.They charged me twice for the same product and I been trying for over 4 days to get a refund !When you speak to customer services they just dont care !They are very sneaky as they hide away an auto renew clause or button I didn't see it . So I purchased the software package at £29.99 a special offer because they had been rubbish previously, then they charged me £69.99 again for the same product.They also were sending me special offers for their product way before mine ran out and their special offers for being a loyal Bit defender customer were more expensive than the prices available to anyone on their website."
Adrain Tanase,9,2,"English: Just to let everybody know that Bitdefender app is compatible with IOS devices BUT not working as antivitus on MAC and other IOS. Thus when you see the add saying total protaction for IOS and MAC devises is actually misleading advertising. I told them this issue and they said will look into it. So in conclusion if you have IOS or Mac do not buy Bitdefender, is not working on this devices despite saying total protection for them.Romanian:  answer from Bitdefender: Produsul este compatibil cu dispozitivele IOS doar ca nu este folosit ca un antivirus pe acele device-uri deoarece securitatea oferita de cei de la Apple este suficienta . Tocmai de aceea locurile din subscriptia dumneavoatra nu sunt ocupate de acele dispozitive. Inteleg complet punctul dumneavoatra de vedere si ne cerem scuze pentru situatia creata."
Cerul Liber,1,5,"I`m using Bitdefender for years, as trial user and top3 beta tester. They have been #1 antivirus for years antd this for many reasons.beside interface and marketing, it's a strong, tallented team, they have resources to fight back online criminals.Right now I was using online chat to report a non-standard dating scam and it was very fast to finish a huge international scam to team. Love chat, responsitive, flexibility and instant adjustments to online and barely legal thieves.I suggest to buy their complete services including Bitdefender Box in order to have an private werewolf to watch mankind's back from online jerks and hunt them down to their deaths."
Arne Mathiesen,2,5,"An easy to use program, one of the best I've had, and my next program is also being ordered at Bitdefinder, a very good buy is my review, thanks Bitdefender.Arne Mathiesen"
pip pepters,1,5,"They put automatically renew in fine print, my expiry date and renew date were different so they renewed my early at full price, asked for a refund and getting nowhere extremely fast. They cancelled the auto renew but nothing else. Had a satisfactory resolution from the retention team so upping my review to 5 stars as the product is very good my issue was with how my renewal happened."
Mr Gibbons,6,5,"After checking all the reviews I could find I decided to go with the top recommended security program. Had a problem with printing, but BitDefender support cleared the fault."
Steven,1,5,"In my opinion, and from my experience, I find Bitdefender products to be the best for mine and my families needs.  Additionally, I have had exemplary customer care service.  They have been prompt, helpful and relentless in tending to any and all matters regarding their products.Thank you, Bitdefender!S."
ROBERT SEGRAVES,2,1,"Cannot cancelhad trouble loading softwarecontacted company numerous times and given faulty informationfinally got email that to cancel need to call company   of course, telephone line always busy and I was disconnected while waitingif the product is so good why does company need to make it impossible to cancel"

Ali Dahud,1,5,Great and easy to use. and worth it.
So Far Out,4,5,"It has been over a month now since I moved from using Norton, which I've been with since their Norton 360 variant and I am happy to confirm the transition is flawless.  I had been worried about my Norton safe, being lost in the process but all my passwords had been safely integrated to Bitdefender's wallet variant.I had an issue regarding one of their services, which was not as immediate as I intended, or what i misunderstood at the time of purchasing from their product store page. They where more than helpful to change the wrongly chosen product to an alternative service of an extra year of subscription.I do get daily updates and I feel that Bitdefender is giving more of an up to date service than I had before."
Josephine Baker,1,5,I have been a Bitfender customer for over 5 years and I have found them to be awesome. Whenever I have had an issue with my Bitfender (e.g. wanting to download to my other devices) the customer services department are wonderful and always follow up to make sure I am happy with the resolution.  I love the price too as I took advantage of a super special for AUD$60 for one year for 5 devices.  Great!!!  I have no reason to change and will not be doing so. Thank you Bitfender.
Starla Immak,2,1,"These people are a virus. They put automatically renew in fine print, and if the product renews it takes an act of god to get a refund.  I have so far contacted these folks three times and so far I was sent an advertisement to respond to in my e-mail box, and I have still not received a refund."
Sanda Tatar,2,5,"Everything is easy and secure on my PC when I have Bitdefender Internet Security 2019 as an antivirus!For a long time, it has been guarding the security of my data and internet connections. What I'm telling you now is that I recommend to everyone to try it and if they like to use it.I do not think he has a competitor ... soon Bitdefender!"
George,1,5,I had messed things up migrating data to a new computer.  Both the initial contact rep and the followup reps were very friendly yet professional.  The were willing to go as slow or fast as I wanted and they ultimately solved my problem by signing into my computer.  They have both the best in class product AND support.  Bitdefender is really the only choice.
Rory,1,5,I have been using bitdefender total security for over five years now. Says it all really. Reliable and secure.
Mr David Nevett,12,5,"We have been with Bit Defender for ten years or more with business in Canada and now retired in the UK; threats and attempts to compromise our computers have been identified on many occasions, but always detected and dealt with by Bitdefender. Over the years we have had occasion to seek additional support for administration, most recently to merge our old and more recent accounts, which took less than hour, once the problem had been identified. At no time has there been any interruption of the Bitdefender protection service coverage. While we have no experience of this product with smartphones, Bitdefender can be highly recommended for small business, laptop and family home computer needs."
roskelld,1,5,"Been using Bitdefender for a number of years now and found it to work well, it's stopped a number of virus and malware hits on my PC which has made it worth the price.I've had a number of issues, account and software, all of which the support staff have dealt with.Negatives: I'm not a fan of any software using my desktop to advertise and Bitdefender does use desktop pop-ups to advertise new paid for versions. I don't mind email, but software shouldn't use the desktop as a sales point. New versions of Bitdefender can sometimes take a step back incompatibility, causing previously working apps to be blocked or have issues, so far these have all been resolved for me, but it can take time to fix bugs which prior versions didn't have."
Michael T,1,1,Ticket #: 2018081600390002I received an email a week prior to my subscription about to expire and that it would auto renew. So I decided to click the link to cancel auto renewal which would not load once I clicked the button. So a day later I log onto my laptop and choose disable auto-renewal which was several days before my membership was set to renew. Now I checked my bank balance and was charged a renewal for another year. I tried calling Bitdefender about a refund in which they told me they would have someone reach out to me. I received an email about two offers of discounts for the product but I told them I would just like a full refund since I did not want to renew in the first place and turned auto-renewal off several days before my renewal date. I still have yet to hear back from them about my refund days later.
Boris Nemet,2,5,"Best security solution!Highly satisfied with the product. No issues with any of the devices (PC, Mac, Android phone). Family Pack is a great possiblity. Extremely simple to install on any device."
Ed Matson,1,5,"Absolutely awesome, the best leading edge security protection on the planet, bar none..  I am a Bitdefender lifey for sure.."
Pat Kelley,1,5,I have had Bitdefender for over 3 yrs and feel it is by far the best internet security out there.  Issues that arise are quickly taken care of and I like the fact that they have Safepay for my online banking.  I have several friends whose banking accounts had been hacked.  What a nightmare for them...so I recommended they switch to Bitdefender.

Geoff Granger,2,5,
Whirlwind,24,1,"For Bitdefender: This is the Bitdefender Support 2018081416510001 reference I was given when trying to ask for a refund. My original request was about a week ago when I spoke to someone on the phone who wouldn't refund me, then I got an email several days later, again refusing a refund but telling me I could choose from 2 different discount options. I emailed back to say I didn't want a discount rather I wanted a refund and am still waiting to hear back.Company refuses to refund my subscription despite the fact that I logged into my account prior the auto-renewal and unchecked it to ensure I did not end up with another year's subscription. I have tried repeatedly to ask for a refund and just get the run around telling me they cannot process it, someone will call, someone will get in touch etc.  The worst and most disgusting part is that they refuse to acknowledge the fact that I had unchecked the auto-renewal box and insist that I must pay them trying to act nice by saying they will give me a discount. I do not want a discount, I did not auto-renew, I have not activated my subscription. I have tried phone calls and emails to customer support and just keep getting put off. I just want Bitdefender to refund my full amount after they illegally charged my credit card. That is it!! Bitdefender customer service who reads this - I can't reply through this site. The fact that this has happened not once but several times now with several points of contact shows that you have a very broken sales process system and it is not right that I should have to post on Trustpilot simply for you to make an attempt to put this right. And what is this 30 day money back guarantee? Do you even honour that? You won't even honor my multiple requests to refund a subscription that I never asked for nor even activated? How dare you tell your consumers they have a money back guarantee on your website when your customer service department has told me many times that they do not allow refunds."

Michael Clary,1,5,"Initially I was just in the market to buy the absolute best antivirus software I could find, and I did, but I also got something that I wasn't expecting - the absolute best customer service that I have ever experienced from any software company, let alone an antivirus software company.Now there is real value;  having an excellent product and an equally excellent customer service team to back it up.Easy choice. You just can't go wrong with Bitdefender.Michael Clary"
Mihaitai,1,5,The best Antivirus ever! Great support! :D
R Chase,1,5,Bitdefender Total Security is comprehensive in its protection and associated utilities. Backing it up is a very responsive Customer Service.
Steve Davies,21,5,"I have Total Security together with the premium VPN option. Having used Bitdefender for some years I have found it effective, simple to configure, Always scoring highly in tests and excellent value when compared with possible competitors. My experience of the software combined with very good customer service (on the few times I've had to use them) has convinced me there is very little point in looking anywhere else"

Mike,2,5,"I've used Bitdefender for several years, having previously tried a couple of other highly-rated AV programs. This one wins on price, multi-user licensing, light use of resources, and reliability."
Eric S,1,1,1. Purchased Bitdefender 2017 in Feb 2017 with 2 year license. In June 2018 Bitdefender started pushingto upgrade to 2018 version. 2. Even though I never ok'd installing 2018 their software eventually automatically unistalled 2017 andinstalled 2018. This dispite the fact that I had automatic updates turned off.3. One of my machines (Windows 7) crashed after upgrade to 2018 (BSOD).4. Repeated attempts to discover how to prevent automatic upgrade were ignored by support.5. Had to unistall 2018 and reinstall 2017 on more than one occasion.I find it unacceptable to advertise 24 months and only give 17. I find it totally unacceptable that a product manipulate my machine WITHOUT MY CONSENT and potentially destroy data.=======================There does not seem to be a reply button to answer BitDefenderThe ticket is from Chat 2018061500180002.If you want to help just tell me the registry value to change to preventyour software from automatically uninstalling and installing. If you can'tfind that then perhaps the registry value that will push the reminder dateout until 2019.
Barry,2,5,Have had no virus or malware problems since using Bitdefender.
Garry Merrill,1,5,Very happy with the product.... good customer support process... I use the online chat process on a Sunday and got the answers I needed immediately and I liked that I received an auto email transcript of the support call for the record

Remon PhoneCenter,1,5,"Best antivirus ,easy nothing to worried about .it will do automatic what best ."
Suzi Kauffmann,2,5,"My Personal ExpectationsWhen I first purchased Bitdefender, I did a comparison and picked the one with the highest rating.  That is not exactly the way a decision should be made but it was the right one.  I do not want to be disturbed unless I am being hacked or something.  I want my machine protected by a program that knows what is happening out there in cyber space and has the knowledge to keep me away from it.  Don't have to ask me, just do it.  Bitdefender is everything that I expect from security.  I will order up a report and see what's going on when I can.  Otherwise, Bitdefender takes care of everything on its own."
Kimberly,4,5,"Bitdefender is very trustworthy, easy to use, and can protect your devices from all sorts of bad viruses, spyware, ransomware, and everything out there on the internet.  I highly recommend everyone who goes online at some point from any device (PC, smartphone, tablet, etc.) use Bitdefender products.  You will be safe and love using it."
Ross,4,1,"The free antivirus is absolute junk! Amazon, Ebay, Facebook and many more sites that people use on a daily basis are all threats according to this anti-virus suite. It even blocks its own website as a threat! What a joke!"
Lehoo,2,5,I'm using Bitdefender products for many years and I'm very satisfied. I sincerely recommend them to all my friends.
Peter D,1,5,"I am using a Bitdefender antivirus for last 10 years or so, and the reason is that I never had to deal with any malware/viruses, as it was before Bitdefender with other antiviruses software."

Ms BNM,24,1,"Bitdefender scan says Mac is clean when it is notReaders I am attempting to find solution rather be a victim, so please join in so we hold big giant accountable collectively so we get the service we paid for.Bitdefender I installed from apple store. Please read a part apple review as your scan says my Mac is clean when it is not.Please find a way to stop hackers pop up which locks my computer or click. Please develop something that to stop shut computers to upgrade as they done with mine. I will give you five star once my Mac is clean. Please read below to find solution.Someone is playing “cat & mouse” game where I am the “mouse”. It works then blocked but unable to remain unblocked. Trustpilot is not immune. I have sent them evidence as it has become nightmare to put reviews.Here is my evidence Since last new operating system installed by apple store nothing was installed , as wrote earlier having problem with emails & so forth. I started to avoid Apple upgrades but now thought will do & also installed virus protection. After activating upgrade from apple store my computer shut down,  With computer shut down upgrading took place, then it did not switch back,  I have to restart  when pop  password came, after that security fire/vault poped up & gave 2 choices to iCloud  to remember password or  key numbers. I picked code. Pop up flashed key numbers which did not give me time to write but disappeared. Nothing else popped up to activate. I have written before I found my iCloud key numbers were listed  previously . Apple claims it does not remember iCloud  password so how come my numbers were listed in my MAC. This time numbers are flashed for others to copy but not for me to use. My files are now only can be saved in iCloud & download.Apple must explain how their own upgrade from the apple store has infected my computer once again &  not for my benefit.Another example:After much struggle I was going to publish Thames Water Trustpilot review. I kept pressing button to submit but window remain. I presumed unable to submit.  Then pop up came informing that it will take time to publish & will be notified by email. After I close the Trustpilot window to submit review, underneath there was Trustpilot window already published review with time. It is clear from above example that window informing me it will publish later was from the hacker.My email work & then blocked, worked again along with other issues too  even pages.My Bitdefender & malware remover says computer is clean."
Curtis Wilson,1,5,How many great antivirus software companies make themselves available to customers 24/7?  Customer service is 2nd to none!
Tasos Grigoriadis,10,5,"If you want secure payments on internet, never to get infected from viruses malwares or being attacked from hackers, this is the only way to go. Grab yourself a year subscription with a reasonable price for the features and protection you get. I also had an issue with malfunctioning on my smartphone, the support section immediately responded to my problem also helped me fix it via emails and online chat. Totally worth your money if you want to be safe once and for all without worrying about hackers online phising attacks malwares and viruses. Easy to use very fast scanning, everyday the program updates automatically for new threats. Cheers 👍😉🍺👌👌"

Алексей Миханошин,1,5,This is a really good choice for the comprehensive protection of your data.
David King,1,5,After many years of trouble free use. I had  a  need to give a review . By a mistake I posted that review to a place that does not reply to any emails posted to it. This was my fault not theirs; I did how ever receive a reply and an offer for assistance. Both the response time and effort to resolve my issue was by far beyond that which I expected. I have switched from Windows to mac and found the downloading and installation trouble free. I have had no trouble with using the program since the install however that is only a short time ago. I must say from past and present experience I don't expect any in the future.Take care Dave
Richard,1,5,A great product that works!Any problems I've had have been dealt with rapidly.
Michael Whybro,3,5,The very best product & support of this type of software in the entire market.   Love the ease & certainty provided by BitDefender!

John Campbell,1,5,"Great support, very easy to use, very effective and a lot of fantastic features."
Gary Jenkinson,2,1,"Be aware that the latest versions of Bitdefender can't be installed on Win XP or Win 10 mobile phones.Bitdefender don't make this clear, in fact I only discovered this after I'd bought it, so wasted my money as it was incompatible with 3 of the 5 devices I bought this software for."
Michel De Bruin,1,5,"Excellent value. Used it for many years, and do keep up with reviews of similar products on yearly basis, product hard to beat in tests so never felt need to change.. keep it up!"
Panos Filippakos,1,5,"I've tried in the past many other alternative products, and I believe that Bitdefender is consistently the best Internet security product, year after year."
Mitch Baylis,4,1,Terrible customer service.I wanted to cancel my subscription so I tried doing it online with my account. There is no button there to do it.So I contacted support and after 20 mins of chat about special deals to renew etc (I just wanted to cancel but they didn't seem to understand that!) they said that I was in the wrong department of I wanted to cancel. Seems like they could do everything but cancel my subscription.So I contacted the other department. Again I got a bunch of offers to renew at lower prices and other deals. I told the guy I wanted to cancel 3 times before he actually cancelled my subscription.Clearly this company is losing massive revenue as everything shifts to the cloud and no one needs their software anymore. They are desperately clasping into the few accounts that are left.I used to be a big fan and their software certainly works. But you don't need it when everything is in the cloud and all the apps are on websites. Wasted 2 hours trying to cancel my subscription. Almost gave up and was just going to cancel my card. That would have been easier and less hassle.
Antonio,2,5,"Excellent antivirus and service, I recommend Bitdefender to anyone."
Prabhakar Handique,2,5,Completely satisfied. This is the first time I have purchased an antivirus and my purchase hasn't gone waste. Very happy with both the app and customer support.
John MacFarlane,1,5,The customer care department is very polite and helpful with any problem that needed to be solved.
Leon de Klerk,2,5,"Over the years I have tried all the Antivirus products on offer, but none of them gave me confidence that my PC is safe from attacks. Bitdefender has been safeguarding all my devices for more than 10 years and I will never look back. I removed viruses from friends' PC's which their AV programmes did not even detect and saved them from serious infections. In the meantime I've converted countless friends and family from their useless antivirus providers to Bitdefender and the feedback has always been 120% positive. Thank you Bitdefender for a great product. I would recommend to anyone."
Florin Basciengievici,1,5,Bitdefender Antivirus helped me deal with many malware problems that I encountered since I use it. With the help of support team from Bitdefender I managed to solve problems not only malware issues related but with my operating system also. Now I'm using the internet with confidence that I'm protected.Thank you!

Laurence  Magowan,2,5,"Great Product and great customer service, Keeps your computer safe and if you do run into a problem the customer service team responds very quickly. Would definitely recommend."
Ray Stanborough,1,5,"I have been using this for about 10 years now and I am very happy, it has blocked nasty websites more than once, I believe that is now where the main threats come from, for the average user on the internet."
Wiloxe,1,5,I cannot say if it's security is up to par with other top anti-virus but I can say the support is great and UI is user friendly with great price. I can only say I am hopeful for this.
D.Moore,1,5,Best Buy put Bitdefender Internet Security on my laptop when I bought it and it was my first introduction to it.  Bitdfender has great features such as Safepay and has an easy to use interface - I much preferred to the other anti-virus and internet security software I have used previously.  I have been using if for 3 years without any problems whatsoever and I will be renewing it for another 3 years.
David Gladwin,4,3,"Was once a fan of bitdefender i would use it all the time but since the 2018 edition does not seem to be as good as previous versions something does not seem right when using it and scanning, did a little test and scanned my computer with bitdefender and came up with 0 problems after scan. then ran a virus scanner with a different company's visus scanner and came up with 20+ problem resultsThe old version used to detect malware and spyware but the 2018 verion seems to only be searching for viuses and not other things that could hinder your computers performance so i gave this 3 stars as it does what it says but compared to other years versions does not seem as good"
John Malipiarambil,1,5,"The best antivirus I have used till date. Very, very effective in spam/virus/malware detection. Works like a charm, without draining the computer's memory."
Steve Scheiderer,1,1,"One “star” is to too good for this horrible product, its support and the company. If you have an issue, it takes weeks to get a response (often only if you poke and prod) and months to get a solution (IF there is a solution). When I was not opening support tickets to find out the status of my support tickets, I spent HOURS gathering logs, etc. that are either ignored or not given much of a priority (as was the case with the quirky VPN and slow product updates). On 6/12/18 I got a response to the topic of their poor customer service: “We have fixed the issues that led to this delay therefore we hope to assist you in a timely fashion from now on.” I sent a follow-up question on 6/12 that was NOT replied to for over 2 weeks (at which time I requested a refund). Some “fix”!One feature that I could NOT rely on was the so-called “anti-theft” feature. That app only works IF you are logged onto the phone. It has been five months since I opened that support ticket and the online portal still says: “We are working to locate your device.” In another place it says misleadingly: “Device Name … Pretty green checkmark … Protected No security risks”. I lost my phone recently and I had to use the iPhone app. Their support admits: “Our development department investigated the matter related to Anti-Theft on iOS 11 and due to the restriction of the operating system it can be localized only when the app is opened as only then it can communicate with the server.” Obviously a lost or stolen phone would not be accessible to use the app (unless you find your phone [duh!] or ask the thief to log on for you).Some FREE products are better alternatives to this product’s so-called bells and whistles. For example, the Wallet is VERY difficult to use when compared to other products (see Dashlane). To sort on URL, rather than nickname, is almost worthless. Sorting on the following lead words in URLS are examples: account, investor, login, member, online, personal, portal, secure, sign in, verified, watch, etc. Safepay is VERY slow compared to other products (see Opera browser). The product’s updates are VERY slow compared to my new product (F-Secure, through my ISP). They do offer to extend your subscription each time their support fails or they can’t fix an issue, but what good is that if the product doesn’t work and timely support is lacking?"
KDM,2,1,Will take over as gatekeeper of your computer ..... very difficult if not impossible to uninstall.  Why would that be????  You have no control once you let these people in.  Customer service is horrendous to nonexistent.  Have problems?  Your only hope is to call their corporate headquarters 954-776-6262.
Barry Marks,2,5,I have only had this software for a short time but it has already stopped several attempts to penetrate my computer. There is also a backup of a great support team should you have a problem like I had and this was resolved very quickly.
Disney Rocaldo,1,5,The best Internet security I have ever tried!
Krishnamurthy Subramanian,1,4,I have tried many anti virus products in the last 20 years starting from Nortan. I have conclusively positive experience with BitDefender and I would say this is the best of all.
Arif Badar,1,5,Silent security without hogging down on resources. Minimal disk usage. No false positives. I personally don't find a difference in snappiness of PC before and after installing Bitdefender.
Mel,1,5,"Great product! By far the most superior product on the market. Easy to use, control and navigate. Experienced one issue with an application being blocked, this was immediately resolved by the support team. Highly recommend this product"

Vesna,1,4,"I'm not expert enough to know how good the product really is (Antivirus 2018), but the online chat support is first class - friendly, fast and accurate. They sorted my problems precisely at the first attempt each time - very encouraging that the firm really cares for the customer."
Georgiana,10,5,"I feel safe with BitDefender protecting my devices and I know, from experience, that if I have an issue with something, the professional Support Team will have it solved quickly and efficiently. I definitely recommend it!"
Mark Tinney`,1,5,"There is no better anti-virus/anti-malware/anti-ransomware product on the market today. BD ranks neck and neck as best (depending on the lab and the tests) technically with Kaspersky, AhnLabs, and Avast but is far easier to use and is the only one of those to regularly beat out Day Zero attack. I strongly urge everyone with a PC or Mobile Device to install and use Bitdefender."
Robert,1,5,"Bitdefender technical supports far exceeds that offered by other entities,Most companies support is a bit of an ox-y-moron.I have recommended Bitdefender to others.Robert P Worst"
Thomas,1,5,"Bitdefender provides excellent customer service for numerous reasons. First, it offers a telephone number (local) to speak to a representative. Second, the customer service representative was professional and explained the reason for each action he instructed me to perform. Third, the Bitdefender representative had me test the ""fix"" that we achieved in order to ensure that it was permanent. Most impressive was that the Bitdefender representative spent as much time as necessary to resolve my issue; I did not feel rushed. Finally, the Bitdefender was knowledgeable about various web-browsers and their features. Great value."
Jonelle Patrick,1,1,"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO BITDEFENDER. They engage in seriously scammy business practices.I am a Bitdefender subscriber, and a week ago I received an email notice that they had toggled my preferences to auto-renew at the end of my subscription period. I tried to access my account to change that, only to find that my password didn’t work anymore. I contacted them and was referred to Avangate.com (2Checkout), a reseller I had never dealt with. Both support teams have been giving me the runaround for a week, sending upsell emails, referring me back and forth between them, recommending courses of action that didn’t work, then claiming that my issue was “resolved.” If they don’t actually give me access to my account and payment information by the date they tell me it will auto-renew, I will dispute the charge, but I would like to spare other users the  experience of dealing with their dishonest practices and misuse of user information.Edit update: In case you read Bitdefender's reply and are tempted to believe it's that easy to extricate yourself from the clutches of their ""official partner that deals with all our financial side of business,"" please check out the Trustpilot reviews of Avangate. Spoiler: so many reasons to give a company one star. No wonder they're ""rebranding"" to 2Checkout. I stand by my review, and hope nobody else gets sucked into this black hole."
Mr Ted Stone,9,4,Had it less then one year.  So far I am very pleased.

Entech,11,5,"Works well and customer service is first class, definitely recommended."
Liviu Corneliu Pop,1,5,"I recommend Bitdefender because of its efficiency, accuracy, responsiveness and simplicity."
James Stokes,1,5,"I have enjoyed my usage of the Bitdefender Total Security software so far. I have used it for about a week.The program has fulfilled its main purpose very well. It has detected a handful of viruses that I was unaware of at the time. I also like the user interface, especially how clean the appearance of the graphics are shown.However, there are a couple things I feel could be improved. I have not detracted any stars from my review because I don't feel like they have had any negative effect so far, plus the issues I noticed are also not related to the main function of the program which is to detect malware and viruses.The first is that I cannot see a way to disable the startup optimizer. At the moment I already have a program that allows me to control the startup programs and disable or delay them. In addition to that, when I did test the startup optimizer I found that if I put a program in the delayed or disabled category that when the computer restarted that the programs were no longer on the list. I feel that there should be a tab I can click to see the delayed and disabled startup programs.Thirdly, I found that if I clicked on an item that was closer to the bottom, that my view would immediately snap back to the top of the page. That made it so that I had to scroll right back down each time I selected the next program in the list so that I could determine if the program would be delayed or disabled."
Warren Horowitz,1,5,"You either have Bitdefender or you’re screwed... it’s really that simple. When my BD goes off and catches something I feel confident that it’s working and doing what it’s supposed to. It’s a good feeling when something works as promised I bought two years worth after my first year was up for renewal.If you don’t got BD, you’re going to get something else you don’t want!Warren (Come and get me) Horowitz"
Ulises Guzman,1,5,"Since I installed Bitdefender, I truly feel safe, it really helps protecting my computer from malicious software.   Besides, I had to change computers so I needed assistance to pass the program to my new computer and the response was almost inmediately. Thank you"
Chris,1,1,"Buyer beware!  Though the product is effective the licensing scheme is just a rip off.  I bought a one license pack for $19.95 and set up auto-renew.  next renewal i got charged $39.99 for the same single license when they are advertising the same price for a 3 license pack.  They treat their existing customers poorly in deference to new customers.  Developed in Romania so treatment of customers seems like they employ ex soviet tactics.  i need another Windows license and a MAC license but will now look elsewhere because they triple the price for that.  Sad, if they were just flexible and honest i would increase my commitment."
Paolo Savo,3,5,"Products, support and prices all good."
Brant Dufty,1,5,I have used Bitdefender Total Security for about 4 yrs and I have never had my computer get any virus or malware. Anytime Windows Update has caused a problem (twice in 4 yrs). Bitdefender  Support online guided me through the steps I need to take to fix it. Uninstall and reinstall bitdefender which took all of 5mins. It is easy to use a great price and excellent customer service and support!!!
ben t. s.,1,1,"purchased 1pc, 3yrs antivirus 2 days ago on Ebay.  the worse AV I have ever used!  how should I say this...  it's like stupid, annoying children of the company owner that one can't fire - every five second, ""boss look, loo9k what I just have done for you... blah, blah, blah..""1. set off siren, loud enough to sent my sleeping dogs jumped out of the window! what is it about?

THOMAS E. F. TESTA,1,5,"''I'M TOM TESTA FROM HARLINGEN, TEXAS.  I HAD THE PLEASURE IN RECENT DAYS TO INTERACT BY PHONE WITH CHRISTIAN, JAMES, AND MAXIMUS OF 'BITDEFENDER' CUSTOMER SUPPORT --- PLUS I EMAIL-INTERACTED SEVERAL TIMES WITH VICTORIA LUPO, ALSO A MEMBER OF THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT TEAM.  EACH INTERACTION WAS A DELIGHT!  THESE 4 STAFFERS REALLY 'LOVE BOMBED' ME WITH MAX-ATTENTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  THEY CERTAINLY DESERVE AND HAVE EARNED A 5/5 RATING!  TOM.''"
Delphine Larkins,1,5,"I would recommend this company because they offer complete coverage. If problems occur, they will not stop until the situation is resolved."
"Joseph L Brincat, Malta",5,5,Bitdefender is a very efficient Internet Security program nad is backed by a very helpful Customer service.
Dejan Misic,1,5,All is very good except the fact that the use if Bitdefender make my PC slower.
Ankit Pal,1,5,"It's been one year since i am using total security. upto now no virus or phishing attacks, the system works fast and accurate. it is more better than kaspersky or any other antivirus sofware."
Stewart Warrender,3,5,"As I'm not particularly IT savvy, I depend upon having a good anti virus protection for my IT tools, mainly Laptop. Being able to contact the service provider for advice and general enquiries is a necessary option for my limited knowledge. When I've contacted them, their responses have been very quick, understanding and I would classify this in particular as nothing less than excellent"
Lesley,3,5,"Bitdefender is a brilliant protection for computers, laptops and mobile devices. I have used it for many years on several devices. This year I bought Antivirus Plus but then decided I wanted to go back to Total Security. Customer service changed this over remotely for me with no extra cost. The reps were superb and answered my emails promptly. I can't recommend Bitdefender enough."
Rosen gekov,1,5,Best security solution!!!
Heather Kelley,10,5,"Had a bit of a problem with Bitdefender to start with, got through immediately to a wonderful customer service young man, who resolved with ease all my issues,"
Brittany,1,1,They will automatically renew you and charge your credit card. They also will not respond to emails and keep sending you new ones on updates to things you did not purchase.
P. VdB,8,4,"a very good product, but as you can read about everywhere:problem 1 : uninstalling not easyproblem 2: autorenewal shouldn't be actif it is kind of agressif, just give this option in the centralproblem 3: it's true that the answering  clientservice is very automatedproblem 4: more explications on the differences off the products which all look alike... Your product is the one off the best, and the VPN premium works fine for me, but also needs more explications on your website about whether you keep logs, the system,etc"
Peter,4,5,"The software protection gives peace of mind and when I had a question, the customer support was fast, courteous and very helpful."
Brian Kellock,1,5,"the software is always one of the best in independent testing. I've used it for years. The one time I needed customer support, it was fast and very helpful."
Galyn Shaw,1,2,"My automatic renewal should have taken effect on June 1, 2018.  My credit card was charged and the company website shows that my coverage has been extended for another year.  I have exchanged emails with company service on three occasions and each time my questions have not been answered.  Instead, I receive messages that my membership has been extended under old email account which I no longer have.  No one has taken the time to address my questions so the problem may be resolved.  I am extremely disappointed with the company's service department and will no longer be doing business with them!"
Don Clayton,54,5,"Bitdedefender is on Trust Pilot? Cool I'm a member of this site. Will put the Bitdefender review on my ""2-Do"" list."
Kerrin Beckwith,1,1,"Terrible experience with the free version, uninstalling seems nigh on impossible requiring a separate program to delete it which is beyond stupid."
Søren Klype,2,5,"Easy overlooked user interface thay do the job without any concerns for the safety. It's light and fast with comprehensive information in every step. Though i'm not a typical power user, i have had years of experience with different safetysuites from different company's, and there's a reason for my 5 years long commitment to Bitdefender. That's the level of safety"
Gordon,4,5,I like that it operates almost 'invisibly and silently' in the background and yet provides excellent protection shown by looking at the logs.
henrik,42,1,"In january an bitdefender update blocked me from using my WDMyCloud, I got in the start of Marts. No one tried to help me at all before I had complained on Facebook. It started again in the beginning of May, and again the support didn't help. I was asked create a logfile, with a hidden software from Bitdefender, I can prove I send that logfile, but Bitdefender claims I didn't and I had to send it again a week later. after 3 days they told me, they where still investigating. But after a week, I had enough. The first solution from Bitdefender was to create a costum rule, which we allready had in Marts. Then I had to delete that rule and create another. But that was just solution number 5, and I knew this would start again, and I was right. Today, the second level support asked for more time to investigate. But 6 month in to my subscription period, I have had it, and I have deleted my account, because I refuses to use a securitysoftware that blocks me on my LAN, and I refuses to be a costumer and a user, with a company which has a support that don't care."
Ray Butterworth. ANPHO. Secretary,4,5,"With my experience of using Bitdefender Total Security for over 10 years, I would have no doubts in recommending this product for peace of mind."
Edward King-Oakley,12,5,Excellent product and quick support that was polite and to the point.
Albert33,3,1,"Although their software is average to decent, their customer support is terrible! Every mail and live chat session resulted in the same copy paste answers without any meaning. It has been a month now and I still haven't recived my refund which they confirmed! According to Paypal, they have not started the refunding proces. This makes me believe these guys are scammers, watch out!"
Dave Lainton,5,5,"I switched to Bitdefender just over two years ago. Following a reasonably low grade virus attack on my PC I decided to purchase some new software. After some relatively lengthy research I concluded my needs (PC, Laptop, 2 Mobiles & 2 Tablets) would be best met by a Bitdefender licence for 5 devices. My current updated version is Bitdefender Total Security 2018 with the addition of VPN Premium. Since installing the software in late 2016 I've had no further problems with viruses or other malware or attacks on any of my devices. The Bitdefender Wallet facility which protects ALL my Login IDs and passwords is a great part of the package. I would have no hesitation recommending these products to any household with similar needs who uses the internet to shop, bank, email and blog."
David Forder,1,5,Good value high performance malware protection easy to use
Michael Resch,1,5,"In my Experience, Bitdefender is an Outstanding Software Company in the Areas of Antivirus, Antimalware, Antispam & the Enhancement of PC Performance, to name but a Few.  My Primary Example has been with their Product: Bitdefender 2018, in a Windows 10 Pro Version 1803 Environment.  It has Demonstrated the Capability to Out-Perform the Windows Defender Security System which is Included in Windows 10 Pro by a Large Margin.  It has also Demonstrated the Capability to Enhance PC Performance with it's Easily User Configured Operation Profiles, by Allowing the User to Determine which Apps will receive Priority CPU Utilization, resulting in a Dramatically Improved Responsiveness of the OS, especially for 64 bit Apps in an X64 Environment.  Additionally, I have Experienced the Fact that their Product Technical Support is in a Class by Itself with regards to Timely, Professional Support & Solutions for Complex Problems which may arise in a Real-World PC Software Environment.  I Personally Rely on Bitdefender 2018 to keep my PC Safe from the Multiple Hostile Threats which exist on today's Internet both in my Work and Personal Activities with my PC."
Raymond,4,5,"Have been using Bitdefender for a long time, Only had a problem 1 time and support worked  hadr and fast to get it resolved, Best support service I have ever dealt with,I think Bitdefender is 1 of the best there is, To me they are the best wist best support"
Kansas Fitzgerald,1,5,Bitdefender offers incredible feature-rich end use Anti-Virus software that is extremely comfortable for anyone to use and learn. They also had some of the best and responsive customer  service I've ever used. Chat with them was simple and very instructive to get my issues resolved.
aniket sharama,1,4,It's worth trying. Good products and nice services.One of the best in sybersecurity.
Jam Kay,2,4,"Bitdefender is remarkably rich in features which are easily accessible from its rather compact user interface. All of it is easy to understand and easy to use.For a home user, the cost is remarkably low as they allow you to install it on ALL of your applicable devices. There is no apparent limit.As for negatives, there is only one major one: a surprisingly large number (over 30) of my files were quarantined with vague information about this or that virus or malware. The flagging was inconsistent across my different systems, included entirely reliable software from Amazon and Microsoft, and especially annoying, some of my own personally written software was flagged. Even some simple data files were flagged. I spent a lot of time with their tech support, but they never produced any apparent resolution. I had to manually 'whitelist' each file.A minor problem is with the weekly report that merges data from all of my covered systems: I get a number that says how many threats were 'fixed' but I have not found any way to determine exactly which system and file were involved. So the report is basically useless."
Dominic Karunanayake,1,1,Bought bit defender after reading much hype about this product. This slows down the computer totally. Had to even white list Gmail account before was able to access mail.When ever trying to log into online banking vpn starts in the middle of doing transactions. It would have been okay if this secure vpn started as soon as you try logging in to internet banking. Regret alot stopping my trend Micro antivirus Hugely unsatisfied
MichaelBK,1,5,Their product is second to none and the phone support they offer is very professional.
Dawn Gloeckler,6,5,One of the best security software for the price!
Kamrul Hasan,1,5,Lite and does not hamper the system speed. Good for low profile hardware. Various kind of features. I like it personally.
D J Dobie,2,5,Prompt efficient friendly customer support.
Siddharth Kumar,3,5,"The best Antivirus in the industry with 100% detection rate and ability to eliminate 100% virus. Have all the features, easy to use for novice, and even include vpn and ransomware protection."
Keith Wilson,3,5,Great software and great customer service
Farhad,1,5,You will no longer see any threat by using bitdefender.
Gabriel Pelmus,1,5,It is the best security product I ever used. It does everything you need from such a product and has a really low impact on the system.
JAMAL AHMAD,1,5,
Martin Bernleithner,1,5,I've been using Bitdefender Internet Security for a number of years and I can honestly say that they are far superior than some of the other Internet Security software providers I've used in the past. It's impact on my PC's resources are minimal and I find that it's very intuitive. The only downside is that they no longer support older versions of Windows OS (XP & Vista).
Stan,1,5,Have had no problems for the 4 years I have been using. Great customer service
Big_Sleepyhead,1,4,"Used for many years - great product. Total Security covers all devices within home quickly and easily across platforms. These folks helped quickly with my auto renewal concerns or issues in a very excellent manner - impressed with their response. One caveat - Bitdefender really needs to fix the 'automatic renewal' feature so it is turned off to start. This is 2018 folks and greater transparency is warranted. Customers don't need to be tricked into buying, you got a great product. Let people re-subscribe based on your good work and quality - just send a notice. Consider to add an auto-renewal on off switch in the customers sign-in page."
Russ Deane,1,5,"One of the few that uses advanced heuristics and pattern recognition to minimise susceptibility to zero day events.Excellent features in setting safe file areas that require permission to allow changes.  Safe banking/payment features, and wallet.Web and App protection plus tools for optimisation and anti theft.Error reporting on various levels with ability to override blockages.VPN without logging as an option."
brett,1,1,"As an antivirus bitdefender 2018 works well, stopping pretty much all viruses and not using to many computer resources. But as a whole, it  is the most restrictive and frustrating anti virus i have ever used. It stops many programs from functioning correctly and i have to refresh web pages so often when its installed because the pages stop loading half way through. It prevents me from downloading some programs I know are safe and even when I add them to bitdefenders exclusions the next time I go to use the program, it deletes them anyway, making for a very frustrating experience.Talking to support didn't take to long to get through and the people were polite but they are very strict on the 30 day refund period even if you are only asking for a partial refund with the full uninstall key.Bitdefender 2018 would probably be ok for people who only use their computers for surfing the web but for any other users I would highly recommend looking elsewhere."
Michael Fitzgerald,1,5,Bitdefender's representative Radu Mihail made it very easy for me to resolve my issue. He gave me a short-cut which was less complicated than the original instructions I had been given to send the support tool log for analysis.
Tuấn Anh Nguyễn,1,5,Highy effective at a reasonable cost. Just keep in mind that Bitdefender has different sales policy at different countries. So customers may purchase a version of Bitdefender at a much lower fee from local distributors than from their main website. 5 stars!
Darla Lamb,1,5,"In my opinion, Bitdefender is the better antivirus. It includes software for viruses, malware, secure banking browser, password wallet, It is not heavy on resources, works silently without the user needing to do anything, unless major issues arise. With different profiles available, it can be set up to recognize resources needed and delays less important services. I have been using a paid subscription for a few years and highly recommend. They have apps for mobile devices, and a Central site to manage ge your devices remotely. A1 customer service, and pricing is great, with multiple device protection included. I highly recommend it."
Daniel,1,5,"Great response from customer support, friendly and professional attitude. Good user interface with simplistic approach to settings, usable by users of all categories."
Lyes chaouch,1,5,"All products being equal, customer service would make the difference!"
Huw Williams,2,5,Very easily installed. Excellent user interface.A very comprehensive suite of security tools.Performs better than McAfee which I used earlier.A very reasonable price for all which the tool offers.The addition of the VPN to the suite is highly recommended.
Viktor,3,4,"I like Bitdefender Total Security products. The only thing I don't like is the price policy. You have to deactivate automatic license extension on purchasing a product (in your shopping card click the link to deactivate it), because an automatic extension will cost you more money, than a normal purchase over the website. Sometimes you get nice price offers per e-Mail and it is better if you use them instead of heaving automatic license extension.The service is very responsive. If you don't get your product installed for some reason, you can ask, if they can extend your license period for at least for the time, you needed support."
Peter Jones,1,5,
Sujit Rawat,2,5,"When i was looking for internet security there were bunch of internet securities out there, i was really confuse which one should i go for.I finally chose this one, i was really worried about it, about its function, and all but after using it i was really happy. It is great in almost all aspects. KUDOS."
Albert May,1,5,Bitdefender is the best security app out there. I had great all-round experience especially since my phone is used by my children the app lock is a great feature in this regard. Thanks for your business. Albert
Rick Stafford,1,5,Fast and effective computer security that works without causing extreme system resource slow down
Sophie Bagley,5,5,I cannot fault the speed & quality of response to queries from a customer who is not particularly computer literate
Paul,7,2,PaulI opened a ticket last week 2018042919070001 and after more than 48 hours the issue with slowing down my Desktop internet speed haven't been resolved. I opened other ticket today for VPN 2018050711050003 slowing down my Desktop interned speed from 85 Mbmps to 15 Mbps. They onely have 24 hours from now to resolve this issue. If both tickets will not be resolved I will cancel their products and request a full refund. No more excuses with emails.
A.  MEANS,1,5,"Bitdefender products has worked great since first introduced, because of the quality of Bitdefender products and services I've had any need to use different. Why change or replace your tools when there's any need to do so?"
Johan,15,1,"Worst antivirus and security program I have ever had. Errors and ridiculous warnings when you disable their useless autopilot. Intrusive. Stops legal actions like copying files to the desktop and connecting to trusted ftp. Adding allow rules etc does not help. I got it because of good reviews and better price than some competitors, but you obviously get what you pay for. Horrificly bad program."
Mahdi,1,5,
Hansen Yonathan Firdaus,1,5,"The best anti-virus I've ever bought. It gives very good protection while not slowing down your system. It also has other features like vulnerability scan which I use often, one-click optimizer, etc. It's only available on total security though."
Robert Firestone,1,5,"It works.  Aside from the difficulty in actually getting a technician to call me back,  Every one of them who I do speak with knows what they are doing."
Robert Brule,2,5,Best rating in the world for the last 7 years
Luke Blunden,1,2,"Had it for 2 years, auto renewal went ahead for the 3rd year when i noticed i was being charged for 2 different subscriptions. Some investigtion showed i had also been charged twice last year. Got a refund for the money spent this year but didn't get the 3rd year that i'd paid for. No acknowledgement from bitdefender on the extra year I'd paid or the fact that it was impossible to see this double subscription within bitdefefender central which I would consider a serious flaw and to be quite disapointing considering the product itself is good."
David,1,5,Bitdefender works as promised on my home computers. It is reasonably priced and responds to their client when needed.

Szymon Bretner (XenoksPL),1,1,"Installed Bitdefender recently, been playing Enderal today for about 2 hours. After relaunching the game all my saves from today have disappeared, it turns out that Bitdefender blocked the game from saving files to it's respective folder in Documents thus I lost all my progress from those 2 hours. 10/10 would install again."

Wanda Jays,3,5,"I tried the trial version of bitfender for Mac and was so impressed that I purchased it. It took me a few years to come to the decision to put anti virus on my Macbook pro and at first I installed McAfee Live Safe because I have it on my Windows and Android devices and it works fine on them, but not on my Macbook. So after seeing reviews I switched to Bitfender. I am absolutely delighted with Bitfender. It runs in the background doing its job and not slowing down my Macbook at all."

Bev Whalan,1,4,I had so much trouble with my bitdefender internet  security 2018 it slowed everything down big time.  I went to utube and got a tutorial about the firewall and connecting my wifi through it.  Since i have done that i am having no problems what so ever.
Vande...,7,2,Resume: I bought Bitdefenders  and it is very disappointing. It is not a steady protection to my computers because of bugs with internet connection to Bitdefender central. The problem is that it stops the antivirus protection because software puts the status of expired products. It does not realize that the long-term  plan i bought is still active...more than 3 years more over my 4 years plan! And i can't correct it because the central bit defender website says everything is OK... is fine ( I still have 1125 DAYS!)NEW INFOit seems that Bitdefender has correct the bug with a new version. I will test it
simon tafe,2,1,"This product is terrible. It blocks absolutely everything. Blocks internet access, network access and a lot of software.Tech support is awful. They take weeks to respond and ask for log files. It takes weeks to hear again but instead of helping they ask for log files again. Overall it is the worst antivirus software I have ever used."

Marty Silverman,2,5,Complete product with great customer service.
Mark Blodgett,1,1,"After installing Bitdefender on my 64bit Windows 8.1 laptop, my 32bit Internet Explorer 11 keeps freezing up! Sometimes after 1 minute, 3 minutes, etc...totally random. I now have to use Firefox Quantum and I hate their version of SmoothScroll and when you turn it off, scrolling REALLY sucks (even after toying with Firefox scroll settings). I want to use my IE. I tried calling customer support here in America, but wat told to GO POUND PAVEMENT. My 3 year subscription was purchased on eBay and, even tho it was an American seller, selling it here in America, it originated from India so I was told to go call India. I can't. My Tracfone doesn't allow international calls. Called Bitdefender back and explained this and, again, was told to GO POUND PAVEMENT. What difference does it make WHERE my Bitdefender originated from? It's STILL Bitdefender, isn't it??? Tried going to ""support"" on the Bitdefender.in website, but it is EMAIL ONLY. Emailed them but, of course, I've never received any reply (sigh).Great. I paid for a 3 YEAR subscription for a product that doesn't work and I now have to throw away. THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT BITDEFENDER!UPDATE: I see the reply from ""Bitdefender Romania"" listed below, but without any phone number, email address nor any other way to reply nor contact them. What exactly am I supposed to do with your reply??? How silly."
Robert,2,5,
Frank Mandal,1,5,I have had no issues with this software. The first issue I had was resolved very easily. I was very happy with the competence of the individual.
Chris Walters,1,5,I could not believe how quick a response I received. Customer Care is there 24/7. I received a quick written instruction on how to resolve my issue. I went through the simple instruction one by one and resolved my issue after the first attempt - all whilst Customer Care waited patiently on the other end.Cannot speak highly enough about the product and true 24/7 support.
Michael J Regan,4,5,"I love the way the BitDefender Suite has an AutoPilot button even though I am very computer savvy. I did a ton of research before picking the best AntiVirus Suite and I follow up with a review every year. So, the fact that I have been using BitDefender for approximately 5 years says a lot about how great their software and most importantly, customer service and care is. Yeah, there are other AntiVirus suites out there, but I prefer the best combination of Product, Reviews and Customer Service that BitDefender provide. I highly recommend you try them out, I'm sure you'll be satisfied."

The purchase interface was UNCLEAR about paying for additional household computers.  BEFORE purchase I called the help center (in India) and was told to chose "" Bitdefender Install & SetUp MultiPlatform"".  This was wrong and cost an additional $40 (in actuality, it costs only $10 but this IS NOT ON THE MAIN MENU).  I called the customer service/chat/help (again in India) that same day of purchase and was told they pass it on to Customer Service.  NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.  The Indian ""help center"" is simply a call center with no apparent supervisors (I asked).  I was sent this information on 4/11/18:""Thank you for contacting Bitdefender Customer Care. This is an automated reply to confirm that we have received your request, and that we are working on resolving your issue(s) as promptly as possible. Your assigned ticket number is 2018041120580004. We advise that you keep this reference number in a safe place for further tracking/follow-up. Regards, Bitdefender Customer Care Team ""4/16/18:  NO response so I called again and asked for a supervisor (refused) and was assured that the priority would be augmented.  I've still heard nothing.  THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE I've had  and would not have purchased it (even thought apparently a good product) if I know about the customer interface.  I hope this helps someone.   AND, BITDEFENDER, if you're actually interested in feedback, I'm not done.  I'm going on to FB, Yelp, Avangate and all my other threads to post the same comments/review.UPDATE: BITDEFENDER support finally got back to me (but only after posting on TRUSTPILOT, I believe).  They refunded 39.95 for the mis-information and unclear order described above AND were very cordial.  Evidently their help center is NOT in India but is in Romania, their home (you could have fooled me).  Because they responded AND refunded I'm moving my rating to 3 STARS."
Markos,13,5,"An efficient program and if you have a problem, as I did, all my contacts with the company, both phone and email were dealt with efficiently and were clear and helpful - it solved the problems I had.Thoroughly recommended. Check the comparison websites and professional assessments!"
Martin Jackson,23,5,Works perfectly in the background without affecting computer performance.
Jaco Kramer,1,1,"New:Ok, the day I placed the below message (see older) I got an immediate response. Since this did not help I replied to that response.And...... again no response till now, 2 weeks later (total 4 yet).However, as it is already 4 weeks ago since my problem occured, I cannot recover anything anymore.Well.... after all it remains a very poor, unefficient, disapointing service, or better: NO SERVICE AT ALL.The most simple webshop is able to answer within a day, an essential anti virus developer not. And when you call them they cannot help you, the only thing they can say that the ticket is under investigation.So people, it might be one of the best anti-virus programs however, they cannot service you, so be aware of this!!.Older:Since Bitdefender came out as the best in tests of our Consumers Association in the Netherlands I decided to buy and skip my McAfee subscription.In the first scan Bitdefender has deleted my outlook.pst file. So all my e-mails are gone.I have made a ticket on the 30th of March however I get no response at all. I phoned twice but they can only say that they have received my ticket and it has their attention.I am now already waiting 2,5 weeks for an answer!I regret that I have bought Bitdefender since the service and helpdesk is worthless.McAfee seems not to be the best but I have received always direct service within half an hour and with bigger problems they takeover.So I am therefore very disappointed and will certainly not recommend anyone to buy Bitdefender, because of the bad service.I will also share my experience with the Consumers Association of which I am a member."
Christian H Glatz,1,5,Best customer service.
Dale Mokrey,3,5,"I've been using computers since 1998 and have tried numerous anti-virus protection products. None of them compare with Bitdefender. This program  catches every problem trying to sneak into both our 2 PCs and 1 Mac.The price is excellent, particularly when covering more than 1 operating system but, best of all, is the prompt and friendly service available. Bit defender's agents are knowledgable, polite and prompt.I would recommend Bitdefender to anyone wanting the best!"
Skip Ehrenstein,1,5,"You have  to try the free version, this will convince to buy the premium version!"
Dave,1,1,"Do not try the free trial. They get you when you want to uninstall it. It is almost impossible for any normal person to uninstall. In my experience, the product itself did not do anything exceptional that a free anti virus, like Avast. wouldn't do."
Ian Watson,5,5,i really like it  it has great security as well as giving a safe place to do your online transactions and their online support is good
A.H.,1,5,Bitdefender is the best System Security Tool on the market!Easy to use! Runs on all systems! THX to the Bitdefender TEAM for their great work!Keep it up!
Rosanna Tarsiero,1,5,"The product is, simply put, excellent. But I want to stress out the high quality of their customer service. The very few times you do have a problem with it, they listen and they coach you through its resolution. And, if a first level resolution isn't feasible, they promptly escalate your case and rapidly follow up. Really the best!"
Denise Dykeman,1,1,They automatically renew you then try and cancel. You get the run around.  Had to cancelMy credit card so I don’t get scammed again
Mazza,16,5,"Great pc protection, with a rapid, well informed customer service department should you require them. Comes with all the features you would expect from a top pc anti virus and internet protection."
Marlene Hunter,2,5,"I purchased BitDefender because of its high security rating. On the one occasion that I needed help from the BitDefender Support Centre, their response was very fast and their clearly explained advice enabled me to fix the problem immediately."
Sabine,1,5,Easy to use even for tech dummies BUT absolutely effective and great customer support
DOKOCHI NDANUSA,1,5,"Bitdefender has put forth an excellent protective platform. It ensures indept user protection, giving the user relaxed mind worry-free online surfing. Keep the excellent work and keep improving."
Roger Hass,2,5,"Without a doubt I consider BitDefender Security solutions to be #1.I Started using BD back in 2000 and have total confidence in the product.At times I may not be happy when they drop support for the Windows XP Pro SP3 and Vista operating systems however currently my 3 year subscription is active on all my Windows operating systems from Windows XP up to Windows 10.Thought for the day, ""No"" is not an answer ☺RegardsRoger Hass / PC-Bug Fixer / Australia"
Fran,1,5,"Bitdefender is a powerful anti-virus with a great VPN and wallet, expert and patient tech staff and efficient customer service."
Dee,1,1,"I installed bitdefender and could not get it to work. Tried to uninstall it and it would not let me. It has a virus build into it so you cannot uninstall, and you must reformat your computer & reinstall windows to get rid of it.  It is a Bucharest, Romania company.  I found other customers that also had this problem. Why would they make it impossible to uninstall."
Coldfire Coldfire,2,5,Second to none virus&antiphising  protection against all type of online threats!
Glenn Franco Simmons,1,5,"I had to reinstall Bitdefender and could not get it to work. I contacted Bitdefender and it told me it was an easy fix. I did exactly as I was told to my computer settings, and Bitdefender loaded without a problem. Bitdefender very quickly responded to my question and its directions to resolve my problem were precise and accurate. I would recommend Bitdefender for anyone. It is a layer of security I would not do without."
Catalin Stanoiu,3,5,I've been using BitDefender for almost 10 years now. I never ever had problems with viruses. Even when a lot of people around me were complaining the had to format their PCs or go through some sort of fix because of an infection.
Fred Stemler,1,1,"I had a problem and contacted Bitdefender support concerning setting the switch for Real-time optimization.  I received an email from an obviously uninformed member of the Bitdefender support team that stated the following:  'Please be informed that our Bitdefender product does not have such a feature named ""Real Time Optimization"".  Let us know if maybe you have confused the feature name or perhaps is is a feature from another application.'  I went to Settings, then Profile.  At the bottom of the window is a switch labeled 'Real-time optimization'.  Bitdefender needs to hire a support team that knows their application better than Vladimir does.  Very poor support!"
andrea wright,1,1,"4 days before my subscription was expiring, I received confirmation from Bitdefender that I was auto renewing.  I was not happy about this and so logged onto my account to cancel auto renewal.  I also at the same time purchased it off their website as they were offering it at a discount.  So I've paid 34.99 and now they have ignored the autorenewal cancellation, tried to take payment from my account and extend my subscription from 369 days to 731 by tagging their auto renewal on the end of the one I authorised.  Now the auto-renewal function has disappeared when logged onto my account so I can't prove that I cancelled it before manually renewing it.  Do not touch them with a barge pole."
Bernie roadshow (Bernies Roadshow),1,5,"Bitdefender total 2018 is excellent easy to use easy for most things works really, really well saves my machine no worries. i tried avg once and it cost me down time and 6 weeks work in rebuilding the workstation and loss of data and our business was down for most of the 6 weeks, i tried some of the others norton its an infestation of your machine fails badly can't unistall it, same as mcafee can't remove it all even after you uninstall the above there are still bit running even after you remove the main program. tried sophos cost to much (it more industrial) moved to Bitdefender NO issues, No problems, No dramas, tech support is brilliant, and for one cost you get 5 machines licences included its reasonable cost what more could you ask for, i did the workstation, tablet, phone, and 2 laptops simple and the option of a VPN client. it had to be done"
Colin Scheelar,1,5,Excellent work from the Customer Service Rep.  Very methodical and well experienced.  Tried the obvious first then worked the the more complex.I would recommend bitdefender products.This is the first time I needed to contact customer service in about 4 years of using Bitdefender.Would recommend this company and I feel they have a top notch product.
Bill Buehler,1,5,A good lite weight antivirus I have used and recommended for years.
Inge Jonsson,6,5,"Trouble-free, good support, high ratings in reviews. Using it on three computers and my Android phone."
Semi Yulianto,1,5,A Total Security for your everyday needs. Very recommended!
chiko hodgert,12,5,Good customer service and easy to operate
yashar,3,5,- Excellent customer service- High quality for price- useful features as well as a VPN service
Pierre J. Deschênes,1,1,"Customer service is simply non-existent. I wanted to transfer the service from my old cell to my new cell. I have succeeded to register my new phone but impossible to remove the old one. However it was  very simple to add the new cell at an extra cost.I have sent a demand by mail for service and after 4 days no answer. I have tried to reach the customer service by phone. Impossible,  I had to leave a message in a voice mail. Guess what? No answer.I am French speaking. I was shocked to see that Bitdefender is asking French-speaking people to write their demand in English. Maybe Bitdefender is not aware of the number of people that speak French. And yes, all my messages were written in English."
Rowan,4,4,"Awesome antivirus, been using it for about 2 years now. Just had to contact support so I could add more devices (the links on the site didn't work for some reason) but they were super quick to respond (pretty much instant) and were able to help me out."
Dawid van Niekerk,1,1,"If you are software developer, Bitdefender is an extremely bad idea! A single compile in eclipse based IDE took me about 10 minutes. After getting frustrated with my PC I realized that it was in fact the antivirus! After deactivating Bitdefender protection I got 2 second compiles. I've contacted Bitdefender but they refuse to refund me beause more than 30 days elapsed after purchase. Bitdefender actually said that they would extend the licence by 6 months which would actually be a nice gesture if the software was actually usable. Will definately be moving to ESET!"
Danny,28,1,"I installed Bitdefender anti virus in November 2017, then in January 2018 my PC got slower & slower until I had to take for repair, the shop found it riddled with viruses including trogans. Bitdefender stopped none!I contacted Bitdefender,who requested several logs(etc) to be emailed to them, but after a week nothing.Total waste of money."
George Loudon,2,5,good protection with some good tools and fair price
ckn,32,3,got 12 months subscription only to show 30 days trial.Since then they have sorted the problemIt took time but was done
Balliesenior,7,5,"A very worthwhile system to have on your computer,with very efficient backup"
G T Marcus,1,5,Seems to work better than Mcaffee & Norton
Richard,49,4,"Product easy to install on PC and Android phone.  Dashboard seems easy enough to follow.  Hopefully the protection provided is good!I had one issue - the firewall was preventing me to connect to work servers - that I had to refer to Bitdefender support.  My query was resolved in a single exchange - the response wasn't quick, but the main point is that is was effective."
Michael Dominy,13,5,Excellent protection and value for money.
Abdul Rafay,1,3,JUST AVGRAGE PRODUCT. NOT GREAT INTERFACE AND LACK OF FEATURES THEN OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE MCAFEE. ITS DEVICE CONNECTION INFORMATION UPDATE VERY LATE.
Andre Weck,4,1,"Not better than any other protection software, plus it places itself in the utilities folder, instead of in applications, so when you're trying to uninstall it, you won't find it unless you go google it. Unacceptable."
Mr Jp Bell,5,5,Great protection with no hassle
Vignesh Manjeshwar,1,5,"A excellent product..  Using it since last 2 years...Have it on all my home systems (family pack) and all our cellular devices._  Had recommended same to our Office as well..In my recent experience, Thier customer care was immediate in helping me out.. was way more caring than my best expectation.."
Tony Cabral,1,1,"I may never know if the product is any good as after purchasing their 2018 version and paying for quick installation and downloading team viewer to do so, it became a total dead-end with nothing happening. Called customer support but no help as they cannot connect to their techs that do remote installations?"
Damian Alexandru,1,5,Good protection ! Excellent suport !
Codrut Sebastian Fagaras,1,4,"I am  not a technical person so my review must be considered as is. I am pleased by Bitdefender. It is easy to install, quite easy to set up though some features need further research in order to understand their importance or their functionality."
Colin Tipping,10,5,"Paid for wrong product - idiot me. When I realised, I contacted Bitdefender. Chatroom agent was about 10 minutes away (I had plenty of stuff to do whilst I waited) and immediately helpful. An email was promised which I expected would lead to a dialogue with me trying to persuade the company to undo my own mistake. WRONG!! The email was prompt and, to my surprise, the company had already corrected my error and with politeness and fast reaction. Worth bothering to fill in this opinion for others to read. If you are in the market for Bitdefender's products, go for it is my advice."
Capt. Z,2,5,"2017 & 2018 Bitdefender Total Security is the best overall security for any user!  If your wanting features that cover safe browsing, Malwares, Ransomware, to name a few, this will work very well.  However if you like extras that come in handy, the following list will show a few out of many other features that come with it.  Safepay-pay bills securely, VPN access, Computer-One Click Optimiser, File cleanup, Data/File Safes, and more.  These are just examples of what we use but a further look and you'll see benefits of having Bitdefender.  5 Stars for many great security services plus the many useful tools that the other guys either don't have or offer!  3000 plus attempted security breaches avoided with Bitdefender this year!  Computer stays healthy and update with Bitdefenders added features!DO NOT PURCHASE THROUGH AVANGATE!  They took money, the product would not work as advertised so I contacted them, they sent me to the manufacturer who sends me back to Avangate and the cycle continued until I decided to quit doing business with them a month later.  No concern for what happens after they get your money.  False advertising, horrible Customer Service, untrustworthy vendors are just a few examples of why I buy Bitdefender thru the BitdefenderCentral website.  I hope Bitdefender is not tied to Avangate, it will only ruin your reputation and is probably the reason for complaints.  I saw a few that sounded like the customer was brushed off leaving their computer in distress.  That's Avangate for you.  Received a reply from Avangate after they mention my Bitdefender renewal, trying to get me to pay to have them set it up, so I expressed my experience thoroughly.  They responded without apology or concern for my experience but rather tried selling me on other services, not to mention, they sent a link to all the positive reviews.  To us it really shows who they are and why you should not trust them.  CaptZbass"
Kevin C,1,1,gave me 100% ram usage. Couldn't even uninstall it from safe mode. Once I finally got it uninstalled my computer was healthy again.
Chris Fontenot,1,1,"I don't feel safe trusting this.  bitdefender internet security slowed down chrome to 1mbps.  I confirmed this by speedtest.net tests jumping back & forth from chrome, edge & firefox, only chrome had super slow speed.  This was FURTHER confirmed upon uninstalling it & testing chrome's speed once again.  Stay away, stay FAR away!"
Laurent,3,1,"I confirm the customer service below my expectation . You asks me to translate my comments given in french on the french TrustPilot site !! Unacceptable for a worldwide company like BDSo you are free to answer to me or not but it is not to a customer to help a provider but the opposite, so please asks to your French support for translationwww. bitdefender.fr /consumer/support/But we can see that even in a BD French web site the language is mix French / English : not very serious.Furthermore some answers are given here  (in English !!) to some French questions or comments so why not for mine ?"
Michael,4,1,"In over 10 years I have not worked with such a hostile piece of software.Several ""false positives"" are extremely annoying, but in the end I guess one could live with those in these dangerous times. However, no replies from customer service (if you can find a way to post your message that is), unintuitive settings, lack of program feedback (I do this..because...) and, basic respect for the user (i.e. Hey, I blocked this, but feel free to override, because it is YOUR computer, human) and the fact that completely turning all protection off still blocks (completely legitimate!) sites are UNACCEPTABLE. How this product got it's favorable reviews is is total mystery to me. I for one am going back to my previous AV-software and ask for a refund. BTW, I have used bitdefender for more than 6 weeks, so this is not a decision taken lightly."
Johannes,4,5,"Bitdefender Total Security has never failed me, and does not consume noticeable resources. Several very useful tools and features on top of the great antivirus. The real charm of it is that it runs in the background and handles everything. Don't mess with it, and you'll never have to worry about viruses - just make sure to manually perform a full scan occasionally.The customer support is also great. Never had a problem with them, and they are easily accessible via a chat (that actually works well).I've been using Bitdefender for 7 years now, and I see no rational reason to use any other antivirus service."
Wael Bakr,1,3,
David Hoare,4,5,Not the easiest product to install if you have installed the Free version to begin with - don't !
Tee Salo,5,4,"Customer service and problem solving via Chat works fine and fast and is on par with the product. My four star is the most I can give, because there is never ending potential for improvement in most everything."
Jim Hahn,1,5,Switched to Bitdefender from Kaspersky and have been very pleased with the results!
Joaniy Hand,1,1,"I had Bitdefender installed - unasked - on my computer by a repair shop, when I took it in after it seized completely. I will be taking the computer back to the shop to get them to rid me forever of Bitdefender, as it is the most intrusive - to the point of harrassment - advertiser I have experienced. The Bitdefender screen pops up every 10 minutes (literally, I have timed it) and covers whatever screen I am trying to use, begging me to open an account, simply because a ""free trial"" was installed. Yesterday I received an email from them, and to my great annoyance was unable to respond, because it came from a ""Do Not Reply"" address. GRRRR. Just GO AWAY please."
Chris,16,5,"Their Customer Support Team (Emma), was really helpful, informative, collaborate and helped me sort out of my problem. Without being judgemental or putting up barriers 5 stars. Thank you"
Robert Ionas,2,5,
Nick Hughes,8,1,"After an auto update the Anti virus stoped working, did the usual removed it downloaded latest version etc. Still no joy, decided to remove completely as I could not even use the MS defender in windows 10. During the removal stage asked why I was doing so, gave answer, then got email from customer support, asking me not to do that but send them an error log. This I did but after 4 attempts they  said they could not open it and so we used a data transfer site, this as far as I know worked but nothing from them since even though I asked,now they tell me they only support paid for products, so shy waste my time? The original contact was January 5th now February  16th. Or  am l just being used to help the R&D.😟😟 Ticket number 2018011112100001 getting to know this number ,as I have to keep quoting it. Solved nearly a 2months later, now a happy man , but leaving single star as reminder that you failed to give the service expected."
Leah B,1,1,"Doesn't update. Contacted support 2 weeks ago for help, told me to re-install and gave me some applications to help me with the process, did as told still didn't work. I was told my problem will be moved higher in the chain, been over a week since i've had a response.Not acceptable, bought a years license, can't even use the product."
Don Whitehead,1,5,"As obvious by the reviews, you either like Bitdefender or not. I for one: Like their product and service they provide through their support team. I used (Norton Internet Security Symantec) for years and ran into some issues with (The Safe you create with your own passwords etc...) not wanting to open for password protection on their secure web site etc... Bitdefender has never generated a problem, that a polite and knowledgable tech of theirs was not able to resolve. Yeah they may be busy at times, and you may have to wait a little while for your turn, but if you are patient, like a civilized human being should be, I promise you they will resolve the issue promptly: As many replys from them on here to obvious ones that had issues so indicates and verifies. I have confidence they understand (WE THE CUSTOMER) make them, or break them and they understand making it right and fair with the customer is their present and future success! GUARANTEED!!! I've used internet security (mainly Norton) for over 40 years. So this is definetely nothing new to me. Having said that: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BITDEFENDER in (All categories of service provided across the board) and  40 Years of experience makes that statement. Have a great day. God Bless"
Steffen Weng,3,5,Couldn't find my subscription license key. Got quick help from their support (within 24h). Have been using BD since 2008. Consistently good reviews on multiple sites. Fair price.
Tom Reed,1,1,"I was sold by the ratings. I had Bullguard which wasn't set to expire until July. I got a couple trojan viruses looking at a couple porn sites. Bullguard missed a few. Any way, I downloaded the 30 day free trial. What a nightmare. My first clue is when I was knocked off the Internet with my desktop ( direct ethernet) and lap top, wireless. I reset the router but still couldn't get the wireless to work. This Bitdefender turned off the wireless on the router. I finally was able to get both computers running normally , but only after wasting an hour. Later, I was upstairs and turned on my phone. The wireless showed ' unconnected.' After about 10 times using the correct password I still couldn't sign on. I went downstairs  and turned on the desktop....same crap. No wireless as well. I looked at two warning flags indicating Windows firewall was off and so was the Bitdefender firewall. An error message indicated something to the effect Bitdefender had access to security and was controlling the firewalls. I couldn't manually turn them on. That was it. I uninstalled this nightmare antivirus software. I think it sucks."
SizaRss,1,5,Great program and perfect customer service. I would highly recommend Bitdefender
Randall,3,5,"As far as I know, nothing has got past this software! It is an all-in-one too, plus I have 2 PC's and 2 tablets and my phone that can all be protected. I love it!"
Peter M,9,4,"Very comprehensive,  Appears to do an outstanding job.  Needs some technical knowledge in order to obtain the best results but maybe all the really good solutions do.Excellent support service that always respond fairly quickly"
Brenda Gaines,1,5,"Hi Guys,I have had a great experience with Bitdefender. Their Customer Service and Representatives are very professional and swiftly to fix any problem that you made have.  They are there for their customers 24/7 plus I did get three months trials with this Company and when I joined they gave me another extra month.  They are a lovely Company and very friendly, outstanding in their technology and they know what they are doing. I will recommend that you try this Company because they will be there for you each time and really you will fall in love with Bitdefender!"
Luzelle Hutchison,1,5,Had a problem and they help me get it fixed
Mehdi Madh Khaan,1,5,"I really can't think of any threat that BitDefender has ever failed to cover. Plus, its customer support would never leave you wondering about how to solve your problems and it is surprisingly fast/quick. Two thumbs up for BitDefender!"
Carol,12,1,"I loathe this product & will never use it again.  Today I received an error message that stated both my Bitdefender firewall & virus protection was disabled.  I followed the directions to turn it back on THREE times, yet it refused to enable.  I went to their site & searched until my eyes hurt for a solution.  None.  I found their phone numbers & called but received a message that they weren't taking calls on one & the other didn't ring or anything.  I tried to online chat but received a message that no agents were available.  Their site says I'm protected but my computer says I'm not.  I'm canceling & going elsewhere.  This is ridiculous.  Have they closed up shop?"
Mohammad Ali Khandan,3,5,"Bitdefender is strongest sofrware against any knid of threats which protect the users with high rate protective options to combats viruses and malware(ransomware,keylogger,etc). I used so many of the antiviruse softwares and found the bitdefender strongest and progressive."
Mr Melvyn Jeremiah,5,5,"After years of dissatisfaction with McAfee and Norton I have been trying out various alternatives. My experience is interesting, because it does not always bear out the various online assessments. However, the Which? Assessment of Bitdefender as the best antivirus and anti malware suite around mirrors my own assessment. I am running a trial version, and if nothing untoward happens in the meantime I shall certainly sign up at the end the month."
Trading Amoret,1,1,"Customer Service is appalling, takes too long to get any sort of response, if any. last time I had the same problem, I am now done. 2 chances gone."
Errol Mapham,3,5,BitDefender is a good product with the beast support services I have experienced on any IT product. I have twice contacted support and have received immediate and professional support which resolved my problem.
mike r,1,1,"had it for a while, not technically qualified to comment on its performance followed the good reviews.initially had an issue with safe pay - drove me mad - had to rinstall with patch then following another glitch had to reinstall again - but it fails only gets to 93% which seems common.Support was hopeless - included links that didnt work exist, phoned several times, deleted reloaded several times  using differing suggestions all with the same result - promised it would be given urgent priority - that was last week - nothing so far other than ano promise it would be given urgent attention!! Meanwhile it says my PC is not protected, browsers say things are unsafe etc all you get is promises no action.i have asked for refund again reponse is they will look into it - past performance indicates otherwisestill waitingafter several more days!!! so urgent seems to have a different meaning for bitdefender - opened yet ano ticket tto tryu and get response/action ref  2018020816210004"
Neil,9,3,"I'm sure the antivirus works well as verified by many lab reports; my concerns are with their business practices and with the poor control panel on their product.  I purchased their product just last month, and in my experience they are not upfront about : you have actually purchased a subscription, not a one-off.  They had set up a direct debit which was not explicit from the purchase product page.  Furthermore, it is not the complete product I expected - when I go into the control panel, various parts of the security system are marked as 'upgrade to get these'.  My experience of using it - its just annoying, kicking in to reduce my screen brightness at 29% battery so far that I struggled to see the screen to get back to settings and raise it again (I'm partially sighted and need it bright).  I have my own brightness levels set - I don't want my antivirus to control my screen brightness thank you!  I'm actually going to uninstall and renew with my previous product I had for many years.  I don't like how Bitdefender behave.--- edit below---Hi, thanks for the response. Order #67057935Antivirus Plus - I was under the impression I was purchasing a security product rather than just antivirus - that could be my mistake.My order history shows that I had unticked auto-renew before purchase, yet when I went into my paypal account there was an automatic subscription set up.  That is very questionable.Thanks for the offer of help but I just want a refund. I am uninstalling and going back to the previous product I had used for many years.--- further update ---Thank you for your prompt action, refund received."
Gus,9,3,Paid for the product - got a receipt but did NOT receive a download link - sent them a polite message asking for one - just received a reply offering to help and I consider them to have resolved the issue satisfactorily.
Allan Clarke,1,4,"Great product, my only gripe being that communication seems to need improving."
J London,29,5,ExcellentEasy to use for Mac no problems defending well used for over 5years
Mary Wise,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender Anti Virus Plus for some years now and am totally satisfied with its performance,  ease of installation and use"
Ahmed Wael,1,5,i suggest getting bitdefender it is the definition of performance and security but the Only Disadvantage this great product has is Its cost it is really high on you shopping list but it deserves every penny so if you already staked on money and something that gives you security i suggest going with bitdefender and specifically the total security one because why not .
Graham,5,1,Seemed to work fine on the trail but have had issues since with installing on multiple machines. Support is non-existent. Three days after raising the ticket I got an email saying they were looking at it and a week later still nothing. The traffic light web browser plugin does slow web browsing noticeably.Your assigned ticket number is 2018012808110004.
Gale Alhart,1,2,Had them for maybe 5 years. Every time I needed to contact them for something have customer service overseas never could communicate with them always mixing up my messages offer discount if you renew early then 2 weeks later zap my card for payment again never did get them to understand what they did but I did get reimbursed but gave up went to someone else
Zahid Hasan,1,5,"If anyone want full proof Protection with zero down of computer performance, then definitely go with Bitdefender... Its really a amazing product.... Most important thing is their customer services... They give solution quickly and effectively whatever how much big the problem is.... I recommend only Bitdefender to others because i have experienced with it..."

Adebayo Fale,2,4,"Dear Sirs,I wanted the internet security suite but the tech who helped me just helped with this antivirus for the Mac.  Anyway I hope I am not charged for the internet security suite. Besides that the technician was a very nice guy and helped me configure my system adequately. He was  Matt.  Anyway so far I am pleased but going to avant gate website Yours Truly,Adebayo Fale"
robert mclachlan,1,5,I could not have received better & more courteous attention.
Howard,2,4,Customer Service was fast And Efficient. True solutions to my 'problem' at hand. (Getting my subscription to involve Mac protection).Text chat with effective solution all round.Thanks
Mohammad Ali,1,5,One of the best security I have ever experience that comes up with almost everything you did to secure you PC as well in performance.
Cody k,2,5,"Bitdefender is top-rated or top-three in every legitimate (non-sponsored) ranking of antiviruses. It is VERY lightweight, and works almost 100% transparently on even underpowered laptops, but also has tremendous flexibility to control features, or to let it run on autopilot."
Андрей Соловьёв,1,5,"The program is convenient, reliable and at the same time easy to configure. I recommend!"
Michael,2,5,This is the first time as Bitdefender user (Antivirus 2018) and these comments are after one week's experience. Five stars because:1. Easy to purchase online and easy to download.2. Simple to install on more than one device.3. Good price compared to others.4. Excellent support for the one issue I encountered and promptly resolved.5. Simple easy to use interface.6. Works seamlessly and without hampering system performance.
Sergei Shushunov,2,1,No customer support. It took 10 days to obtain a download link after paying for the product. It quit working a week after being downloaded.
Matt Novak,2,1,"Terrible customer support. Logged a problem, got two emails within few days saying ""we will contact you as soon as possible"" and that's it. Nothing more."
Adam Sky,3,5,Excellent product and very professional and helpful customer care.

Willem de Ronde,1,5,Bitdefender's service is excellent and their software is the no 1 security software in the world.
David V,1,3,"I tried installing Bitdefender twice yesterday. After downloading it, the price was $20 more, so I found another online site advertising $39.95 and paid with Paypal. After downloading, removing previous Bitdefender, and installing this, I can not receive Windows mail. They do not supply a contact phone number, I have filled out 3 support requests, but no phone call, and can not receive email to communicate. Do not bother with a company you can't talk to on a telephone!Update Dec 28, 2017--Just found out the antivirus was calling all inbound email spam and blocking it.  Am figuring out how to customize the application which is intuitive.  The Bitdefender antispam toolbar does not support Vista 64 bit OS which explains why I couldn't modify the spamguard. After turning it off, I found that they did respond to support requests, and am working towards resolution of issues. Also, I finally found the phone # on a link on the support website as in their reply."
Diablo Gaming,1,2,"The software looks legit. Won the award. All good.Here comes what is horrible about BitDefender.1) They send tremendous amount of spam mails when it comes to renewal. Even if you purchased/renewed the product. It is super annoying to see them. And they always say 'please ignore this mail if you already renewed'. You can if it is once or twice. For a company like this, you would expect them to have a system such that they can track if the person holds the product from their company.2) Their customer service is bad. They don't listen to your problems fully and try to give solutions which are irrelevant. Learn to listen. I asked about this spam mails and they gave me the answer 'to make sure our computer is safely protected.' I am not that stupid. And this clearly tells that a software that is supposed to stop spam mails actually sends spam mails. Before that the person I talked to thought I was talking about auto renewal. May need English capability check for workers.3) Renewal/Purchase price is insane for the regular members. Make sure you turn off the auto renewal off. You would expect to have better deals for regular or loyal customers, but no. Make sure to search online to look for better deals from different sales. They normally beat the sale - according to BitDefender - they provide to regular customers. Moreover auto-renewal is way more expensive. And it is hard to turn this option off. Great right?4) They lie to you about Subscription expiration. Emails say it expires today or it already expired, but software says otherwise. Has more than 10 days and got expiration e-mail. Moreover, when you go to Bitdefender central, they do not mention the exact remaining date of your subscription, but put expires soon. I find this amazingly dodgy and irritation. We paid for a product and have the right to know when the product expires."
Ari,4,1,"I bought Internet Security 2018 frm BitDefender online having received an e-mail telling me the price would be AUD$24.98. By the time I had bought the product, the price ended up being USD$50.00 or arould AUD$60Nevertheless, the product wouldn´t install and support couldn´t help so I asked for my money back.At the same time, I filed a dispute on Paypal to ensure I would indeed get my money back.Within minutes from doing that, I had an e-mail from a Bogdan Giagu of Bitdefender telling me that as I had filed the dispute, they would do nothing for me and the dispute could be dragged out up to 120 daysAt the same time, the subscription I had paid for has been cancelled so I have no product (faulty or working) and a limited chance of ever seeing my USD$50 backIn good faith and after having liaised with a support person, (Vlad Florescu ), I cancelled my dispute on Paypal hoping to get attention for my refund.What a mistake! Quick as they were telling me that once I filed a dispute they would do nothing for me, now there is no responce.All I can suggest to others - don´t spend your money on BitDefender - this is the way you can expect to be treated.Buy elsewhere! AntiVirus products are at a dime and in fact, there are quite a few free ones that are just as good and you don´t get ripped off!BitDefender is a Romanian Company where they have no legal responsibilities to their clients like in Western Countries. Be aware!29/12: This is an update to my dealings with BitDefender - a Company that makes money out of purportedly making Internet Commerce more secure. They have finally conceded that they should refund the faulty product however for some mysterious reasons, it just isn´t happening.I got some message claiming the ""refund has been requested"" and the money ""should be in my account on 5 - 7 days""??These people know as well as I do that I purchased via Paypal and Paypal refunds are instant and done with a single click of the mouse.I realise I divulged the name of the support person who told me they could drag the refund out to 120 days if I persisted with a Paypal dispute but for a large Company preying on an individual over $50 refund is pathetic.I don´t think I have any words harsh enough to describe their performance so all I can say to people considering buying from them, don´t just believe my story. Read through several articles of feedback and you will see the pattern of poor support and an absolute reluctance to do the right thing when their product doesn´t work."
Mark,2,5,Super easy to install.  Works EXTREMELY well. Phenomenal Customer Service.Hard to believe there is a vendor out there THIS GREAT!!!Mark
Chris Baldwin,29,1,I just found out my product has been auto renewed. I never requested auto-renewal. There is no place in my account where I can unsubscribe from auto-renewal. I never received any email saying it would auto renew. I never renew as it is half the price buying as a new customer. THIS IS A DISGRACEFUL WAY OF DOING BUSINESS.
Waterdragon 62,1,1,"For the past few days, I have been trying to get Bitdefender to stop an autorenewal that I had no idea had been set up in my account at a higher price - $149.95 for a year for a 2015 family pack !!! I did my last year's renewal manually which was $97.47 and had no idea an autorenewal had been set up. I tried to access my account on several occasions to cancel the auto renewal after I became aware of it, but no luck - it is such a complex process to cancel, even if you knew it existed. After several days my request to the support team to not proceed with the renewal has not been answered (my ticket number is1646215) and there is no number to call from Australia to talk to anyone. This has been a very bad experience for me, I hope Bitdefender show some Christmas spirit and refund my renewal fee, as this is a rip-off. **** Thank you Bitdefender for your reply below - my order number is 66382310 - could you please process my refund asap as I have also incurred a $4.50 banking fee as you have processed your payment. PS - the Advangate support centre associated with your company still has not replied***Hopefully - I will get a refund as promised soon it has been five days now and still no reply."
Bill,2,5,"Enjoyed the free version for a number of years, upgraded to Total Security 2018, about 1 week ago, so far no issues. Main reason for upgrade is a single system protection on a number of devices.If continuing experience anything like free version with extra functionality then can only recommend."
Steve3513,4,2,"They have a great product but their support, either by phone or email is so seriously lacking that I am considering moving to another product.This is the third year in a row that I have had renewal problems with my business related product, and while a good product, is not even close to being worth the headache.They would be a stellar outfit if they took customer service seriously"
Fiona Davies,1,5,
Sabrina P,3,5,Great antivirus protection that doesn't slow down the system. Customer service is awesome to!
Jenny,3,5,"I am extremely pleased that I purchased my virus protection from Bitdefender.  I had some initial problems with the software - after a few problem solving attempts - Bitdefender  simply upgraded me to a higher protection model at no extra cost and extended my years subscription by 6 months for free. I have had no problems since. There are 3 important services provided by  Bitdefender Security that will have me renewing the program when it expires - 1) problems are addressed immediately and resolved quickly 2) the 'safepay"" feature is included at no extra price - 3) It's a complete system  and no extra payments are ever required."
Mr Mark Ellis,19,5,"I have used Bitdefender for four years and never had a security issue.  Mostly I don't even notice working until I hit a bad web site when it makes the risks of visiting clear.  When there is a conflict of Bitdefender and other vendors software ( and all software dose at some time or other not just Bitdefender) their online agents are easy to get hold of and provide a fix very quickly.  I have in the past used other AV software but none have been as effective and well supported to the extent that Bitdefender protects my Parents PC and they don't even know its there and no longer have to spend time sorting out AV problems and get more family time. A winner all round.ONLY let down by their aggressive marketing policies, sales campaigns and in app sales !"
John,1,1,"I have been asking their customer support by email to refund the auto-renewal charges because I already renewed 3 months prior the expiration of my subscription. At first, they asked me to create a ticket on their website. I created the ticket but still, no action taken. I have been sending emails daily in the past two weeks but no response at all."
Julio,8,5,"Such an amazing product, powerful and simple to use. Great support also, a couple of times I needed help and I received it in one day"
leah,2,1,"We've been happy with the product until we realised they'd auto renewed without warning and taken £70 out of our account. We've been unable to contact anyone about this issue which just adds salt to the wound. Really crappy customer service makes us wish we'd not gone with this company, to begin with."
Bill Henn,1,3,"This regarding the new BitDefender box. The antivirus/malware is a great product, I've tested quite a few over the years, this program is one of the best. That being said, I bought the box v.1 last year, now they come out with a v.2 which is expected, however instead of existing customer being able to upgrade the software on their box, you have to buy a new one at 2 1/2 time the price of the original. If this is the trend of this company is going, out for just profits then I will have to move my family to a different product."
Pratheek Hegde,1,4,Bitdefender is best & it's really excellent. I have used it. The only thing where people ( including me) will get a little hesitation is the price. Don't get me wrong but the price for a middle class family is very important & it's a little expensive you can say. Otherwise it's the best antivirus you can get in the market. Fully satisfied.
Magnus Rønne Kviesgaard,9,1,"Fin overskuelig software, MEN det blokerer netwærksdrev. Og det virker ikke til at der er simple måder at forhindre dette udover at lade være med at bruge deres firewall, hvilket netop er hvad jeg har betalt for.Et lille citat fra deres egen hjemmeside:NOTE: If you still cannot connect to the device, you may want to look for other firewall solutions. If the issue persists, you can open an email ticket and we will answer the question or concern in the shortest time possible.(kan findes ved at søge på ""bitdefender blocking network share"" (trustpilot tillader ikke links))"
YouTube Administrator,1,1,"Ticket number is 2017120205430002.Order ID 65912456MY Subscription had been renewed automatically which I did not asked for or needed. However I contacted customer support team and no one has got back to me for the past week. I have contacted them numerous times during this period for which the answer was ""We will get back to you soon"". I will never be with Bitdefender ever again due to the bad customer service I have experienced. They should probably learn from ESET or Norton what customer service is like. I have already contacted my Bank about a Chargeback which is underway. Bitdefender as a product is good however the product is not complete with their useless customer support services. Shame!ThanksShan"
Odessa Fohn,1,1,"Late last year I renewed my subscription for another year of Bitdefender Total Security (for the upcoming 2017).  I took advantage of the 'early bird special' and purchased it for a discounted rate; $34.99 I think it was.  Well, in December, my original renew date, Auto-Renew kicked in and renewed me AGAIN for the regular cost of $89.99.  By renewing on my own early, that should have nullified the Auto-Renew setting, right?  BTW, I never ok'd Auto-Renew in the first place.I emailed ""Customer Service"".  They got back to me apologizing for my dissatisfaction, but never attempted to correct the error.  I contacted my bank, who gladly fixed it, by refunding the 89.99 back into my account.  In April of 2017, 4 months into my 12 month subscription (which I paid for -> 34.99 early bird special), they cancelled my subscription.  The 89.99 had been refunded back to me, but they still had the 34.99.  I paid for 12 months of coverage and they STOLE back the remaining 8 months worth.Please do not bother with these thieving thieves.        Why am I just now writing up a complaint in December 2017 (when they cancelled on me in April)?  I received an email just a few days ago, stating that my subscription was almost up, and they were going to Auto-Renew me for 2018!  My understanding is that when they cancelled on me in April, I was no longer a customer.  And that email reminded me how much I hate these thieves.  So I came here to vent.Did I mention that they're THIEVES."
Sabih Tasoz,11,5,"I  would not use another product always feel safer withbit defender, not to mention excellent support"
Catdrchris,1,3,"EDITED: This review, rating, and title were edited after Bitdefender eventually resolved my issue. Namely, refunding a 1 year auto-renew after I had purchased a 3 year subscription on CyberMonday.I am still not happy it took contacting Bitdefender via chat, email, 2 phone calls, and finally this review site to see a simple matter taken care of. The product is a 5/5, the support was a 2/5. No one was rude.I would advise anyone buying Bitdefender to use a one-off or temporary credit card number so you don't get auto-renewed against your wishes.Before my auto-renew deadline, I tried to find a way to opt-out of auto-renew through Bitdefender Central: there is none. After I couldn't stop auto-renew, in a chat with Bitdefender support, they said I had to opt-out via contacting customer support ahead of the auto-renew.I submitted my issue via email. When that went unanswered, I started a chat window, which resulted it my refund request being ""elevated"".  Days went by. I called, and again my problem was ""elevated"". The first actual email response tried to UPSELL me a bundle instead of issuing a refund on overlapping subscriptions.I was angry in my response to that ""double-elevated"" ticket, threatened to reverse the credit card charge, and found this review site. After posting here, my issue was resolved. It should not have taken all these steps.Best case, Bitdefender was swamped because of CyberMonday (though the chat and phone calls were on hold very short times), or worst case, they stalled and tried to upsell me, in a hope I would get frustrated and just let auto-renew slide.The overlapping subscription was refunded, my 3-year code worked, all my products were still activated as of this writing."
Christopher Griffin,1,3,"Thank you for the explanation but I still think it will be much easier to have that setting on the dashboard on the computer to select the auto renew there. And to make it even more user friendly to have a notice pop-up on the computer or whichever device to indicate that it is either on or off 30 days before your license expires. Thank you for the refund, but as a consumer it’s not great to get a deduction for something you actually had to unselect at the beginning of a purchase. That makes no sense. FYI your e-mails with the links to de-activate went to my junk mail. Thus it might not be such an effective method to notify your clients of this...**************************I have had the same issue regarding this matter and am absolutely appalled by the bold manner in which they will give you a good discount deal and no where state that an auto renewal is active. Even worse is that there is no place on my bitdefender account where they indicate that you have auto renew on nor a place where you can cancel it.This in my book is theft, one year special and next year wham 500% more than what you paid for the initial purchase. How can you still do business and get away with this, not even to speak about the ethical matter nor the social responsibility, do you even know what these concepts mean...? Stay as far away as possible from this product don't fall for this scam.Lets see if you will do the right thing and give me back my money. For your reference the order ID which I did not approve 65771688. I want my money back you thieves!!!!!!"
Abjads,2,1,"Those people are a ""bunch of hungry thieves"". They cancelled my subscription and ""stole"" my money. Their customer service is the worst I have ever seen. Their software is useless."

Scott Thomas,1,1,"I was very happy with 2016 total defender then they advised me to upgrade to 2017.  It was really more like I was forced to.  I had a three year plan with almost two years left.  After the upgrade I seem to have basic and not total security but that's not the bad news.  The 2017 ran a check on my c drive for programs or files not being used.  It deleted all files and almost all programs including every document, video and picture ever saved.  I had to go back three restore dates to save Windows 10.  The few programs saved often no longer work correctly.  I was a fan before this upgrade but will never buy bitdefender again.  All customer service could say was sorry. To Bitdefender response my ticket # is 2017101416400005Ok Bitdefender it been almost a week and I have not received an email and yes I've checked every Gmail folder. Yes I selected to clean the C drive of unused, unnecessary and seldom used files which is what your program stated in similar words.  Your program wiped almost my entire c drive.  I ran this before on 2016 Bitdefender without issue or additional input .  I have also ran this using many other programs over 30 years with only occasional minor issues.  As far as restore points, I tried everyone saved and only the oldest one worked to restore Windows 10 to it's most basic version and only 2-3 programs which now don't function properly.  Oddly enough that point was before I loaded Bitdefender shortly after buying my PC.  Every single picture, video, and document was permanently lost - literally 1000's that were irreplaceable.  I also lost countless programs the where used daily and weekly.  I would have preferred the worst virus out there - it might have been possible to recover from.  I am not a programmer and you have a flaw in 2017 to have made wiping my drive completely so easy despite what your program states when you first click on clean drive.  I have over a year left I've paid for plus a separate plan I paid for my phone.  I'm worried about your latest versions doing more unexpected permanent damage.  I also extremely concerned about your lack of support."
Azhar Mohd Yusoff,1,5,"The first year using Bitdefender, I'm liking it. I'm a gamer and it seems to hardly impact my laptop performance. It also has autopilot and exclusions. Some programs that I use are old, coming from Windows 7 and I can exclude the .exe file. When I upgraded to Windows 10, I don't have to buy a Windows 10 version. This is fair, since some apps asked to 'upgrade' and buy it's newer version. Also, Bitdefender works it's protection from the background, unobstrusively, which I didn't realised at first until I clicked the Systray icon and discovered the malicious sites it has blocked for me. I have an eight year old who shares my laptop, so thanks for protecting her too. My honest opinion."
Jeff Parkin,2,1,"Awful company took after I paid them they  took another £70.00 pounds from my account and it took me 15 emails and 5 phone calls to try to get the money back I still haven’t received the money. I’m going to contact BBC, The Times and consumer watchdog. And no apology!!!!!They did the same thing to me last year and said it was an accident……"
Harjinder,1,1,"Worst ever protection I have ever used, I bought it after reading very good reviews on internet but am very much disappointed as I started using it. Menu is not user friendly but very complicated, parental control is a gimmick, I set up controls for my son but it is controlling my login, there is no way to contact customers services, chat line are continuously busy and it is next to impossible to contact them, websites don't open in safepay and many other problems, please don't waste your hard earned money on this rubbish software. I need refund as I cant carry on with this for 1 year. My ticket no. is 2017112721060007 and the web chat was horrible, the agent on other side had no idea about the problems I told him."
Dan Bolton,5,5,I've been using BitDefender for a little while now and it is remarkable. It quite honestly is like having your own personal PC technician constantly looking at ways to improve your system and keep it safe against threats. The worry of handling situations yourself is utterly removed and you rest easy with complete peace of mind.I HIGHLY recommend BitDefender.
turbulence,5,5,"Great product, even better customer care, 1000 times better than AVG, who take your money, quick enough, then, don’t care."
Alan Smith,5,5,My personal research indicated this was one of the most effective security programme on the market and since I have installed and used it it has constantly protected my laptops and warned me of many perils that cyberspace can throw at you.
Slo Vols,2,5,"I have used BitDefender for many years on all my PC's.  Renewal time is coming up, so I tried to pay my upcoming subscription, BUT B/D can NOT send me a working link to make payment through.  They have blamed my PC, told me to use a different browser, that EDGE might be causing the problem (I do NOT have EDGE as a browser), and other things.  I never had this problem in the past.  Even a new email they sent me for purchasing their products does NOT have working links!  Once I get past this ""GLITCH"" they have with the renewal link, I'll be back to my happy self!UPDATE:  12-08-2017  After the unbelievable run-a-round by the billing department at BitDefender, I went to AMAZON and made my purchase for about the same price, got my activation key & extended my subscription in less than ten minutes!  Over a half dozen emails with the BitDefender billing department, and over an hour of wasted time & they still do NOT get that they have an internal problem.UPDATE:  12-11-2017   BitDefender Chat Ticket #2017110517250005Now let's see if BitDefender can make me 'satisfied customer' once again!"
James D,2,2,"Hi, I have Bitdefender for some years now but recently have noticed that it is writing a vast amount of data to my SSD Boot drive. (MacOS High Sierra 10.13.1).  When I say vast I mean like the two daemons it runs have now written more than 57Gb to that drive.  I have sent screen-grabs of Activity Monitor showing this but have had absolutely no response to repeated questions as what it is writing.  (Some screen grabs arrived very damaged by Apple Mail so I have since re-sent more.) The extremely slow response and failure to say what BD is writing have me very concerned.  The drive concerned only has about 150Gb on it so it can hardly be a list of files and dates of changes that it's writing.  For what they charge the lack if response is pitiful and shameful.If anyone from BD is reading this the emails are RE: New Ticket from Chat 2017051115070001.  If I can't get satisfaction to this issue I will definitely get rid of it and recommend to all my clients that they do so as well.UPDATE:  BD did respond and told me that their scanning function expands all archives such as .ZIP and .RAR files so it can scan them.  This is what causes the massive amount of disk writing.  I still don't like that given that SSD drives have a finite amount of read/write cycles so I have asked them to see if there's another way to achieve the scans.  I will report back here on whether or not they achieve that.  I'm increasing my rating to two stars since they did respond."
Stephen S.,6,5,"I did a lot of research on Windows anti-virus solutions. The one product that consistently ranked highly, sometimes at the top, was Bitdefender. So, I purchased Bitdefender and could not be happier with my decision. The product itself is great and has many of the same features as its competitors and a lot more. But the value or price for what you get is what particularly stands out. Lastly, Bitdefender's support is awesome! I had a question on Thanksgiving day and to my surprise a chat agent was available to help me. Overall, Bitdefender is a fantastic product - if you do your homework, I'm sure you'll agree."
Linda Maginity,1,5,"I just renewed during the ""Black Friday"" sale.

Rebecca McGill,6,5,I switched to Bitdefender virus protection service for my computer to due multiple errors with another company. So far it has worked well with my computer and I am quite happy with it.
Rodney Morse,1,5,Bitdefender Stands For Great Quality Security Software & There Company Is Trusted Security Too & Well Known In Business & Consumer Users & Geeks World Wide & Used By Millions All Over The World
Ervin Hoxha,2,5,Liked the interface. Is easy to use. When installed on infected PC very effective removal. Really nice feature is the password wallet which is perfectly integrated with Firefox and Chrome (browsers I use). The mobile version was a surprise. Very easy to use.
Abner Almeida,3,1,Product is ok but support is horrible and useless! Product is ok but support is horrible! I have a issue which is preventing my anti-virus signature to get updated ... I raised the case 3 weeks ago ... and so far I haven't received any communication (apart from asking for a screen shot).After 1 month without getting anti-virus updates on any of my 6 computers nor any response from support (tried getting in touch with their live chat ... total waste of time) ... I decided to uninstall BitDefender and get a FREE anti-virus. That is how bad it is.The main reason why I paid for anti-virus (instead of to use one of the many excellent free options) is support ... but Bitdefender's support is not even close to be good enough. Shame. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
David MacEwen,1,1,I've used Bitdefender for about three years.  I recently last October and hve had NOTHING but trouble.  I've installed it but i don't get a weekly report as I used to and seriously doubt it's running.  Their customer service people are almost impossible to get a hold of and their accent are so heavy it's difficult to understand them at all.  When i contact them by e mail they take over a week to get a response.  One guy walked me through doing a log of my system and sending it to him.  He said he received it. The next day they sent me an e mail saying I sent the wrong thing.  I'd like my money back so I can buy some other protection.  I used to swear by them now they are just awful.
Stephen Ryan,7,5,Protection with trust and 24x7 support is good.  It is ranked as top 10 anti viruses in the market with highest rating.
Bev Payne,22,5,Bitdefender is very good but the Customer Services and Online Chat is even better... they are available to chat 24/7 and the support is excellent
Geert Margodt,3,5,"It's the most complete solution ever. Although I'm careful while working online, it gives me a safe feeling Bitdefender is doing its fantastic job on the background.  There's no better AV for me !"
James,29,2,"Bitdefender is a well-reviewed anti-virus application. After several years as its customer, I can agree that it protects my Mac successfully—when it works. But within the last few months, when I booted up my Mac, Bitdefender's window which ordinarily reports that ""Your Mac Is Safe,"" sometimes told me that ""Your Mac Is Unprotected"" or that ""Your Protection Has Expired"" even though my subscription still has many weeks to go! There are days when Bitdefender, without any input from me, normalizes. But as I have repeatedly told Bitdefender via its chat, email, and phone support, if Bitdefender protection is not continuous, it is of questionable value. In all these weeks, however, Bitdefender has not been able to provide me with an apt diagnosis of the problem or a fix. Bitdefender has failed to live up to its advertised promise that ""Everything gets solved, guaranteed."" Be warned as well that although Bitdefender's first suggestion is to use its uninstaller to remove the app and then reinstall, there was no uninstaller included in the original download package on my compuer! My many requests to Bitdefender to provide me with an uninstaller went unanswered by the company. Since the Bitdefender app includes a self-protection gimmick, one cannot quit let alone remove the application . . . without going to the terminal of the Mac. Luckily, I found a youtube vid that led me through this removal process, so at last I have rid my Mac of Bitdefender . . . even though my paid subscription has yet to expire. Now, I can install a different anti-virus package. One other matter that has always bothered me about Bitdefender: One does not purchase the app directly from the app designer but from its marketing partner Avangate. This separation makes the renewal process in particular extraordinarily labyrinthine. Subscribers will receive competing invitations to renew at a bizarre array of different prices over the course of a subscription. During my time as a customer, I thought I was renewing and wound up buying a concurrent subscription. I am glad to be free of these complications now. I am glad to be free of Bitdefender."
Dee Bowen,8,5,Really helpful and great protection for my imac
Sri Savoor,24,5,"Having used several anti virus packages over the years and finding most of them eventually either started slowing the machine or didn't pickup on a virus or malware, I finally opted for Bit Defender. I want something that runs in the background that I can just leave alone for it to do its thing. I'm 100% satisfied that the software is working very well, my Macbook Pro Late 2010 has not experienced any issues since I installed Bit Defender. No slowing down, no viruses or Malware. I purchased a 3 year license for total piece of mind. Would definitely recommend this to anyone using a Mac. The software was recommended to me by an International Network Peripheral manufacturer, if its good enough for them, its definitely good for the end user."
Dee taneja,1,5,Have not had any problems or threats on my Mac so far. Today's computing needs protection. Completely satisfied with Bitdefender.
Customer,7,5,"Excellent product, no perceivable impact on performance. Even caught a couple of windows based viruses in spam emails received on my Mac. Not as yet come across any Mac based viruses, but I class myself as a cautious person, that said I know it only takes one mistake to cause a mess of trouble so Bitdefender was my choice of antivirus to watch my back.I know Macs are less prone to viruses, but ""less"" isn't ""not"", so like all insurance policies, you hope to never need it but it feels better knowing it's there."
Phillip Steptoe,10,5,
Liz Hayes,3,3,"Bad Customer Support Skills..... I have liked the security, but the support is hopeless. I have wasted a couple of hours this morning - with nobody able to finalise what should be pretty simple. I am now on hold to phone support, with no idea what number I am in the queue.  I think a Refund Request is the next step?  :("

Marcello Ebelini,1,5,So far Bitdefender has made me feel more comfortable with this protection.Lost confidence it some of the other I have used. One let a virus slip right by and crashed my machine.
Hamish McIntosh,22,5,the latest incarnation much-improved hardly any false alarms good program now
Yasmin Simpson,27,5,"I have used BitDefender for over 3 years and find their support excellent and the products work brilliantly too.  Any issues are resolved quickly and efficiently and best of all, it doesn’t interfere with using my computer at any time...unless it’s supposed to!"
Dave IT Tech Support,6,5,Good product with a fair price. I am using it and I have recommend it to my clients as well.
Peter,83,5,Bitdefender have developed the perfect protection for any PC - would always recommend
Alex Roldan,1,1,"I have had Bitdefender for years. Last few months my PC has been getting locked on start up. Checked everything. Called BD and they suggested upgrading to 2018. It took so long on start up for me to do anything on my PC, I'm talking 6mins+ and then there still seemed to be a lot of CPU and disk usage. Tried uninstalling BD. My PC an I5 processor is back to it's old self. Looking for a new anti virus suite. BD has gone from bad to crap as far as what it does and when it wants to do it. Support useless."
Richard Fletcher Jnr,4,1,"My first comment has to be that BitDefender software worked on my old PC Laptop.   I had no problems with the actual virus software.I DJ, and have gone to MacBooks, so imagine my surprise a year later when a DD went out of my account with BitDefender's name next to it, so when I rang them to discuss, the phone just rang and rang. Frustrated I went to the bank to stop future payments and get refunded. If you read this - BitDefender - This is a really mean practice and very underhand.   People DO change computers from time to time and its pretty nasty getting deducted money from your account from something you don't use anymore."
John Sandford,2,5,"I have used a number computer software security systems many of which provided offered total security. One in particular was very good. Unfortunately all missed the mark when it came to ""Total Security"".For two years  went away form Bitdefender and came back after two years being very dissatisfied. If a person is looking for ""Total Security"" for their computer system the only software which satisfies that requirement without any doubt is Bitdefender."
Kin Zao,1,1,"I want to put 0 star for their customer service if I can. I used to be a bitdefender customer for over 10 years. I had no issue with my 8 year old PC. I recently built a new PC and wanted to download, install and activate their software for protection. My license should be good until Aug 2018 for up to 3PCs but it showed expired when I logged in.  The software on my 8 year old PC is still activated. I called tech support for help. The first time, they did a remote access to my PC and wanted to trouble shoot my newly built PC for $80. I refused to pay this unnecessary service, then they gave me a non working billing department number to call. I called tech support again, they had to do a remote access and insisted to trouble shoot my PC for $80. When I said no for the second time, all they told me is you have a nice day, you can fix it yourself, then hand up on me. Nothing get resolved.I would not use their product again and  rather use Window defender from now on for free. I don't need to deal with this nonsense tech support from offshore."
Raphael Garcia,1,1,"I used to be a Bitdefender customer, as someone mentioned here, it was to be a great product but it started acting up, my devices would get infected. I would run full system scans and they would come back as clean yet the computers were running erratically. The turning point was when I was double tap (charged for two different policies) I had a family pack account that was long expired and I did not renewed cause I upgraded to a Total Security version. I bought the one year subscription for Total Security and shortly after that, I was billed for the family pack. It is the same company and same customer, I cannot use family pack and total security SIMULTANEOUSLY. I called and requested the refund for both subscription and went with another provider. Today I was considering switching back to Family Pack hoping that the service improved but I see the same issues seem to be happening. I will continue with other provider.I no longer have the ticket number, this happened over a year ago and there is no issue to resolve as I got my refund. Again, I was considering returning but based on the comments I see, I can understand things have not improved from the time I had my unpleasant experience and makes no sense to return. It is obvious that either there is a disconnect or philosophies with in your company does not aligned because you are acting like you are trying to address the issues but your answers are scripted and your attitude doesn't aligned with the attitude of the tech support. It is really sad to see what bitdefender has become."
Renaat Van den Broeck,2,5,"I installed Bitdefender more than a year ago, the protection works to my complete satisfaction.I needed once the customer support - they helped in a swift and correct way and solved the problem straight a way"
tash tash,1,1,"The program is rigid, it controls your system automatically instead you being able to control the program yourself.

Jonathan Hernandez,1,5,"Works great on Mac and Windows. Easy install, it does not negatively affect the computer performance and awesome client support."
Bryan Villegas,2,1,"I acquired Bitdefender this year. And from the beginning it has caused me problems, since it has NOT detected any malware.The support service is very bad, they delay in responding, and seemingly have no knowledge.I asked for my money, but Bitdefender refuses to give it to me!Ticket : 2017101015100004Still without the refund !!My money has not yet been refunded as promised by you.The ticket that answers the PayPal product's Bitdefender Plus product answers."
Steve Kent,16,1,"I've been using Bitdefender for over 10 years.This used to be the best, best AV, best support, best price, best  in every way.Something happened, after 2016 it started giving problems, now the 2018 product is unusable.I get more problems with bitdefender than with any other application or operating system.I have 10 devices covered by Bitdefender, in December at renewal I will have none.Whatever they have done to this once great product, they should undo straight away.I emailed support a few weeks ago, it took them 3 days to get back to me and all they said was uninstall Spybot.The fact that they force you to uninstall competitive products should be illegal, there is no justification for it. If it happens to be a software conflict, write better code.So, lazy support, problematic app, and now they are no longer rated best at sighting viruses.The good thing is there is plenty of choice in this area.Bye bye, Bitdefender!"
ROBERT SERBAN,3,3,Disappointed about how they act with their customers. They try to charge me 49.99 Gbp with automatically renewal. After that they have emailed me with an offer of 35  Gbp. At the end I bought it with 30. The process of buying was not very easy. I have contacted customer service to deal with that.It is not about money it is about customer service. But I think it is a practice in industry.
Andrew Chong,1,1,"Just got scammed by bit defender.. I purchase a one year license last year, and I'm positive I did not provide consent for auto renewal. Just this week, Paypal informed me that usd79 had been charged to my credit card! Bit defender without prior notice or authorization charged me for a renewal license that I did not agree to buy! Buyers beware.. I've read in many forums that bit defender is famous for doing this.. really sneaky and unethical .. I've written to them and they said it could take up to 120 days to refund me!!! I wonder why large established companies like Bit defender has to resort to such tactics..  if the company had just ask for my consent instead of automatically billing me for it, I would have probably just renewed without batting an eyelid! With such a bad experience now, I'll just look for another company that will treat their customers fairly.Edit: Order #: 64436887I'm very certain that no emails came to me about the auto renewal. I'm also a very careful online shopper and would not have auto renewed, unless a company sneakily hides the auto renewal terms and conditions or purposefully makes it so inconspicuous that customers will not notice..  if that was the intent, tell me how ethical you are attempting to treat your customers then.  The whole purpose of why conpanies have an opt out process is to hope that customers don't notice and forget about cancelling so that their orders can be auto renewed!"
Johnno,1,5,"Would I recommend Bitdefender to a friend ?. I have many times !.I have had Bitdefender for 4 years ... in all that time, only one minor threat has ever gotten through ... and that was detected on reboot and deleted.I particularly like their Safepay module for banking/CC payments etc.Any time I have had to contact them ... their response has always been quick, professional and friendly.Would I recommend Bitdefender to a friend ?.No worries Mate !.Regards from Downunder ... the Land of Kangaroos, Koalas and King Parrots ... and ... snakes, spiders and sharks.."

I started with the free version and progressively upgraded to the total security products on EVERY desktop and laptop in my home/office!

Smiki007,1,5,"I was AGV user for years, recently (last year), I've decide to change to BD, and I have no regrets for that.

Bruno Justino,1,2,"Is just bad. I don't have the best computer but I use a I3 3110m 2,4ghz, 8gb ram, 2TB hd, win 10 64 bit should not be that bad. BitDefender is just terrible slow. Out of nowhere it will consume 100% of your hd, and a lot of memory and cpu.It blocks a lot of things that shouldn't block and don't have a easy way to ""unblock"".I used Bitdefender on 2014 and 2015 and was amazing. But this Bitdefender 2018 total security is just terrible. I would not recommend it even to my enemies."

Terry,1,1,"I am one of the many that are having issues with the latest release of TS 2018 and the issues it has, I have two issues one being the ATD (Automatic threat defense) does not function correctly in Win7 so it had to be disabled, Next the latest release has issues with running PIA (Private internet access) and will cause PIA to keep disconnecting. The issue with the ATD as reported back in mid July and no path or fix as of yet, The PIA issue has been reported by PIA themselves and no fix on it either.I then made the switch to Kaspersky after being told by Bitdefender that one of my options was get to get a refund of my remaining time left on my subscription and find another program that fits my system better.So now Bitdefender changed their minds and refuses to give me a refund, Tell me one thing and then refuse to do it, Great customer service Bitdefender.Here is the email from the tech gal and her message to me, Notice at the bottom they say they will refund my money and I can get another program that better fits me."" Hello Terry,Let us please begin by apologizing for this issue you are facing and for the delayed reply. We understand this is a very delicate situation.Advanced Threat Defense is currently affected by a bug and the Bitdefender developers are trying to investigate and solve this matter as soon as possible.Since only Windows 7 computers are affected, a quick fix would be to upgrade for free to Windows 10 by following the guideline available on the Microsoft website:If you don't want to upgrade to Windows 10, as a workaround you can consider installing Bitdefender 2016 using the kit below, to protect the system until our developers sort the issue. At that time we will also extend the validity of your Bitdefender subscription to compensate for the time when Bitdefender 2018 did not work as designed:Use the same Central account to activate the subscription.Last but not least, we can issue a refund on your Bitdefender purchase so you can choose another antivirus program that will better suit your PC.Please let us know how would you like to proceed and we will act accordingly.Sincerely,Narcisa Cocei Technical Support Engineer""Ticket no: 2017082205330002Edit: So I was told I would get a refund on Oct 4th and today being the 13th that would be 9 days and still no refund processed, You know the true character of the company always shows itself not when something is going right but when something goes wrong. Now it seems they can't figure out why I didn't get any refund. They suggested I call my bank which I did and they see nothing as well as I. Well if it is never sent it will never show on the account. Come on Bitdefender you have to have someone there that actually cares about the customer and can give a simple refund."
Maximilian,1,5,"Very good, never had any viruses since my new pc build, going for my third renawal :D"
Tom U,1,2,"BitDefender 2018 has become a big disappointment. First, why do SW Mfgs feel that they have to screw around with the design and feel of their program every year?If you've used it in the past, you'll be wondering where features have vanished, ones that you must tweak.I assist 5 small businesses with their networks. I've recommended BitDefender for nearly a decade. Now, I'm looking for alternatives. Why? Support is horrible.One client has a Sonicwall VPN between offices. I used to go to Firewall, exceptions, etc. and whitelist the internal IP addresses. Ditto for their printer. Well, they've moved the feature.I looked around and found the new location. Irratating but I can live with it.It works with the printer but not the VPN. The addresses are whitelisted, even the ports. It 'works' but stops when rebooting. The settings have not changed.I called support, waited and then had to be passed around.Ultimate problem, they can't fix it. I'm asked to send in a log and they'll get back to me. Ha! So, I've had to disable the firewall so that they can work. I call back, and they want another log ... We don't have weeks for them to screw around looking for a fix. They do not take our problems seriously.Another client runs an old VB6 program. I've whitelisted it. Still won't work. Support call and, you guessed it, send in a log and they will get back to us. Didn't happen.The product itself, other than reinventing the interface every year, is quite good. God help you though if you ever need support.So, it's back to the review process and search to find a product that offers real support in a timely manner.FYI, I've found that email attachments with Ransomeware and other goodies will get through. Diligence is still required."

Konstantinos,3,5,"I am extremely impressed with the performance (both in terms of finding viruses, as you can see from their av-test benchmark, and in terms of the system performance which is unaffected), the price point (which covers all my computers and mobile devices) and customer support which is excellent ( I had to contact them about an issue, I only had to explain myself once and they patched the software in short order and gave me three months free as compensation).

Roy MacDonald,15,3,"After being a loyal and happy bitdefender customer for many years we upgraded to total protection and put to autorenewal, at an annual cost of about £30ish, this year they took £180 out bank account over 4 payments in two days leaving bank account overdrawn and despite live chats with them over 24 hours more payments were taken. 2 computers in a private residence paying narly £200 for antivirus, really? be very careful allowing this company to have your card details and autorenewal - it could go up by 600%Money was refunded and two stars raised------------------------------------------------In response to your reply, it seems when we reported you to VISA they told us you did the same LAST YEAR and we didn't notice!My son Stuart had an account with you two years ago  on basic package and not on auto-renew, he said to me that he had been offered a great deal with you and if I didnt renew my antivirus with other company he could do my pc my laptop and his PC for cheaper with bitdefender which was ""great,"" I agreed and he took bigger package on auto renew. last year (unknown to us) and this year you auto- renewed avery package we had! we several times spoke with your support and told tham and you still took money so this was no longer a mistake this was deliberate,Accounts you charged for 2 years - I believe well over £300 for 2 years home use antivirus protection on 3 PCs was on the following order numbers.63711018, 63890905, 63698743Please cancel all these as instructed several days ago on support as we have no need for an antivirus company that we can no longer trust,-------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for your response, what a shame it had to come to this. My son rated your company very highly and honestly recommended you to myself and others.  Despite numerous messages to your company you still made him seriously overdrawn at the bank for services that he never knew he had and definitly never needed.Thank you again for your response."
Slimane Layadi,1,5,"As a product, it is a great product to protect your computers, but my experience with a refund that i am waiting for, since many days, lets me give just 3 stars to this company. I purchased Bitdefender last year from an official seller who is Avangate and i removed the auto renew from the site of avangate, but this year i was surprised Bitdefender took 89$ from my Paypal account without athorisation. What i'm seeking now is my refund from Bitdefender. They sent me an email saying they are looking at my case, but i didn't receive any answer till now.Hi Bitdefender,Thank you for answering so fast.My order number is 62714697.Hi, As i mentioned before Bitdefender is a great choice to protect yourself, your family or your business from cybercriminals. But the issue of renewing my subscription automatically made me give 3 stars to the product.Bitdefender credited me back and i'm quite satisfied. I hope Bitdefender remove this autorenew option from all accounts. It should be defaulted to No autorenew. Anyway thanks to Bitdefender for their nice job. I'm giving you the full five stars."

It covers all bases from general to Family and my own personal internet Security. I have tried many security suits over the years and can safely say that Bitdefender ranks among the very best for Security and peace of mind.  It's a little pricey but then what's not in this day and age !.  Everything worthwhile in life requires effort !'. And other people's time and geneous , their products costs money.  And before I forget,  just let me also add that my personal experience with their Customer Service was also second to none. Go for it would be my advice to anyone I love and care about.   😀"

Tmod,2,3,"I have been a user of Bitdefender Total Security for quite some years now, While in the past up to Total Security 2017 my experience was good and I trusted the product with the new release of Total Security 2018 I feel Bitdefender dropped the ball.There is an issue with Win 7 and Advanced Threat Defense in that you cannot enable it, What good is a top of the line security program if you have to disable features to make it work? Bitdefender told me I am still protected so does that mean that ATD does absolutely nothing to begin with and is just a slider.As far as tech support they are pretty much useless as I have contacted them a few times and each time I got a different answer to the same issue. So in closing in the past I would have recommended them but I find it difficult to recommend a program where you have to disable features to get it to work with the OS."
Teresa Bright,1,5,"I switched to Bitdefender because my last AV didn't work.  Something got through it and I had to go in and fix it myself.  Why?  Because the company took too long to address the issue.  So far,  I have complete confidence in Bitdefender and have already recommended it to others."
Fred,1,1,"BitDefender became a malicious attack on my computer. After 4 hours with a tech person we finally uninstalled BitDefender. PROBLEM SOLVED IMMEDIATELY. I now used another product. Bitdefender's answer to the problem? We will refund the remainder of your contract $. Wouldn't do a thing about 4 hours of tech time. For the skeptics - YES it was BitDefender.Also service was almost non-existent. Got the usual company blah, blah, blah."
Lawrence Davis,1,1,"I purchased Bitdefender Internet Security 2013 (PC Lifetime Edition, 1PC)On 09-08-17, I called Bitdefender customer support because the above software had expired. I received a response via email from the support staff, stating that the software had a expiration of 5-years. I sent copies of the invoice; which doesn't state any expiration date. When I called Bitdefender again, I spoke to a representative who stated, per staff..the software license was from 09-01-12 to 08-31-17, because that's considered the life of a computer. As a consumer, this should be inscribed in the terms of agreement and on the invoice at the time of the purchase. When you use the term Lifetime, a lot of people will think the lifetime of the computer or company. This policy is unfair and misleading."
Jennifer Robinson,4,1,"Some malware has gotten through my BD defense (windows 10).  My PC is pretty much unusable because ads pop up everywhere.  I've been trying to get this fixed through BD support for three weeks.  They just send automated messages for the most part.  Their techs do EVENTUALLY respond when you send in a log file(which is a pain to generate when your system is failing).  They eventually sent me a recipe to fix my problem.  I followed the instructions, complicated steps, and it fixed the problem for 36 hours.  Now the same problems are back.  USELESS!!!!"

Abdulla,5,5,"The best all-in-one security software I've ever used. I use Total Security and it continuously updates throughout the day to keep the virus database up to date. It even updated the software from 2017 to 2018 version for free.There are numerous yet crucial features including my favorite Wallet which gives you the option to store your personal details including credit card, website log-ins, and home address. You can enter them manually or automatically. I also use their Android app which gives me a better control over which apps can be accessed on which Wifi networks.I highly recommend it for a complete security system."

I finally gave up and just deleted everything and moved on. Nine months later I  get notification that they will be auto renewing my subscription.  I called support and they said they will now have to create a ticket to disable auto renew. I'm going to have to dispute the charges on my credit card now. Do you want to put yourself in a position to have to deal with the headache of a company that is very slow to react with a program that may not work. Go to someone else.
Paul Tomicek,1,1,"Absolutely frustrating to remove. Uninstaller did not work on either on my computers. I have to go into the code to remove the software. Software pops up daily to remind you about your subscription. Once subscription expires, it won't remove.  Technical support links didn't help and also sent annoying reminders about my ""open ticket"". Finally they told me I had to go into the programing to remove it!"
Paul,3,5,I find this security suite to be well presented and most importantly does not slow down your machine. It picks up most problems and is easy to use and customise if required. The autopilot mode does most things for you... good value for 5 devices.
D C,1,5,The best antivirus and web protection/firewall I have ever used. I have been a Bitdefender user from 2006 and  have never had any problems. The best feature of this product is that it does not take all the resources of your device like many other antivirus products in the market does which slows down the machine drastically...I never felt any slowness with Bitdefender on my machine. And the virus engine is best in the market.
Roger Tyler,13,5,"I have cancelled my subscription with BullGuard because of the attitude of the tech, such an arrogant person, which has cost them a repeat order.Why do I have to press one for  English when you're just gonna transfer me to someone I can't  understand anyway?*"
Karan S. Raghwa,2,5,"Excellent, great experience. I will always recommend Bitdefender to all my friends."
Grete Schmitz,1,5,Nice working Antivirus
Lee Morris,1,5,They are down to earth and truly back their product 100%. The product itself is one of the easiest anti-virus programs to use. once installed turn on auto-pilot and let it go. I find it works better than McAffee or Norton. Bit defender is the only system I will use.
Werner,1,2,"Had some questions recently and learned that the help service sends every time the same standard sentence, it starts - - ""we are sorry for the delay of our answer and we hope to assist you in a timely fashion from now on"" next time is the same and nothing is changing. The problem looks like insignificant for them and wont be answered properly. I figured it out my self after a while.I like the Bitdefender solution but won't accept ones more this disaster.Ticket #:  2017080904450001"
Leo Graper,14,5,Top notch software and also great support!
Jasper,7,5,Great anti-virus program with a lot of added features for your computer.
David Lott,1,1,"I bought Bitdefender antivirus Mac without a trial period. Started using it and realized at the end of 30 days that I had a trial copy. Called support and they told me I had ordered Bitdefender for Windows. Support said they could not help me and that I had to go to ""sales"" to switch to the proper program. They sent a ""priority"" ticket to sales. That was 4 days ago and nobody has contacted me. Can't go back to ""support"" because it's not in their jurisdiction. ""Sales"" not responsive. I do not plan to use them even though I have paid for a year of service that I can not use. Untrustworthy. Disorganized."
mukesh prajapati,1,5,"Satisfactory customer supportSatisfactory product experience which has low footprint and latest features. After installing BitDefender Total Security, the risk of infection/ malware/etc is mitigated to a great extent."
Barry McGrath,3,1,"Bought a copy and received a confirmation email.  Apparently they don't keep close track of their sales,  Tier zero brain dead support.Ask yourself-do you really have the time to deal with another company like this?"
Michael MS,2,5,Easy to install. All the features you're ever likely need. Consistently rated best in testing. Install on many devices. Quite often discounted pricing.
Vanessa Van Schoick,6,1,When Bitdefender first came out it was better. Now I have people trying to sell me downloads of Bitdefender and ripping me off. They have gotten greedy. I will never purchase Bitdefender again because they took 100.00 out of my account without permission. It is a scary place we live when so many vultures can get ahold of bank accounts online.
B,40,4,"I'm not going to renew my subscription after this year.The product is fine, Total Internet Security 2018.The AV-app is trying to control my google blocklist and I dont know how to disable this option. After going through a sheer number of demotivating ""Help-Yourself""-support-pages with no email or contact info, I had to guess on the (obvious) support email, but got an automated reply saying the email account is basically a garbage can. There is an online form supporting upload of screenshots, but it does not seem to work and gets stuck.I doubt Bitdefender just want to be left alone and would rather not be bothered by customers? Make no mistake, Bitdefender's free and paid versions of Bitdefender is - and has always been - awesome. They really make the best antivirus software out there. But their website sucks and it's really hard to get in contact with them."
Harrison,1,4,"BitDefender is definitely a solid product. Ransomware protection, internet security, it's all there. BitDefender does lack zero-day detection however, even though it has live protection on site, it will not detect any new threats that are 1-14 days new compared to a select few AVs. Not to mention, it can also be quite the resource hog and has a process that cannot be ended.It's also on the costy side if you're being very watchful about your money.Other then that, it excels quite well for any well known threat. I do hope that it will improve its signatures and not solely rely on its own live protection, as some forms of malware can do nasty things before it gets detected by the AV."
Larry Staudmeister,2,5,"There my be others out there who say they can do what Bitdefender does, but I have used Bitdefender's Total Security Package for several years with complete satisfaction. Their Customer support is teriffic the few times I have needed them. Rapid responses, accurate analyses, and prompt solutions set them apart. I have no reason to look elsewhere."
Jan-Erik Ek,7,5,"Bitdefender Total Security is the best computer security program I`ve used. I`ve tried several others, but Bitdefender beats them with options, the user friendlyness, the different functions, no false alarms, don`t slow down my computer at all.I use Bitdefender Total Security on my PC, my laptop (Windows) and my Android phone, and they work just perfect.I can really recommend Bitdefender Total Security!"
Saif,4,4,I bought my total security 2018 on sale very light and fast great features am a gamer so i needed an antivirus with these qualities.Definitely recommend it but look for a bargain on the internet before you buy there is always one try PcMag or other sites for Bitdefender discount.
YURY KUZMIN,20,5,"Bitdefender Total Security 2018 - crossplatforming solution that offers protection for all popular operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android.Comprehensive antivirus ""all-in-one"" provides home users with multiple layers of protection and provides a high level of data privacy in today's world of complex hacker attacks, without compromising the performance of your computer or mobile devices."
Ashin Tharana,3,5,"In the free version that I use there is no way how to check an external device easily, such as inserted USB stick etc.Thank you :-) mSBased on the answer below I have changed the rating.Thank you very much :-)"
Steve Groff,3,1,"This is by far and wide the worst anti-virus/spam/malware, etc I have ever used.  And I bought it!  How depressing.  If you like constant notifications, a user menu that is impossible to navigate, and constantly having normal files put in 'the vault' as if they are carrying some virus, then by all means... install this software.  This is not a review on the capabilities of Bitdefender, the software is more than capable of doing everything you need it to do.  This is a review on the user interfaces.  I would rather install Norton or McAfee... and that's saying something."
Kregger,1,5,There's a reason Bitdefender is consistently rated #1:  Its the BEST. PERIOD.Forget the rest.  This is the ONE.
Ross,1,5,Very unobtrusive and I haven't had a problem in 4 years. The only issue is their marketing bot kept asking me if I wanted to update my 2015 software after I had purchased the 2017 version. That seems to have been corrected Great program!.
Ruby,1,5,"I was looking for a better layer of security for my everyday computer work and browsing...I tried McAfee, I tried Norton, and while using both of those my computer got hacked and caught viruses. So I stumbled upon Bitdefender, and now I am happy with the layer of security that I have, I've had absolutely NO problems, ZERO! I would advise anyone whose looking for something better to try Bitdefender you will NOT be disappointed!"
sl8yr,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for a while now and have had no negative issues at all, it's a very capable and effective program that happily works in the background using minimal​ system resources. HIghly recommend."
Radu Mihai Anghel,1,5,I just love it. It's my number one tool against cyber attacks.
Mihai,1,5,Very professional and good customer service.
Mike Windahl,1,5,This product was very easy to set up on both my Mac & Windows platforms & any questions that I had were promptly answered by Bitdefender's support team.
Ari Nugraha Arsitek,1,4,"Most powerfull antivirus, but more expensive..."
George L.,2,2,"If the product works properly, it's fine. But God help you if you need tech support.. Horrible. Empty promises. They ask you to spend your time generating report and after report and then never respond. Repeated phone calls, emails, no avail. Support sucks."
YUVRAJ SINGH,2,4,"best detection ever with this antivirus loads of features available like ransom ware protection, safe pay , very fast detection speed , can scan network port , protects from most of the virus ,worms , Trojans, etc . Only problem is the boot time decreases and takes a minute or two for the application to load after booting and sometimes it also blocks software which are not malware and have to stop or exclude it from scanning . It sometimes fails to block prompt webpage ."
Carl-Ivar Törnqvist,3,5,"This is the best security software. I have tried a lot of other brands but Bitdefender are the best. And the support crew if you ever need to contact them are top notch. So don't hesitate. Download, install and have a piece of mind."
Alya,1,5,"I have been using BitDefender Total Security for over 5 years now. Every year when the renewal date is near I do a search on the internet and read all of the reviews about the PC security packages available on the market. As far as I know the security packages on the market allows you to download and install their package to let you try and then buy.  So every year before I renew the subscription to BitDefender I download the other security packages on the market to see if this time they are better than BitDefender. After I run the trials I again decide to arm my PC with the BitDefender Total Security. Because I am still the boss and in full control of my PC whilst BitDefender is shielding my PC. BitDefender does not overtake my PC. For over the last five years I have been using BitDefender I don't have any virus, any breakdown on my PC's firewall defences  and also whilst surfing the internet every single attack wanting to break into My PC has spectacularly failed. BitDefender has been very gentle and has been working in tandem with the Microsoft Windows Operating System (OS) I have on my PC.   Like any other machinery there are times that an app/package will stop to function properly  as it happens with BitDefender. From my experience when BitDefender stops working telling me it is unable to function properly I then know there is a serious problem with one of my Hard Disks or somewhere in the hardware components, perhaps memory card or the graphics card etc., or with the OS as one or some of the updates for the OS has not downloaded and installed properly and so on.  SO when BitDefender refuses to start up and or stops working I know there is a problem in the Hardware or with the updates I got from Microsoft. This is absolutely NOT BitDefender's failure.  For whatever reason if BitDefender stops working or does not start I begin to do a fault diagnosis on my PC and recover and fix the PC before it is too l late.When the renewal time comes, it is in my best interest to make sure all of the previous installation of the BitDefender are completely removed from my system. This is because of the choices I made the way I decided to configure my PC.   Like other people I had the same problems I was unable to download and install BitDefender on my PC it was very distressing. So again I did a lot of search on the internet read through the geeks blogs and so on and I learned that, perhaps very rightly, Microsoft prefers to have the monopoly over certain things and doesn't give permission to the main users like BitDefender to access certain parts of the OS in order for the BitDefender to do the thorough cleaning/installation process.  So I learned how to manually gentle clean my registry and so on since I have been having issues with the OS and it has been pain to do the OS updates around that time. I realized that I cannot blame BitDefender or perhaps any other security package for those difficulties/failures. I also realized that I can easily get out of this sticky situation with BitDefender without having to reinstall the OS in the worst situation. Thankfully once I searched the BitDefender's site for answers and followed the steps and then run BitDefender's own removal tool and my own OS maintenance on my own PC I have the BitDefender up and running faster than the lightning. It is my responsibility to have a clean OS and not BitDefender's. Contrary to the other security packages, so far BitDefender has not messed up my system or any other installation on my system in any way whilst installing and or uninstalling. I am still the boss and in control of my PC.Initially it was very daunting for me to use the BitDefender's Safepay, Vault and Wallet because I was reluctant to learn how to use the features. Imagine you are buying a car with lots of powerful features and you are scared to even acknowledge those powerful features let alone to at least try. Is that sound good? No. Again it is my responsibility and choice to arm myself with the knowledge. So once I read the manual, the online tips and bits and I become to ""know how"" it is just a matter of clicking at the button and I am whoopeed into this private one to one tunnel to do my on line shopping, to logon to my accounts and so on without any worry in the world. Even Amazon recognises and accepts BitDefender Total Security as a safe customer Account logon facility from the customers desktop PC.From my experience I know very well when I don't get a response from BitDefender support immediately to solve the problem I have, I know that there is a serious problem with my PC which is not BitDefender's fault and I begin the diagnosis and the fix.  This may well be the case for the other security packages but again from my experience BitDefender is a silky gentle giant fiercely protecting/guarding my PC while letting me be the BOSS of my PC. I was denied to be the BOSS from the other security packages I tried. If I am not the BOSS then how on earth I am going to be able to fix my own PC without making serious changes to the existing setup. I am able to use the same PC and Hardware for at least five years with BitDefender installed on, only changing the Hard Disk (HD) that has physical failures and it happened with two HDs so far.As long as I am the BOSS and the BitDefender is my silky gentle giant Armour I decide to wear in the way I want to I shall carry on using BitDefender Total security. English is not my first language but the above should be good enough to express my view."
Poul Henning Christensen,4,1,"The last two years I have bought Bitdefender Antivirus plus and it seems that they still do not have sufficient control over their handling of accounts. Like last year I have recieved to mails from Bitdefender/Avangate, to my two different mailboxes - in the first mail Bitdefender/Avangate wrote to me that my account will be automaticly renewed: the amount 39,95 EUR (last year they promised that this automatic renewal would not happen again!) - in the second mail Bitdefender/Avangate wrote to me that my account soon will expire and that I have the possibility to buy a new years service for the amount og Bitdefender/Avangate wrote to me that my account 29,95 EUR. Yesterday I contacted the Bitdefende support regarding the problems but they send me to Avantgate Support. Then I wrote to Avantgate Support and I have not heard anything from them. What a mess!!In the answer (below) from Bitdefender they write that ""the auto-renewal option was indeed completely disabled last year"" this is not right because I recieved few days ago a mail where Bitdefender wrote: ""Your Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2016 expires on 2017-08-17. Your account is set for auto-renewal, so you enjoy continous protection"". So it is not correct that the auto renewal was cancelled last year."
Tucker,1,2,"I got Bitdefender about 4 or 5 months ago I believe, and have quite a number of issues with it. This review is more an attempt to share my experience to potentially help other users with similar issues, rather than just a rant. Also, I suppose if the company would like to use my comments as suggests for improvements, that would be great. =) I am specifically reviewing Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2017 and 2018.First off, for the positives, I chose Bitdefender because it was highly rated and marked as performing well at catching potential attacks by several websites I tend to turn to for such things (Tomshardware, etc). I have no way of testing it myself really, but I haven't gotten any malware that I know of, so I'll assume it is working well in that regard. Bitdefender also appears to send out specific notices about large scale malware attacks, such as Wannacry, which is nice. Finally, the email based customer support had a very quick turnaround time and was helpful for fixing the issues I was having (never tried other types of customer support).Unfortunately, aforementioned customer support was very necessary. After installing Bitdefender, I kept running into little things over a few weeks that would just be immensely frustrating, yet not necessarily obviously attributable to Bitdefender. However, since Bitdefender essentially can't be turned off other than uninstalling, it is difficult to trouble shoot these things.1.) All of my desktop icons would be rearranged and occasionally deleted and items on my taskbar would all be removed maybe half the time I restarted my computer. This is apparently caused by the ransomware protection being set to protect the desktop by default, and in the 2018 version can be turned off under ""View Features -> Safe Files -> Protected Folders"".2.) I was unable to install or run a whole host of programs because they either didn't have a digital signature or Bitdefender didn't trust it. Every time I tried, a message would pop up saying it was blocked. I could click on the message and manually allow the application, but many programs would continue to be blocked anyway. Offhand, I can remember this happening with some Steam games, Amazon apps, video streaming apps, etc. Completely turning off the ransomware feature was the only way to fix this in the 2017 version, although I will say I have not had as many issues with the 2018 version.3.) I kept getting messages about special offers and random security reports (Hurray, you still don't have a virus!) that would alt-tab me out of other programs multiple times a day, despite being in ""Auto-pilot mode"" where you aren't supposed to have to think about the software at all. (I mean, it literally say ""Turn Autopilot ON for silent security"".) The frequency of it was just annoying as hell. They can be turned off in ""Settings -> General"", although in my opinion they should be off by default.4.) Web browsing became very slow and at times unusable. Webpages would either take much longer to load, never load, or pop up a screen saying the website wasn't secure (even on sites like Google). This is apparently due to the ""Scan SSL"" feature, which can be disabled under ""View Features -> Web Protection -> Settings (the little gear)"" in the 2018 version.5.) After a few months with the 2017 version, I noticed my computer was using a huge amount of memory even while idling. I eventually discovered the culprit to be vsserv.exe, which is part of Bitdefender. It was consistently using 7-10 gb of memory or more at all times, and would occasionally spike up and completely freeze my computer, requiring a hard restart. I don't know if there was a bad patch pushed out or what, but it basically made my computer unusable with Bitdefender installed. Customer support had me completely uninstall, then install the 2018 version, which seems to have fixed the problem for now, although I had to go remember what all those features I mentioned above were and figure out how to get them disabled again. (Since the 2018 version is free if you have a subscription to the 2017 version, why not just push the update out to all users automatically? Also, its only halfway through 2017, why are we are a 2018 version?)I suppose problems 1-3 could be chalked up to personal preference to some degree, but problems 4 and 5 basically destroyed important functionalities of my PC. A mix of customer support and Google searches got it all fixed, but I really just can't recommend software that requires so much babying yet has such deep access and control over your computer. Possible ways to improve some of this might include: a more in-depth initial set-up that explains what all the features are with potential downsides and lets you choose what you want on or off; an improved user interface that makes it easier to find things, possibly with the addition of a search feature (I'd like to see a master list of all settings rather than have them scattered all over the place); the ability to actually turn Bitdefender off in order to trouble shoot problems (I know you can turn modules off, but the program itself is essentially impossible to kill, even with taskkill); and improved answers to the common problems faq on the Bitdefender website (I would sometimes find the answer to what I needed, but the explanation for how to do it was for another product and I couldn't find any explanation for the product I actually cared about).So long story short, I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the customer support was rather good, but be warned that this may not end up being an easy to use, install-and-forget antivirus."
r allen,1,2,"I have used bitdefender since 2010 and never had any problems on four different computers . But in the last 3 weeks after installing 2018 total security that all changed , Many systems and programs failed to work or worked improperly , including bitdefender . About 7 hours in total was spent with remotely connected techs  Carbonite techs couldn't find a reason  ( three attempts ). Support .com tried several times to fix bitdefender  but mostly worked on other problems ( unsuccessfully ).  Microsoft tech was unsuccessful, he said he had to escalate the case which would cost $149.00  .  But the bitdefender techs were just a bad joke . I'm not an expert but I can see when someone is trying to look like they are doing something and actually they are doing nothing constructive. The  Bitdefender techs showed me a page in the computer that was full of errors and warnings of course  it had warnings because the computer was corrupt with malware ,That says a lot about bitdefender. but he promised it could be fixed for a one time fee of $149.00. Now I smell a rat. . All the techs disabled bitdefender  but that didn't  fix it. I removed bitdefender  and reinstalled it at least 5 times but that didn't fix it . Finally I removed it and installed a higher reviewed malware total protection that has better more useful features   Now all my computers are working better than ever . I do not recommend the 2018 bitdefender total security and I will never use it again"
R. Christiansen,2,5,"Got a renewal for Bitdefender mobil Phone  through Google Play, but didn't got an activation code. Contacted Bitdefender costumer service, they activated the renewal plus they extended my subscription with an extra year. Thumbs up."
Paul F Jordan,1,2,"Bit Defender free was installed by my pc consultant when I rebuilt my computer last year.  It worked great for a year, but last week I got a splash screen to renew.  When I tried to do this, I found I could not renew my free subscription.  I created a user account but when I attempted to renew my Free Bit Defender, it failed to authhorize.  Support would not repond to my ticket as Free does not receive support.  Ok...so I purchased Plus and I have found it to be a very heavy and intrusive program: mouse issues, can not scrub on you tube, etc.  When I tried to turn off Plus, I found this is not possible without navigating several windows.  When I recontacted support to see if I could back to free, they did not know.  IMO-- BD free is awesome,  BD plus is a very heavy intrusive program recalling the late nineties Norton Utilities."
Dave Mac,7,5,Have used Bitdefender on my home PC's for many years with no issues whatsoever. I decided to try an annual subscription of Bitdefender mobile security for my Android phone and have been pleasantly surprised with the ease of use and protection offered. Had a small issue with invoice showing monthly subscription instead of annual subscription which was very quickly resolved by the excellent customer service. I now have complete peace of mind when using all my devices.
Patrick,3,5,I hope that Bitdefender soon becomes available for my iPad2.
Angela Wilson,3,5,I have been using Bitdefender for over a year now on my Mac's and I love it. The product is easy to use and works quietly in the background keeping them safe. The customer service team are also very good if you need help.
Celeste Dowell,1,1,"Until yesterday, I was very satisfied with Bitdefender. However, yesterday, Bitdefender successfully blocked a potential ransom ware attack on my files, which was great. But in the process, it blocked my access to Outlook. I had an online chat with an associate who advised me that the reason was because I was running an old version of Bitdefender and needed to update to Internet Security 2018, which he helped me do. I STILL am unable to unlock my Outlook files, sent two followup emails to Bitdefender letting them know this, and still have not received a response back from Bitdefender on how I can unlock them. Please help me as I desperately need to access those files. My Chat Ticket # from yesterday is: 2017072722240002. Thank you."

Nick Rogger,1,5,I use Bitdefender many years now and i had never any virus or malware problems. The support is great. I got fast and usefull help. In my oppinion Bitdefender is the go to Securitysoftware and i recommendet it to a lot of   friends.
Jim Skulstad,1,2,"I renewed my Bitdefender AntiVirus annual license fee through the standard process of entering my credit card info on their website and approving the chargers through the usual process.  The next screen that automatically appears makes it look like you should hit the green button to download the software you just purchased.  However, what it is really doing is selling another service, Bitdefender Install & SetUp - 1 intervention.  When you hit the green button, it does NOT take you to the usual credit card approval screen, but instead automatically bills the card previously used for the antivirus order.  When I called their customer service number to have this charge removed a minute or two after this second charge appeared in my email account,  the Bitdefenders customer service rep said they would have to send my request through an internal review process and then send me an email explaining the process I would need to follow to determine if a refund would be provided. This whole process looks like a deliberate attempt to first mislead customers into ordering products they never intended to buy AND then make it difficult to get a refund once the consumer realizes they have been tricked into purchasing a product/service that they did not intend to buy and never approved the charge for.7/17/2017 -- Follow-up on Bitdefender's Comments to My Post.Thank you for you fast response.  Per your instructions in that post ... I contacted your customer service department and provided the order ID information when I called yesterday requesting the refund.  Regarding the rest of your response related to the pricing being presented for the Install and Setup services ... that may be true, but that is not the issue I was raising in my original comment.  The issue is the way Bitdefender has designed the payment process to potentially mislead customers into buying services they don't want or need.  I originally entered my credit card information and approved the payment for renewal of my anti-virus software.  The next thing I needed to do was install the update.  The screen you present after the payment is Not information on how I can install it (which is what users are expecting), but it is for a service (that cost more than my renewal fee) for Bitdefender to install it for me. I am not sure why this service is even needed since I now know the only thing required to install the renewal is simply entering an activation code in the Bitdefender application on my PC.  However, what appears after the payment screen is big green button related to installing the renewal.  This makes it look like the next step after payment is to download the renewal software BUT in reality Bitdefender is selling more services.  If you select this button, it does not take you to a credit card screen to confirm you want to complete the second transaction.  Instead it automatically use the credit card info saved from the prior transaction and bills your credit card for this additional service.  I found out this had occurred only when a second email showed up from Bitdefender listing an additional charge that I wasn't expecting. Retaining my credit card info and automatically charging my account without confirming with me that I want this service is not a good business practice."

Dr Alan  Moore,18,4,"I've just revised the score up to four stars after a miserable couple of weeks trying to get Bitdefender antivirus to work properly on a Mac running Mojave. Finally got it sorted, but BD customer services weren't very helpful in giving advice to downgrade to a previous operating system, that's the easy option for them and shows a lack of understanding of what customers really want, which is a product that works on all the latest versions. However, they did agree to extend my subscription to cover the period when it would not work, so I appreciate that.  I've been runnning Bitdefender on Macs since 2017 and there have been a number of issues that led me to previously give reduced ratings, but eventually the problems were sorted and I revised to score.  This lastest issue began early in April 2019, in a nutshell, Bitdefender AntiVirus for Mac has not been compatible with all versions of Mac Mojave, and the usual situation arose where the developers blame Apple and Apple blame the developers. Anyway, it's working again after some updates and it appears to comply with Apple's developer requirements."
Rastus Cormac,1,5,"Excellent customer service and an excellent product, I would recommend bitdefender o anyone looking for exceptional protection."

Rejean Marseille,2,5,when there is bad malware around they take care of it fast
Ed,1,3,"I had used Bitdefender for a year on my Mac computer. It worked as expected.  When my subscription was expiring, I purchased a renewal subscription for $39.99.  Installing the new subscription was anything but routine.  When I contacted Bitdefender, they required I download a program called TeamViewer to help with the installation.  The technician had taken care of the problem, but Bitdefender charged me an additional $39.99 without my consent or knowledge.  They initially would not refund my second charge.  Upon several follow up email discussions, we did settle on extending my subscription for an additional 1 year. Please beware of this condition and hopefully Bitdefender will improve their renewal process and make life easier for all of us."
MW,16,5,"Very good value, excellent protection."
Nick Wright,1,3,"Anti Virus - Great, doesn`t use too much overheads and is inobtrusive and configurable.Anti-Spam - No noticeable difference.Firewall - OK but no discernable advantages over native windows firewall.Anti-Theft - Top marks for this, provides remote disable/locking of files, remote control of web cam, etc, and geolocation info.Disk clean up - can be problematic as it makes it all too easy to delete needed files, the native windows disk clean up is much safer.Parental advisor - One click optimizer & Start up Optimizer -  Ho humm, these CAN be convienient but can disable needed programs if you don`t know what you are doing.File Vault and encryption - I felt this was a superfluous tool, it`s nice to have a super-secure place for files but I`d much rather ALL my files were protected properly negating the need for a ""special place""...Ransomware Protection - was absolutely dismal. It seems to work on the theory that if it blocks EVERY single program that starts up then ransomware won`t get through, I HAD to turn it off and disable it in order for my PC and programs to function properly at all.Price:- I paid £30 GBP for 5 devices for one year, which is a good deal. although I have to add that if you decide to purchase this, it will automatically renew after a year and will recharge your credit card unless you specifically disable that option when purchasing, or do so  later by opening an account with the vendor, entering your order number and navigating to a (hard to find), setting. Bitdefender have taken a lot of flak for this practice.Summary:- Bitdefender is a highly rated antivirus and will serve you well provided you configure it properly, but I felt that it tried to bundle too many un-needed bells and whistles. Speaking for myself, I disabled or don`t use most of the additional features starting with the Ransomware protection which I thought was more of a severe hindrance than help or protection. That said, at the current price, it`s a good buy if you can put up with its ideosyncracies."
richard elderfield,8,5,"I am very pleased with Bitdefender total security ;It is doing it's job to block ransome virus,plus all the other nasties out there .I would definatley recommend Bitdefender products."
Hank,2,5,"After an initial mishap during installation, I contacted BitDefender and they were with me all the way and made sure I was happy. Excellent after sale service and backup of their product. Well done keep it up!!"
Kurt H,35,5,"Excellent software..!I'm not worried a second while browsing online because I know my PC is protected.I had an old machine running the software and deliberately provoked a virus attack by surfing questionable sites. Not a single thing got through, as I verified the registration database with the original."
Henry Blom,1,5,"Great program, and so far SO good!"
Paul,5,5,Seems to be working well. Notified me that latest ransomeware virus has been identified.
Jan H,7,5,Simple and safe.I haven't experienced any infections for years and the occasional problem i encountered was intercepted by my software.Highly recommended.
Ron Ward,1,5,
suerei,1,5,in my experience has proven to be an excellent system at a very reasonable cost
Mike,8,5,"I have used Bitdefender for a good 8 years now. I have never - I repeat, NEVER - had any kind of intrusion, virus attack, security issue, NEVER. Hands down this is the best computer security software available. As a bonus, there have been times when I've been simply paranoid about something and contacted customer support and they were outstanding. This will be the best money you've ever spent on antivirus/internet security EVER, PERIOD. While everybody else sweats the latest virus attack, etc. I'm sailing smoothly along. BTW, I'm not a shill. I happily pay their price, for multiple years at a time. I just appreciate a great product when I get to use one."
Terry Congdon,3,5,Excellent product and service - as always!
Angelhaze Hendrix,1,5,I feel always sfe with Bitdefender and nothing to do.It is fantastic.

Sharni Jayaratna,1,5,Amazing program and very affordable. Currently using the three user version for 2017. Very light and powerful software.
Virgil,8,5,"I used to have Panda free anti-virus but got a tad fed up with the pop ups, so I decided to check out other free antivirus downloads and stumbled upon Bitdefender during the NHS ransomware hit. I'm feel confident that I am protected now that I have installed it on my PC."
Daniel Mutua,1,5,Bitdefender responds quickly and accurately when contacted on real or perceived security breach.
Parthasarathy M,1,4,"Bitdefender protects our system well. We do not need to worry about Virus and Ransomware attacks.Only concern is, it is slow on PCs with less memory. If this could be improved, it would be great."
John Bradshaw,1,5,The best and most helpful security program available.Do not miss this.Cannot recommend highly enoughThanks
Lawrence A. Siler,1,5,"Since I installed the product there were times when malware or some virus was trying to attack my computer I was warned and the problem was eliminated. Before installing the product I had another one installed that I was definitely not happy with. After I installed Bitdefender  it has kept my computer safe and I no longer have the issues prior to its installation.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to keep their computer safe.Sincerely,Lawrence Siler"
Joseph Jerminario,2,5,Bitdefender is one of the best security companies for computers. Always staying on top of the latest internet attacks such as ransomware and vuruses. Bitdefender does not slow down your system like some other security suites. Bitdefender the company you should be using to protect you and your family from the nasties of the internet world.
Jack Rigby,1,5,"I run some ""Politically Incorrect"" commentaries on my Websites and so regularly get attacked by crazies.BitDefender  *regularly* saves my business and NetLife. It works.YOU need it.MILLIONS of computers are being attacked by vicious people ""for fun""  and can destroy family records, lives, businesses every day now.  No, I'm not a salesman for the product, just a grateful survivor!"
Steven,15,5,"Fantastic product that protects my Work and Home computers. Bitdefender does not slow my computer down like my previous Anti-Virus did which begins with a ""K"" did.Also it is great to have Anti-Malware/Ransomeware protection built in as well!Best computer protection I have ever used!"
Jennifer Segerius,1,5,
Eldon Bryant,1,5,My three [3] home computers have been successfully protected from unsolicited and unwanted viruses etc etc for a number of years and both I and the computers are very grateful.
Simon Domingo,5,5,"Been using for 4 years now, so far so good. Never had an issue."
Yogesh Kumar,1,5,"This is the best antivirus i have ever used.It is way better then kaspersky,symantec and mcafee.I  would recommand this company to everyone.One can buy and set Bitdefender in auto-pilot mode and forget about the security of your device,It will protect our device against every threat whether virus,malware or ransomware.It provides top notch security for your devices.It is best in class......"
Peter Frensch,1,5,"Perfect anti virusscanner! Be protected against 😈 all day long...day after day! Never encountered any problems. Easy to set up is Bitdefender from the start and convenient in using. Don't save perhaps a bit less money, but just get yourself a excellent anti virusscanner. Highly recommended 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟‼️"
Mike Price,8,5,Good value and low impact to operating system.
Ilona Endsor,13,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for several years now, first on all my Windows  running pc's, phone's etc and now on all my apple pc's, tablet's phone's etc. The Help centre is brilliant as well as using the wallet. I highly recommend it , prices are really great if you search on the web, do not renew licence you can get it cheaper if you buy new every time."
Rob,7,2,"I purchased 3 licences from Bitdefender. One for windows 10, one for windows 7 and one for windows XP.  The XP version has been a problem from day one and I have to keep on running the uninstall/repair functionality. Literally every other day as it keeps on reporting the database hasn't been updated and the fix functionality fails every time. Luckily I have worked with PC before, as a novice would be up a creek without a paddle.The support has been a waste of time. I have not had one solution provided by them except to run the repair functionality. At the moment I think they are trying to blame Windows.I have requested a full refund but this proving to be difficult as they want to offer me a 3 month extension on software that doesn't work.4/7/17 - I have received my refund now. With regard to the response from Bitdefender about working to resolve the problem, I would suggest improving their response to customers with problems whilst they are still clients rather than once they have left. I have though moved it to 2 stars as they weren't rude.6/7/17 - I have loads of ticket ids. This was the last one 2017061108150002 and this was the first 2017042011000007."
Faye Evans,1,5,
Ajinkya Jawalkar,1,5,Best security suite in the market. Excellent and easy to use UI. The customer support executives are extremely helpful and they have the complete savoir faire of the security issues.
Lee Chong Ming,1,1,"I bought a renewal subscription for Bitdefender Total Security and updated my subscription with the new activation code while I still have 28 days left on my previous subscription. I am surprise to see that my next expiration date for my subscription is exactly one year from the date I updated to the new activation code. I expected that my new expiration date have been added on to my remaining days left on my current subscription. In other words, I have been defrauded of 28 days on my subscription."
Mike-A-,1,1,"Product itself is awesome and I would have given 5 stars, however, after purchasing a renewal on special; I didn't receive a renewal update, a code to enter or anything. I renewed using paypal which uses a different email to my bitdefender account so bitdefender decided to make a new account instead. After emailing support, no response but the new account was no longer accessible. My old account ticked over on an auto-renewal setup (silly me). So now I've been billed for the on special renewal ($51.49) and the auto renewal ($133.85). The initial account still works but I've been screwed out of the on special deal. Seems to be a trend among companies these days in poor customer service and systems (ongoing problems still with an ex-ISP). Lesson learnt; don't setup auto renewals and don't be tempted by specials."
Richard Rick,1,5,so easy to use covers all security problems that i do not need to worry about  would recommend it to any one and i am 70
Kelly,1,1,"It is great if you never have an issue. If anything happens and you need customer service, FORGET ABOUT IT. There is no person to talk to and the endless chat sessions with no resolution are worthless. I have been waiting for 3 weeks for resolution to an issue and no one will respond."
Keith H.,1,5,"I've used all of the big virus software companies, none of which compare!  I have been running Bitdefender on my computers and devices for the last 8 years flawlessly. I've had 0 issues from the beginning and I must say their customer service is first class.  I was treated quickly and fairly each time I've had to contact Bitdefender for support. The best part, the software runs silently, protects my computers and there is no throughput issues or delay.  When Bitdefender is running scans it is not a resource hog like the others.  Highly recommend them."
Jeffrey Martin,1,5,"One of the great AV systems I've ever used.  The anti-ransomware piece is a great asset.  Also, the capability to scan your system before boot using the rescue environment piece works great.  Thanks for such a great product."
b.bender Exc,1,5,I've  had no problems with Bitdefender.  I am on auto-renewal so I never have to worry.
Mr Shane Mann,14,5,"Bitdefender is by far the best AV on the market at the moment.I just renewed for a further 2 years, not had any problems at all with their software. The customer service/support team are great too.Unlike the other AV companies that only discount new customers, these guys honour loyalty and provided a handsome saving on renewing."
Tony Edney,1,2,"As my 2016 subscription was ending in about 6 weeks I took advantage of Bitdefenders early renewal offer for 2017. So, I paid my money and received my activation code but when it came time to install 2017, the window advised me that I would lose the balance of my existing subscription, which is contrary to the claims made in the renewal offer. Troubleshooting, I found no solution to the problem so I tried to create an email ticket, but when I clicked on the email ticket I was taken back to the original window so I have no way of contacting this company with my problem.  It may be a good product but the customer interface is awful."
Sergio Savic,3,1,"For my country (Serbia) they are using bait and switch method. Which should be highly illegal to use anywhere in the world. They give out one price on the website, while in the checkout (review) screen it bumps up, it's more than what they advertise.I've reported that error to their customer support, they started giving some codes for special offers. While that's all great, I don't want special offer, and I don't want to use the company that has bait and switch method as a sale technique.If it's not a sale technique, then they have pretty bad developers who can't troubleshoot the errors across the webiste. O yeah and after some time without solving the problem, they just keep on sending closing tech support ticket, like they've solved something (want to get me off their backs)"
Heikki Rautanen,3,5,"Works like a charm, easy to install, small memory print, reliable, what more one need for a quality product? Installed BD in three PC's and two phones."
Bill,2,1,"I purchased a Bitdefender 2017 license and registered the product.  Six months later I purchased a new computer.  Contacted support on how to transfer the license to a new computer because the support site was not clear.  Instead of getting help, Bitdefender revoked my license.  I have been a Bitdefender customer for over 10 years.  Not anymore.  Support/Customer Service is horrible.  Look them up on Better Business Bureau.Bitdefender you ca call it what you like license or subscription.  Regardless you do not treat customers like you did me.  I have already wasted enough time trying to get Bitdefender to understand this.  Even went as far as Florin Talpes.  Never heard back, guess Bitdefender is too busy for their customers.  Look at your ratings on Better Business Bureau.  That says enough.Bitdefender my original ticket was  2017051116440005.  You can see how much I have gone back and forth with Bitdefender.  The problem is I had already register the license/subscription 6 months (approx) ago.  If I would not have asked a simple question, it would have never been an issue.  I know this for a fact.UpdateBitdefender you can rest assure that when my license/subscription runs out you will have lost a customer.  It is not my fault you cannot manage your license/subscriptions.  I know another machine that is using the same license/subscription and they do not have a problem.  See the license/subscription was good for 3 PCs/2 years.  The olny reason Bitdefender said anything is because I asked a simple question.  You know so much but you do not know how to treat customers.  Hope you have a wonderful day and successful business."

David Wright,1,5,"Fantastic product that doesn't impact the performance of my PC, laptop & Surface. Amazing support from the Customer Support team to resolve an issue I had with one of my installations - all good now :). Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for the complete antivirus package! Thanks Bitdefender!"
Les Rentell,1,1,I ran a scan using Bitdefender and a trojan was identified. Bitdefender was unable to disable it so it gave me the option to exclude it. I assumed this meant it would be quarantined but later found out it meant exclude the affected file from future scans giving the false impression of safety. When I excluded the file I got the message that my computer was safe even though the trojan hadn't been dealt with. I had to manually send the file to trash to get rid of it. I don't use Bitdefender anymore and I cancelled my subscription auto renewal.
Peter,3,1,Bitdefender is rubbish it locks up the computer randomly and adds at least 45 seconds to the boot up time. Their customer services respond with stock replies which usually have no relation to your enquiries or problems. I recommend you do buy this or you bin it if it gives problems as they will do nothing to help you solve them
Szymon Michalak,1,5,This is the best program w=from all that I have used in my life and I have tried plenty of them. It's very light for computer to handle with it doing all stuff in the background.I t was never disappointing for me. I can feel safe and for that I'm grateful.
Marko Atrax Jovanović,1,5,"One of the best customer support I've ever dealt with. They did anything I requested, silly or not."
Christina Gant,1,1,"Bitdefender significantly and unacceptably slowed down my laptop by using way too much RAM. Starting up Windows took way longer, and browsing the internet became a chore. Since I uninstalled it and am using ESET again, my laptop works like a charm. Now I can once again enjoy the fact that I have a SSD harddrive."
Marianna Cheklin,1,1,Their antivirus doesnt work. My pc was infected repeatedly and their helpdesk is hopeless and hard to get through to. I stopped using it.
Randy Rupert,1,3,"update: again, still pleased with Bitdefender on Windows 10 laptop and on a Windows 7 laptop. Nice tools and well integrated.I've had a performance problem on a Samsung Galaxy tablet. I removed Bitdefender and installed AVG and Kaspersky and both ran for a day with no issues. I then re-installed Bitdefender and it has run now for 2 days with no issue.On Windows, 4-5 stars; on Android, 2 stars for an average of 3 stars.I'm not pleased with the solution nor was support that helpful. Not sure anything solved but it's working now.okay on Windows 10 laptopOn Samsung Galaxy tablet this software is a nightmare - the tablet crashes, freezes and periodically slows because of Bitdefender. Had to remove it just to be able to use tablet."
James Gilmour,1,5,"One of the best Anti-virus applications available, take the latest Ransomware attack on the NHS recently, Bitdefender kindly notified me that my devices were already protected against such a treat from day 1.It's less resource hungry than the likes of Norton and step up from AVG and provides a boost in features to protect even the less technical individuals in my family."

Ron Chaim Redner,1,5,"I had an issue with my Windows 7 Aero theme graying out after installing Bitdefender Total Security 90 day Trial. Laura, the customer support rep was caring and gave precise directions on fixing the issue. I really appreciated that. No issues in recommending this company to anyone that is not sure. They left a good impression on me and I take that as a sign that this is the norm, as they most likely strive to be excellent in all their dealings. Reliable company and great service! Thanks, Laura."
Will,2,4,"I was worried by security. My laptop is 8 years old but still working well. I've paid for security before and been let down. Of course the first thought is cost. Tried freebees and found that you get inundated with adverts. so, thought it can't hurt (as long as you are careful . . DON'T CLICK ON ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT SURE OF). So , carefully, tried Bitdefender Free version and, so far, Brilliant. . . No confusing gobbledegook. Just sits in the back ground and does it's stuff. Click on the desktop item and it tells you what it has done. Simple. No I do not work for them and I have surfed some dodgy sites and had no problems. Again, security is ultimately down to you. So far best free security on the market . . So far"
Damir Spanic,1,1,"I payed for Bitdefender. However the product blocked many features of my PC rendered it unusable for work. I had to Google how to uninstall the product as simply remove program would not work. I had to pay for Avast which so far did not cause any inconvenience. (I dont work for Avast, I just wanted something to replace Kaspersky which was troublesome)"

Customer,4,5,"I am a bit of a sad tech, I check out online reviews from companies who are experts in the item I am looking at and when I purchase the item I check, check and then check it again. I am so happy with bitdefender I have even given to my family a licence key each as part of their Christmas presents. Absolutely the easiest recommendation I can can give for this sort of product. Buy it and stop worrying."
Costa Rockas,1,5,"Very good protection! Fast, easy to use and only gets better in leaps and bounds! been using this for many years. I have tried others, but none compare to the way in which Bitdefender works."
EricWQ,1,2,"My rating is for inadequate experience with the product, but I cannot complain about their service. I ordered the Total Security 2017 subscription, and had no real problem installing it on 3 of our 4 systems. When I did have problems, they were quite prompt, with decent follow-up.However, I am underwhelmed by the product, and now wish I had opted for a trial instead of paying for the full year subscription.First, an online manual is utterly useless when the connection is lost, intermittent, or costly. I asked for, and got, a link to the downloadable manual. It is certainly better than having to rely on the online version, but is quite inadequate at explaining the WHY for settings. For example, I was getting blocked from accessing sites with no indication about why the site was considered unsafe. The explanations in the manual are vague, and the solution to avoid the problem is to add the site to a while list. Problem is, adding it to a white list makes no sense if it really is a dangerous page.I'm not a newbie with computers, so would prefer to have resources that explain what risks have triggered the blockage — and be directed to the specific settings that I can adjust to eliminate or adjust the behavior. Secondly, while the support procedure is quite responsive, I'm very leery about what was included in the 7.1MB file collected by their support tool. It evidently included details about all of my installed programs, but they misidentified a scanner driver as a potentially-interfering antivirus scanning tool (and recommended I uninstall it). Thirdly, there is WAY too much traffic from the tool. It seems to be updating every 2 hours, typically with 12-22 files each time. On our relatively slow connection, this causes noticeable lags at times, and I suspect will add to our cellular data charges on the portable devices that have it installed.Finally, it blocks activity that I know is perfectly safe with no warning at all — and the only way to know is by checking the notifications in the panel. Specifically, an update request on my weather station app was blocked with no notice. When I went to the developer's secure encrypted site, Bitdefender blocked it. Only by then checking the Bitdefender panel was it clear that the weather app had been erroneously flagged as an infected web resource.That was the final straw for me. I'd installed Bitdefender because of the recent ransomware scare, but this product adds far more overhead and babysitting than I'm willing to cope with. Ironically, when I went to the Bitdefender Uninstall tool page, my Firefox browser put up a warning message flagging it as being a potentially unsafe website."
carol chow,1,5,"To install Bitdefender to a computer with OS Windows 10 is very straight forward.  It only asked to uninstall Norton remaining files and was done automatically.  My existing antivirus program ESET was still operating and did not interfere with the installation.  I just remove ESET myself later after Bitdefender was successfully installed.My second device is a computer with OS Windows Vista.  BD Antivirus Plus 2017 is not compatible to install, but the 2015 version.  I had a lot of problem to install it.  It requires to remove ALL existing antivirus files, even I have uninstalled ESET program.  I have tried 18 times and all the 17 downloads were remembered and had to be cleaned.  I rebooted my computer many times back and forth in safe and regular mode.  My computer was at risk and could not use email to get the instructions from Bitdefender support team.  I have to get them from another computer and copied the commands to this computer.  I worked on it for 2 days and am very exhausted.  Finally, I can trust the Support Team and successfully installed.  Thanks a lot."
Jonathan,8,5,"User of Bitdefender Total Security which is in my opinion the best, almost the most complete  and effective security software on the market for Windows, Mac & Android.The only thing missing is native system backup, however i would probably not be satisfied with simple backup solutions."
Peter,1,2,BEWARE of Bitdefender.I got caught  badly. Make sure you read the reviews. Better still go some where else.
David Brungo,6,4,"This is a follow up to a complaint I had with Bitdefender:Reference no.: 47282454Payment method: Visa/MasterCardDate/time: 2016-03-06 00:01:48Order General Total: 149.96 USDI am very happy -- and grateful -- to Bitdefender for resolving this issue to my fullest satisfaction, and I regret that I was not able to do business with the company as I had planned after researching cyber security software.Thanks very much for refunding my purchase price!"

Bill,3,2,"I converted from Bullguard to Bitdefender Internet Security 2017 two months ago based on reviews across the internet.As a tool for combating viruses, I found the software to be effective at least as much as a typical end user can be sure!However, for me there was an irresolvable problem. I have 2 graphics cards GeForce  GTX580 which I need to sometimes interconnect with SLI. When I try to do this via the Nivida Panel I am told to close bdagent.exe, which is a Bitdefender process. I am then told this file is protected and I am unable to close. I raised this issue with Bitdefender support and initially received prompt support but their suggestions proved ineffective. After three weeks all feedback dried up and I was left assuming there was no solution! It was at this point I reverted to Bullguard and life is good again.    This will not be problem that effects everyone but if you have two Nividia graphics card and you want to link them using SLI, think again before using Bitdefender."
Roksana,2,2,"the product itself looks great this is why I keep fighting for my subscription instead of cancelling the order BUT if you buy it via AVANGATE the trouble starts: a few days ago I was knowingly mis-sold BItdefender. They advertise 9.99/year subscription and sell (to me at least) a 9.99GBP/month subscription. When confronted, they ignored all the questions and just requested to contact Bitdefender. And Bitdefender didn't respond at all. AVANGATE also turns on AUTO RENEWAL service WITHOUT warning you about it (I double checked the website after I discovered it).So in a nutshell: I order a 9.99GBP yearly sunscription and recieved a 12x9.99 subscription. Which doesn't even exist on their website!"
Andy,7,5,"As long as an AntiVirus is faster than WD it is good!BD has so many features, here and there some spacings of buttons should be fixed, but they don't really matter.If you have the right settings false positives won't be often and you will still have great security.They offer a lot of features and some features I don't even use but other people may feel like they can use them. Ransomware Blocker, Antispam and much more!"
Bob Andrews,2,1,"I was a paid customer of Bitdefender. I contacted their support group and they billed me to help repair my PC. The sales associate bragged that when one calls Bitdefender they all speak English.They were not able to repair my problem as I was passed off from one technician to another which required reading what was attempted to get me up and running. Once, a tech said she was getting off work in a minute so she needed to pass my problem on. It took days before I finally gave up and took my PC to a repair shop. It's now working fine, but since I had to reinstall my files from Carbonite it took a couple of more days.Now they're refusing to give me a refund because I hadn't contacted them in time. Well duhhhh. My computer was being repaired by and ""in the shop"". Here's there response to a refund: As per our refund policy, we can issue a refund within the first 30 days from the date of purchase. After checking your account we have noticed that you exceeded that period of time and we are unable to process a refund; however, you have all of our attention if you wish to give our product another chance.We regret any inconvenience this situation might have caused and we will gladly try to investigate what is happening on your computer and how Bitdefender can be set up in order to respond to your needs. Of course, an extension will be applied on your subscription to compensate the time spent dealing with this situation."
Frank Strehlow,4,4,Thank you Alexandru Ivanescu from Bitdefender. Finally the subscription issue with my Bitdefender product got resolved and I also received an free  year of free subscription on top.
Ken Etcher,2,5,"Bitdefender has been my choice for several years simp;t because nothing does it better. It is simple to use, has so many helpful extensions/add -ons, such as Wallet and Auto-Pilot.  Now as for telephone support BitDefender Support is the VERY BEST I have ever experienced, not just the best software support but the best support whether retail buying , Government enquiries/ or anything else I have ever needed help with.  Bitdefender gets the highest rating I can possibly give.  If you want the best available get what I have used for many years, BitDefender Total Security, it really is the BEST!!!

Silky Johnson,1,1,"I also fell victim to the ""auto- renew"" rubbish this assbutt company conducts. Just google ""bitdenfender auto renew s***,"" and you'll see a plethora of accounts by users who have been thieved and treated poorly by this company. I was not aware that there was an 'auto- renew' feature (which you have to actively disable).  So when I saw that my credit card had been charged (un- authorised and unknowingly) for a subscription renewal (approx $90 USD), I immediately opened a paypal disptute. Paypal informed me that they could not do anything in this situation to help me and urged me to contact bitdefender directly. The scum who work in customer service were condescending, rude, unprofessional and passive aggressive from beginning to end. When I explained my situation and asked for a refund I was verbatim told ""Well if you had contacted us directly we could have easily given you a refund. But since you went straight to paypal we can't help you (*BLOWS RASPBERRIES*).""  Shortly after, they deactivated my product so I could not use it. So in short, I was unknowingly charged for a subscription renewal, I opened a dispute with paypal and told they couldn't help me, so then I contacted bitdefender and they refused to give me a refund/ threw a tantrum and stole my product from me. Essentially, they took my money AND the product from me. If this isn't theft (allegedly), I don't know what is. What's shocking is just how rude, passive aggressive and condescending the service representatives were. Is your business run by low lives or pre-pubescent teenagers with attitude problems? Jesus christ. Get your s*** together bitdefender. I have warned all my friends and everyone in my vicinity about the unethical and heinous actions of this company. Many of my friends and family have since unsubscribed and boycotted this product. I will continue to warn everyone I know about this company. To the rude and puerile as*h**** that work in customer support--  your company will get what it deserves! Hide yo kids! Hide yo laptops!"

I can buy virtually anything online with PayPal and login with my Facebook account..Well goodbye Bitdefender, I'll choose another AV product that will let me purchase with my verified PayPal address.No wonder AV software houses are clutching at straws to keep customers, total feck up if you ask me.."

Derek Rickards,9,5,Bitdefender is a first class product that I have used in one form or another for years. I have high regard for the free version and the paid for versions. I personally use Internet Security on my desktop and have used Bitdefender on  my mobile phones. Over the years I have used most of the well known brands of antivirus/security products but keep coming back to Bitdefender. I take my privacy and security seriously and thus happily recommend  this product.
John Limrick,1,5,Customer service engineer was very knowledgeable and helpful.Solved my issues in a few minutes. Highly recommended.

Michael,8,3,"Bitdefender as a antivirus software is great, it keeps you safe and protected, while barely using any computer power. Unfortunately I encounted problems with Bitdefender making my computer crash, but mistakes happens and I choose to contact the support. The support is trying to help, but it's so slow about answering, like one supporter takes 10 people at a time. Apart from that half the messages looks like comming from a predefined bot. This makes the support very poorly, and mostly not helpful at all.I really wanna recommend Bitdefender as a product, but your support don't match it in any ways, which is really unfortunate due to the quality of the product."

John Mout,1,1,"Double charged for annual subscription!It is strange to read another customer complaining about the same issue a little bit further down. Last year 2016, I bought a license around end of March. On January this year 2017 there was a sales period with good discount so I upgraded and purchased another year. However when April came I was charged again when last years purchase expired. As such I had two years subscription in my account. After complaining to them they removed the extra year from my account but did NOT refund me. This is essentially stealing.Whenever I call their support they say that they will contact me back in 24 hours but none does. Horrible, horrible service!STAY AWAY from them or make sure you cancel your subscription immediately after purchase.EDIT: It gets even more ridiculous. After many more emails, they refunded the one extra year that they charged me and completely wiped my subscription. Case ID 2017042515060003"
Star Gazing,2,5,"Very good customer service. Excellent product for a very good price, keeping various devices secure under one subscription. Easy to install and does not overload the system. Definately to recommend."
Jan B,5,4,The GUI should be redefined
Henri,1,1,"Long story short;Last year, when my then 2015 license was about to expire, i received a pop-up flier from my BD desktop tray indicating that my subscription was about to expire and that i should take advantage of the all new 2016 version at a discounted rate. I thought it to be a good deal and decided to confirm this upgrade. well, unbeknownst to me, not only did they upgrade me to the new version but (their words) because i was signed up for auto renewal (Not something i ever remember choosing), i was then charged a full list price to have an additional year subscription to BD TS 2015... WHAT?!!!So last year i had 2 subscriptions simultaneously and had no idea as i was only using the newest version.Now i am being told that they cannot return this money because it is outside of their 30 day return policy??!!I am completely astounded by the fact that no one at their customer care line can understand that it was THEIR product that suggested i upgrade and it should be THEIR product that realizes that i upgraded and should have no more need for an outdated version renewal!Now the only response i get from them is that it is outside of their 30 day return policy and theres nothing they can do.. What a bunch of crap.BEWARE OF THIS SCAM! Make sure you cancel any auto renewals as they will gladly charge you for a service you no longer need, use or want. all while disguising it as an ""UPGRADE"" to you current version!"
Elaine,4,1,"Secure to the point of absurdity!I paid to have BitDefender installed on my PC as it is nearly impossible to install on your own. Now, my PC is effectively a very expensive word processor. I cannot download any program or access the internet. I cannot install anything. So my PC sits gathering dust. Never again!"
Rich,7,2,"I had used McAfee for years and was totally happy with that. However my McAfee updater seemed to have become corrupted and was not updating. Rather than get into the maze that is trying to contact customer services, I decided after a number of years it was time to take another look at what AntiVirus products were out there, and if McAfee came out on top I would re-install it, but if there were others that got better ratings now it might be time for a change. While McAfee’s ratings and reviews were generally good, it appeared that Kaspersky and Bitdefender came out on top from a technical perspective on PC Worlds reviews. I was aware that Kaspersky were going to be the bigger of the two, which meant there was a bit of a risk going with a smaller bespoke anti virus company, but on the other hand the smaller ones are sometimes more lithe and focused. Bitdefender were doing what appeared to be a half price offer, so I went for it. However from the day of installing it I have not liked it. The interface is just a small black box that comes up when you click on it. It is very hard to navigate it and is extremely non-user friendly. For example it calls things you want to use like the ransomware protection ‘modules’. It simply sits there encouraging you to go onto Autopilot. Now sure, I am sure it is blocking viruses and attacks and so on, but it is just so non user friendly it is hard to ‘use’ it. I was particularly keen on the ransomware protection, but on loading Bitdefender it was anyone’s guess where this was, how to set it up, how to use it, and whether this was actually enabled or not, and indeed if not, how to enable it. I contacted customer services who didn’t reply for ages. In the interim I logged on as an administrator, and found that seemingly that was necessary to enable half of the features , including the ransomware feature (when customer services finally came back to me days later they confirmed this). There is meant to be some sort of website ratings or review programme as part of it as well, which works on your web browser, similar to McAfee webadvisor or the equivalent that AVG do, but it didn’t seem to be enabled either. I messed around with the interface for a while and appeared to have got this working. Little safe or non safe icons were now coming up now on a google web search next to the websites. However on logging back on the following day this just wasn’t working anymore. While it is understandable for a business, in that it doesn’t want all employees being able to configure the company’s antivirus, for a home user on your own PC, your antivuirus programme should actually be encouraging you not to log on as an administrator, but as a user, as if you simply use your computer as an administrator all the time this is a security risk itself. Having logged on as an administrator to enable everything, then having logged back on as a user, I really am not clear whether half the features are actually working or not. The interface is so poorly laid out, generally confusing, and contains no explanation as to what any of the randomly named features do, assuming you can find them in the first place. You get a security report once a week, telling you it has blocked all sorts of threats, but it’s a bit of a waste of time, as you are unable to click on anything to get any more details as to what happened. A few weeks into using it I suddenly got an error message in logging onto windows, saying that Windows couldn’t log on my user account, as it couldn’t connect to the system event notification service. It would let me log on as an administrator though. I did this and had a look at the event log, and the first error warning I saw was related to some sort of app hang to do with Bitdefender. At the time I didn’t assume that Bitdefender itself was the problem (but now I think it is). This problem persists, and I have googled around on a few forums for the same error, and guess what comes up? A few other Bitdefender users mentioning the same problem. In one forum I read Bitdefender replied to the user offering some sort work around fix to their machine including a change to some of their registry code, to try and sort this out. The user replied by saying something like ‘why should I have to go these lengths just to use your antivirus programme, and instead why wouldn’t I just uninstall your piece of c***’. I tend to agree. Having now just logged on as an administrator again to see what the status of the various ‘modules’ are in my Bitdefender, I cannot even find where the ransomware feature is anymore, after 5 mins of hunting around the interface. I can’t be bothered to delve into the advanced user manual just to look for this. I am still having problems just logging onto windows generally, and main culprit in the event log remains Bitdefender. I am getting a new PC in a couple of weeks and I am not going to re-install Bitdefender on it, but will either go back to McAfee or go with Kaspersky. Rather than wait the week or so it could take for Bitdefender to try and look into this new logging onto windows problem, I decided to simply make sure my Bitdefender product wasn’t on auto-renewal and let it expire next year, as I got in the cheap anyway. Once again, there appears to be nowhere at all on the interface to find this info out. So I logged onto their website and entered my username and password. Under my account on the website you still cannot find this information out. I decided to contact customer services. On clicking on that link on their website it says something like ‘we are constantly working to improve the service, please try later’. In other words contact us / customer service is down and not working. In summary, while I am sure this blocks threats as well as anything else out there (but to be honest if it didn’t you woudnt consider buying it in the first place would you!), it is so non-user friendly and confusing, the interface is so muddled, it is totally unclear whether half the features are working or not, and how to use them and set them up and what they do, and when you enable them they later seem to be unenabled again, and now, in my case it is actually stopping me logging onto windows with a user account, that I really wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Bitdefender disappear or get eaten up by one of the bigger companies going forward. I am not struggling with this antivirus programme any longer, and as soon as my new PC arrives I will not be using Bitdefender any longer."
Sue Pockett,2,2,"I paid for a year's renewal.  They acknowledged this.  But for a long time I was unable to activate this renewal, because all their instructions told me to do things that were impossible.  Turns out this was because their instructions (a) don't apply to Macs (even though the product I purchased is FOR a Mac) and also (b) don't work under Firefox, only Safari.  Presumably this also means the product as a whole doesn't work in Firefox.  I was unable to download the extensions that would supposedly have removed the little red cross under ""Firefox protected"".  Ticket number 2017042822200001Also 2017043021230003My response to the second of these tickets was:""The instructions from that article didn't work -- no green dot when restarted Firefox.  Clicking Fix Now in the Bitdefender panel that pops up on clicking the App in Finder, which still had a little red cross beside Firefox, didn't work.  Then the whole computer locked up completely and even Force Quit didn't work.Finally I turned the whole computer off and on again. Then there was a little GREEN cross beside Firefox.  But when I tried to go to My Account, all I got was a blank screen.Presumably Firefox is now protected (although I still don't see the advertised green dot beside its URL box).  But this whole process has been frustrating in the extreme.  Maybe after a year I will have forgotten all this and might buy it again, but at the moment -- never again!""For the benefit of other punters I repeat -- unless you're happy to get yourself into the above sort of mess -- and then get yourself out of it again -- don't buy Bitdefender."

Ralph Jansen,1,1,"I used the program a couple of years then with the last year they added an element that continually asks you to log into the website, and if you don't it will continue to harrass you, and it has high enough privilege to kick you out of programs.  I tried to look up how to stop it from doing this, but apparently it is not possible without logging in, which I do not want to do."

Richmond Basallo,1,3,"I'll be sharing my experience with Bitdefender ~ Feel free to read. I've read different Anti Virus reviews and saw Bitdefender on top of the list so I've decided to do a free trial first on Bitdefender Antivurs 2017 before subscribing on their plan. Based on my free trial, I can say that I've had a positive and a negative experience. Positive experiences are: 1) Bitdefender does its work properly like detecting/deleting potential viruses without scanning the program and allows you to view what are these programs/files detected, and 2) gives you options if you'd like to make the program on 'autopilot' or not as well as allowing you to customize different kinds of scan. However, negative experiences are: 1) Bitdefender eats your computer's memory/ram/disk that makes your computer really slow and sometimes can cause your computer to hang (forces you to do a system shut down/restart). Unfortunately, believe it or not it did happen on my computer, 2) As I was doing a full scan, I wasn't able to finish it since it 'automatically logged out' my Bitdefender account at around 87% (almost 5 hours of scanning since I have lots of files) and I don't have any clue how did that happen.. So, I have to log in again and repeat everything from the top (which I didn't repeat anymore), and lastly, 3) For me, it really annoys me that it automatically detects and deletes without my permission my so-called 'trusted app' not unless I put them on the 'trusted app list'.. Imagine placing almost all your so-called 'trusted program' into that list just because your AV thinks it has 'potential/harmful virus'.Suggestion: For people who would want to purchase Bitdefender, I'd prefer you to download their free trial first and see it yourself. Hopefully these experiences won't also happen to you. Anyway, it wasn't a really bad experience after all but in my case I just have to uninstall it to avoid future-force-system-shutdown/restart. Thanks for reading!"

Suzi Spinato,1,5,actually at the beginning i did not like bitdefender i found it a product that was difficult to handle on the computer sluggish... slowed down the computer and just overall annoying .....then i realized my bitdefender had expired oewch and i needed to do something quickly ..i went back through my emails and saw they sent me an email offering a special price but every time i went to checkout to pay the price was 4 times the amount advertised..so i got in contact with their support team and actually communicated live real time with 2 of the team support members...quite impressed with this... now after a bit of problem solving and disagreeing we did reach a final resolution which was to what i wanted..it did go up further on the chain of command ...but you know what i was really impressed and was very happy with the outcome i got the renewal that i wanted for 5 machines at the price that they had emailed which ultimately was the price that i wanted to pay in the first place.. am very happy with product now and how it performs too..they must have tweaked the product since my last renewal....oh i even went so far as to compare ...review... and had intentions to go back to kaspersky but by the reviews bitdefender seemed the more advanced product...so bitdefender won in price backup service and performance

Wayne,1,3,I had renewed my subscription in nov during a Black Friday special which updated my renewal time now for another 1 year plus my remaining time under the current contract. Recently my computer identified with bit def that I now had a 30 trial offer. What happened to my full 1 year I renewed . On top of that the other computer that was on the program got the same results . Unfortunately this is the second time bit def has done this in my years with them and has me now questioning whether I need this hassle every time. Should I be looking at a more user friendly protector as this last one was quite time consuming in getting it resolved and also a worry to boot. There is much more to add but this is a quick summary.

Here's why:I'm not super computer literate so cleaning up and organizing disk space, running scans - managing the inner workings of my computer in general is not something I could do without the easy to use tools afforded to me through Bitdefender. One purchase (which is so easy to renew and install) covers my laptop, tablet, and smart phone. Their ""Wallet"" and ""Safe Banking""  functions enable me to feel very protected while on-line shopping and on-line banking. I've contacted their Customer Service through their chat line a couple of times. Questions are grasped quickly and response is fast and easy to understand. This is the best protection package I've ever experienced - that's why I will continue to trust Bitdefender."

Pete,10,1,"Advertises 24/7 support, but does not even bother to answer. I have two serious issues that I have reported to them since recently installing Bitdefender Total Security, the first being that it shuts down my router, which I posted six days ago, and the second is that it turns off WIFI if two people try to use laptops at the same time. To date I have had neither acknowledgement nor a response telling me how to fix these issues. I had Norton prior to switching to Bitdefender and Norton's support was second to none. I will now have to chase a refund and reinstall Norton, but I have read terrible reports about Bitdefender and their sales agent Avangate being reluctant to provide refunds, with some reports calling Avangate thieves, but if they don't fix these problems in the next day or so, I will fight it out with them and revert to Norton.My order ID is 58470270. and I have in the last few minutes, after complaining received a New Open ticket: 2017040507390003. It appears that complaining via Trustpilot is a much simpler way of getting attention than your hopelessly slow Tech support  who have been given zip files and log system reports which they apparently ignore. As for refunds, I will apply if you can't fix the problems, but I have read extremely bad reports about Avangate and refunds, with some people calling them 'outright thieves'."
Mads Lorenzen,4,1,"Downloaded and bought the Total Security 2017 - right after installing it my WIFI would not work, but I KNEW it was working because I was using it on my mobile phone. I then contacted Bitdefender via the support box in the program and through mail and after not getting a reply I contacted the Twitter department. After maybe 5 days I got a reply from their e-mail account, but in the meanwhile the Twitter support suggested me to configure my firewall settings (btw. they reply fast and are great). As i NEED my wifi I had to un-install bitdefender and therefore having a totally unsecure PC, just to use the wifi............ Therefore, I had to try their suggestions a few days later. Configuring the firewall did not work, and i then contacted twitter and the online chat function via the website.Quick replies in the chat function and they suggested a few things. I spent 20 minutes following their suggestions. They asked me to go in toolbox and ""repair"" Bitdefender - it did not work and I said to them that it is a crazy start to a product you have bought that you need to go in an repair it yourself.Then they asked me to e-mail them a ""Generate Log"" and ""connectivity log"" and they would get back to me as quickly as possible. This was the 29 of march and as of now, 4 april, I still havn't got a reply from them.(Chat 2017032920510001)This is completely unacceptabel that I order an anti virus program and then I cant even use my computer properly because it blocks my wifi, and they cant even fix it.... I can even understand on the internet that this is a common problem. I have now asked for a FULL REFUND via the online chat (Chat 2017040417450002). They forwarded the ticket to the sales department and they will e-mail me. So I wonder when or ever i will get a e-mail from them"
Mairi NicIllemhoire,8,5,"Absolutely exemplary product. I've worked in IT for 2 decades, and you name it, I've worked with it (and several solutions, I'd have to say I had to work against). The only other AV that even comes close is Nod32, and even that doesn't tick all of my boxes.Bitdefender wins hands-down against: Norton, MacAfee, Sophos, Panda, Avast, Avira & AVG. TrendMicro weren't bad, but the footprint and overhead just can't compare to Bitdefender. I always install Bitdefender on any PCs I build for people (I'm a MS OEM System Builder), and have never had any complaints. Fantastic product - live long and prosper!"
Peter Meier,2,2,"I read in a computer magazine that Bitdefender should be one of the best antivirus software on the marked, so I decide to buy it and installed on 2 PC’s, one with Windows 10 and one with Windows 7.After installing both PC’s worked so slowly, I could not work anymore, all what I did needed many seconds to open and some application I could not open anymore, I only saw the hourglass.I wrote an email to the support but they never answered. So I decide to uninstall Bitdefender and see, all work now perfect. It’s a pity for the money I spend.Edit: Now 3 weeks later I got follow Email from Bitdefender:Thank you for your patience.We hope this email finds you well.

Few months back I get a flash screen appear on one system tell me I can upgrade to the 2017 release for free, so I hit and it works for a while, removes the old 2015 version of AV, tries to load 2017, fails several times, finally I get it loaded but now I must get an activation key to load, finally find the one for that system and all is well. Or so I thought. A month later another system pops up the same free upgrade link...  no way am I going thru that again. I contact support tell them my story and asked if install problem was resolved. I receive instructions  how to do the upgrade another way, guess what, the area they had me go to did not have the links they said to use. Duh.  So I find something interesting when I sign on to my BitDefender account, if I am on a machine with AV 2017 it shows I have only one device, if I to the exact same BD account from a machine with AV 2015 it says I have 3 devices. WTH I think. Same account, same password, but 2 different results. So after going back and forth with BD about this, still did not get a straight answer about the upgrade situation, I am told they will combine my 2 ""licenses"" into 1 account but take off 20 days from the 220 some days I have remaining on the license because of the ""price difference"" in the products.  WHAT?  BD sends out an upgrade link which doesn't work properly, when I sign on to their system with one user/password I get different results basedon which AV I am running, and to get this mess corrected they expect me to ok reducing the length of coverage.  Seems something is wrong with this.  My last contact with them was, NO WAY, I will not upgrade and when the license runs out I will move on to another product.  It is a shame but things change......2017031216060003"
Michelle Brooks,1,1,"Bitdefender will abuse their customers trust when they have received your credit card details.  I bought their product in 2015 and before the subscription was finished I purchased the Norton product instead because I felt Norton provide a better quality of product.  In 2016 without my permission, Bitdefender automatically renewed my subscription.  I received a refund after a long period of time and was assured that they would not automatically renew again.  Fast forward to today in 2017 and Bitdefender have automatically renewed my subscription again, I have once again had my credit card charged by Bitdefender, without my permission and for a product that  I do not want.  Do not give these people your credit card details, they are running a scam by doing this, I have used many different pc security software suites over the years and no other company has done this!Also, if you read through these reviews, you will see that Bitdefender are fully aware of the issue with auto renewal, they come on here and pay lip service to unsatisfied customers about how sorry they are that this has happened and yet they continue to charge people without permission for a product they do not want.  I intend to dedicate my day to writing reviews on this company, to alert unwitting customers about what this company is doing."
Rachael,3,1,"My subscription ended in 2012, and I have been billed by a third party since that time. I called up approximately 24 months ago when I noted it was happening and was told the payments would be cancelled. 4 days ago, I noticed payments were still occurring. I went to my bank to halt payments, and was told by my bank that payments had occurred since my subscription ended. I have been in contact with the company a number of times in the past couple of days, and they will  not refund me my money because their refund policy is 30 days. At no time I was told that I would need to call different people to have payments stopped. SCAM ARTISTS! They have now scammed $300 from me and I am only entitled to one of those payments back because it falls in the 30 day refund policy!!!!!UPDATE- After reviewing bitdefender on a few sites, they PROMISED me in WRITING to refund all money taken without authorisation. they have so far refunded three deductions but have now said they are unable to refund the last two!!!!"
Clarence,9,2,"Bitdefender Total Security:All I want from an internet security package is ease of use, minimal computer slow down and up to date security.  I bought Bitdefender when my subscription with a previous supplier ended because of the reviews and its reasonable price.  I wish I'd stuck with my old system.Since the latest update I can't print as Bitdefender is blocking the printer (a known issue apparently) and the only workaround is to switch the firewall off which is not very reassuring.My laptop has also slowed down noticeably.On the positive side, I do like the Parental Advisor.Maybe once they sort the network blocking problem I'll reconsider the rating but for now I wouldn't recommend.EDIT: Have reduced rating to 2 stars.  I have uninstalled, repaired and rebooted numerous times as per instructions from Support.  Now I have new problems.  As someone who relies on their laptop as a business tool, this is costing me £££s in time wasted trying to sort this out.  I'm about to uninstall and go with another supplier."
Dennis Geary,1,2,"I started a chat on December 27th, regarding issues that started with the conversion to Bitdefender 2017. The issues then, and those created in the trial and error methodology used to address my problems remain unresolved today.  There is never a real time connection with any agent.  The communication is always by email. Responses take days and even more than a week in one instance to recieve. The short version is that the remaining issue with 2017, it will not recognize the wireless adapters in my machines, I have to turn my firewall off to print or scan. Kaspersky is looking really good to return to.Chat 2017011602290001.As an update, I have tried and tried on my own to reload 2017. One reload actually recognized the Adapter, but the mandatory update then deleted the adapter. I can duplicate the reload and get the adapter, but the update always deletes the adapter."
Anne Hickley,4,3,"I have used Bitdefender for a couple of years - I experienced the same auto-enrol problem that other people have mentioned last year, but OK this year. Although the product largely runs very smoothly on the three PCs in our office, since installing the updated version this year we have had a problem with the firewall and an inability to access an FTP site. I first wrote to support in 5th January 2017. It is now 15th March. I'm still waiting for a solution. I have had about four or five responses with suggestions on how to proceed in that time, usually after I have nudged them and pointed out I've been waiting two weeks or whatever. So far none of the suggestions have helped and I think next year I will have to find another product to use as an antivirus. It's a shame because this problem only started with this year's update and everything else works well."
Josiah Ketcham,2,1,"I bought a 2 year subscription for total security and couldn't get it to install, after being online with customer service 4 times and then just telling me to reboot and try again I purchased the remote installation so they could figure it out, remote installation software wouldn't install either! I finally resolved my initial installation on my own no help to customer service now I want a refund for the remote installation that I never got to use and they're refusing to refund the money! They offered me a free year of the software or PC Optimization session which I want neither since when my 2 year subscription is up in leaving them and I build and optimize my own machines. It's been 7 days and 6 E-mails back and forth to customer service and today they E-mailed me (7 days after the initial request) saying that they're checking in and working on the solution to my problem, the solution is simple! Refund my money and that's it, problem solved. I'm giving them 4 more days to refund my account for the remote installation that I never installed or I be demanding a refund for the rest of the software and taking my business elsewhere. Customer service is a very important part of a good company and these guys couldn't help me with an installation issue that ended up being the answer to a question that I asked 2 times over the live chat but the question was ignored both times. Get your customer service done more training and try again please. I hope I don't run into any issues with the software if I keep it because of I do I'm on my own to figure it out."
shawn,1,1,This customer service is a joke. I contacted then over the phone 5 times and live chatted with a representative 3 times trying to resolve my issue and all they could say was i had to wait on an email with the resolution to my issue. then they send me and email saying they havent heard back from me in a while and they needed addition information. Im so disappointed with this experience. complete waste of time and money.
Joe Bloe,1,1,"Auto-renewal is very difficult to end. You can't even do it from their website, you have to go by another third party site. I really don't think it's respectful to their customers. Auto-renewal can be a good feature, but not if it's imposed. That's called a scam. I people seem to have a lot of difficulty getting their money back, because the billing is done by this third party, so bitdefender can confidently say they have nothing to do with it, which is really shady.Go anywhere else but bitdefender. You must trust your anti-virus company, if you don't, you should change."
Torben Nonbo,3,1,"Got an email from bitdefender telling me my account is set for auto-renewal:Your Bitdefender Total Security 2016 expires on 2017-03-26. Your account is set for auto-renewal, so you enjoy continous protection. Unless you choose to opt out, your Bitdefender subscription will extend automatically for another year. Problem is there is no way you can change that. Also there is nowhere that you can see it. So i contacted live chat support, and here they confirmed that : No, it is not displayed under any bitdefender website.Only the commercial department manages it.and all he could do was to send a request to the commercial department, and then they would contact me. Can't wait to see if that will ever happen, as i have read that this have happened many times before.At first i just wanted to change my subscription from total security to multi device security, and i have been using bitdefender for more than 3 years, but after the chat i won't use bitdefender again, allthough the program itself is really god.---Ticket 2017031111480001I have recieved an email from bitdefender now offering me a discount, but it said nothing about that I could change autorenewal.-I will update later"
Brett Jones,2,1,"The anti-virus product itself is pretty good.However, their billing, licensing and support services are the worst I have ever dealt with!!I had 2 license keys both of which I paid for separately.  I cancelled one license key as I no longer needed two license keys.  The license was cancelled except each year on the anniversary of the original product purchase the cancelled license key would auto renew itself and charge my credit card.By that stage I could no longer access the cancelled license key account to disable the auto renew option.  I explained this to Bit Defender in 2015 and they refunded the money and said the license key was cancelled for good and the auto renew option was disabled.  Then 1 year later the exact same thing happened and they charged me for the cancelled license key account that I had cancelled almost 2 years ago.  I kept writing to their support department and they continued to refuse a refund for 5 emails.Finally after asking for the complaint to be escalated (for the third time) Bit Defender finally agreed to refund the money for the license key that I cancelled 2 years ago.  But then when they provided the refund for the cancelled license key, they then deactivated my other active license key which I was still using and which I had paid for separately.I have never had a worst consumer experience.Ticket number:  2016121209490002"

Jesse Balal,1,4,A perfect and trustworthy Antivirus that will cover all your needs.
shawn stone,1,4,"After reading the glowing software reviews, I was pretty pumped about the antivirus software and bought it sight unseen from the website. I then installed it and it runs in the background wonderfully. On the initial scan of my mac, it actually found some PC viruses in some source I had downloaded. Software seems to be running fine and I think it's doing something.Unfortunately, it turns out I had bought the wrong license (the PC version not the mac). So I texted with a customer support person to see if I could get the license transferred - who forwarded the communication to some other 'support' people. A week later I heard back from 'Petar' who said that it wouldn't be a problem to transfer the license if I wanted it done (which was the whole point of my contacting them). I emailed back that I did - and didn't hear anything back. A week later I sent another email saying 'hello' and haven't heard anything back. And the license hasn't been transferred. I really don't understand the silence and am a little fearful that the software isn't legitimate given the horrid response times. I even opened up another ticket through the web interface hoping that someone would respond. All to say - proceed with caution .. especially as amazingly there are all these '5 star' reviews saying how wonderful the customer support is.Update 1:Thank you for responding. I assume editing this review is the only way I can get my support ticket numbers to you since you didn't leave an email or phone number. The first ticket was 2017021114390002 and my repeat ticket that I placed was 2017021714550005. I'll definitely update this review if you're able to provide support. Of note some of the reviews here mention calling into some number. Is there a number I can call? I can't find one on your web page.Update 2:As stated in their reply below, I was contacted privately by bitdefender support within 24hrs of the last update (we are definitely corresponding across multiple time zones) and they were able to quickly modify the subscription as I hoped. They expressed dismay at the bad customer service (I appreciated the genuineness of it) and stated they would be working to figure out what the missteps were. I've changed the review from 3 to 4 stars as my needs have been met- albeit by having to post a review on a public forum.Of note, their private reply to me also explained where the phone number is hidden. I was looking for a phone number under the support section of 'bitdefender central' (where you login to manage your subscriptions) and the only thing that I found there was an icon which allowed me to text support (which is what I did the first time). They pointed out that if I had gone to Home->HomeUserSupport and then clicked on the little iphone icon which is all the way to the right under ""Directly Contact Our Support Team"", I would have been much more successful (I checked and truly they do have phone numbers all over the world). I legitimately feel embarrassed at my incompetence as I think I had actually been on that page when I sent in a support request the second time; but my general expectation of the company by the time I was looking for a number was low, so I probably didn't try clicking all the icons hard enough. I appreciate bitdefender for providing a quick response to my complaints in this forum and am hopeful their software will provide the antivirus support I need."
George Hanushick,1,5,"Rarely, if at all, I have received such a fast and good AND dedicated service as with Bitdefender. In future, I will trust Bitdefender products reliably, especially since they have proven to be the best product in the test of a well-known magazine.Selten - wenn überhaupt jemals - habe ich einen so schnellen und guten UND engagierten Service erhalten wie bei Bitdefender. In Zukunft werde ich Bitdefender-Produkten verläßlich den Vorzug geben, zumal sie sich im Test einer bekannten Zeitschrift als das beste Produkt erwiesen haben."
Barry Whetstine,1,5,"After using many different AV products I have to say Bitdefender seems to be the least invasive and least resource hungry AV product I have used plus it does it's job. Also, very pleased with quick, knowledgeable, and easy response when contacting tech support."
Pritam Mandal,3,5,In this fast era we all want to solve our problems as fast as possible. Bitdefender is the answer. I was a Kaspersky fan but now a follower of Bitdefender. Great choice I  promise you won't regret.
Riyan Setyo W,1,4,Very Nice UI and Performance
Michael siamthai,1,5,The help via chat  ( Thanks Mr.Cristian Gollino and Cosmin Ploscaru). Than the help via phone was amazing. Afterwards I got an email to show me step by step how to do. Thanks guys from  Bitdefender Thailand Support Center Team
Rob Weigelt,1,5,"Average computer users need to feel confident that if they are experiencing a problem using a program, the parent company will listen, evaluate and respond to the consumer with a simple, easy to use solution.That was my experience with Bitdefender. And by the way, the problem was not with my Bitdefender program, it was with other programs I had installed on my computer. The Bitdefender customer service rep provided me with a step-by-step solution (with easy to follow directions) that allowed me to uninstall the programs which interfered with the operation of Bitdefender.  When you lead by example, you show someone how to solve a problem.  That is the Bitdefender way!"
Captain J Campbell,1,1,"Bitdefender's product was great but beware of the renewal.  They charged my bank account two days before subscription expired. When I tried to get a refund, (still before expiration) they sent email stating they would respond shortly.... that was two months ago !!! They have replied to any of my emails since... NOTHING from customer service at All. *BEWARE*"
D. Burley,2,5,Had a problem with subscriptions on 2 PC's. I telephoned Customer Service and was connected immediately. Customer Service managed to combine onto 1 multi-device subscription with a free upgrade to Bitdefender Total Security 2017 5 devices. The agent was very helpful and guided me through the process of configuration. Product looks great. Fantastic customer service!
Howard F,1,5,"The Company responded promptly to my trouble ticket and kept me updated with the progress of the resolution. After resolving and distributing the fix in a universal software update, they made a nominal financial commitment to compensate me for my problem and assistance. Without my prompting, they honored their commitment by extending my coverage period.A trustworthy and honorable software vendor!!"
Reginald (Reg) Read,1,5,"When purchasing my first computer 10/12 years ago, I was very much a self taught person.I subscribe to ""Which Computer"" who had tested and reviewed Bitdefender AV, the opinion was that Bitdefender was the best AV for novice  computer users, that description expressed exactly my abilities.Of course I had to obtain professional help to download AV Programme it being beyond my abilities. Happily I have now gained enough experience to be able to attend to downloading without getting myself into difficulties.My decission to use Bitdefender AV has proved to me that I have made the best choice available, in the latest ""Which Computer"" Bitdefender is very much still amongst the best AV product available, I will without any doubt or question continue to use, as a very satisfied Bitdefender customer.Very many thanks to Bitdefender Technicians, you are very much appreciated."
Customer george smitrh,6,5,had a problem with safepay when doing my banking when I up dated Fierfox. Safeplay still worked in  Google. It took a few weeks to sort out the problem but when they did bitdefender added that time on to the time I add left with them.
Bill A,7,5,"This is simply the best of like products. While other companies brag and boast, Bitdefender performs! The customer service here is impeccable and easy to work with should the need arise."
Matthew Ferguson,1,1,"It starts out when your security runs out in a month or so. So I bought a 39 dollar sale that comes up automatically.  Then your expiring security runs out, they charge you 89 dollars. So I got that refund for 89 dollars, and now they want me to pay for a service charge to get the 39 dollar one to work. The 39 dollar one says its not active. I've been without security for the past week. Really sad, and now I'm thinking about getting a lawyer. Its messed up. This happened to me last year as well. I like there security, but this all around service and so on is not proffesional."

Anders Austegard,1,3,"I have worked by installing Bitfinder.  The customer care is very good,  and I advice anybody having problems with bitfinder to contact them.  However the internet side is confusing.  I used Facebook to log in, then with another emil in my facebook account than when logging into Bitfinder. (I actually have 3 emails I uses regulary)  Things would be much easier if that option did not exist. (Better than no option than an option that only makes problems).The starting menu was also confusing.  When paying they said that an email is sent, but it took a halves hour before I got the email with an activation code.  Actually since I was using Win XP, (Another machien than this) I got an activation code under instalation that I saved, but later forgot to use.  So when the first impression was very bad, was the end impression good.More detaill:At moment Bitfinder works very well. As I said, I have got assistance that helped me, so I does not need more assistance.Order number of purchase: 57516275 About activation code:Straight after I paid it did stand:""The activation code is sent to your email account ...""at the top of the screen. Yes I got an email straight after with the payment receipt (23 Feb 10:28).However, I got an email with an activation code at 23: Feb 11:00. With code 78...This was very confusing. And I wondered if something was wrong. Time from sending an email to I receive it is usually less than 1 minute.If the text was ""The activation code will be sent..."" everything would have been fine.The second problem was that the activation code was useless. The real activation code. The real code that appeared at a net side or at the installation (I does not remember where) and the code is NF...  I wrote the code but forget that I had written it after.  And that was of course my fault.Today I have no problem, but I tell it because if other experience the same it can give a very bad first impression.And again I am very satisfied with the customer care that Bitfinder gives.Thanks"
Nursepkj,1,5,"I purchase 2017 Internet Security from Bitdefender last week. I had a glitch in installation as the code to activate my product was missing. A quick phone call to customer service resolved my issue and in under 5 minutes it was loaded on my systems. I am not computer savvy so, I was very happy with the ease of installation. The software is working well. I would recommend this product."
Richard,1,5,I appreciated the patience and persistence of the Bitdefender support agents in ensuring the problem was resolved.
Henry Phillips,1,5,"I downloaded the ""free"" TotalAV but after I had used the scan TotalV wanted me to purchase the product in order to resolve any issues.  That seems like false advertising to me.  I uninstalled TotalRV and re-installed Bitdefender.  Should never have let in the first place!"
Tim,2,5,"Both Gravityzone and Total Security work excellent. I have tried them both. The best feature is the login interface for Central or Gravityzone. I can get anything accomplished with the console, it's easy to use, I'm solid as a result. Any issue I have had, Tech support had the answers. My systems work very well, I'm staying with Bitdefender. To prove it, I took the time to write this review."
Alex Axenty,1,5,"I like it a lot, the good: professional, thrust worthy, secure, capable; the bad: less options(more hard to find) on newer version, maybe because the interface suffered some changes. Per total the security solution to go for me, I recommend it"
chandramohan,1,5,I find Bitdefender is excellent antivirus soft ware.   Hats off Bitdefender.  The free version itself is great.  I hope that Bitdefender will add more features in the free version.    Thanking you.
Camille Singleton,1,5,He asked the questions he needed and fixed my problem immediately. He had a gentle and patient disposition. Thank you. I hope all of your service representatives are as pleasant.

David Gellibrand,2,5,Bitdefender is razor sharp in saving me from harm as i browse the internet. better than any other program i have utilised.
Girish,1,5,"I have been using this product for a quite while now , but i got an incredibly appreciable support from the company's side and the product is in itself awesome, unlike other antivirus softwares, it doesnt give you any kind of headaches and it is simple in use and user friendly. Very less personal involvement is needed while using bitdefender , it very well know its job.It comes with pc tools also, but i would wish if some more tools like Root kit issues solving as done by CCleaner software , would also be included in the package."
Graham,2,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for nearly two years now and not a single problem to report, The weekly reports are very reassuring and show that Bitdefender has been vigilantly on the job while I'm online. I purchased Bitdefender because the independent testing was consistently high quality, and for PC security nothing but the best is required."
Adrian Kennedy,1,5,"For real security, ease of use, peace of mind, prompt analysis of any problems and a super support team, you will find no better than Bitdefender."
Steve Field,2,2,"I had a terrible installation experience.It rendered my PC unusable for the day.I'm a reasonable person, I understand this can happen sometimes with the best of software.Installing the software caused many programs to stop or fail to load, even causing some windows processes to close.I had paid for Bitdefender, received an activation code but had not, at that time, activated the product.I contacted their support team to request a refund as I had lost confidence in the product, hadn't activated it and intended to uninstall it.I should have uninstalled immediately since, on rebooting my PC, I found I had no desktop, only a collection of dialogue boxes on a black screen:  ""Shell Infrastructure Host has stopped working""  ""Host Process for Windows Tasks has stopped working""  ""NVIDIA Settings has stopped working""Clearly something was seriously wrong!Although I did get an automated response and ticket number from Bitdefender, almost 24 hours later and two further emails from me, they have failed to contact me further.Ticket ID: 2017021610180003I eventually managed to uninstall Bitdefender whilst in Windows 10 SafeMode (accessed via  SHIFT+Restart)I reinstalled Kaspersky and all is now well.I suspect Bitdefender may have too few support staff to give an effective service.Update 19/02/17 10:20 (72 hours later):Dear Steve Field,Please be informed that we are currently working on resolving your Customer Care request, ticket no: 2017021610180003, and will be getting back to you shortly.Thank you for your patience.Regards,Bitdefender Customer Care Team---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Since my 'adventure' with Bitdefender, I can no longer access my client's Solidworks PDM system with my Desktp PC. Luckily I didn't install Bitdefender on my laptop and that connects fine so I will be able to work on Monday.It looks like I may need to format my PC and reinstall everything again!update 20/02/17 09:05  (in case this helps others in my situation)I managed to fix access to my client's Solidworks server to which I connect over VPN. Removal of Bitdefender software caused a change to my hosts file. This line was comment out:#192.168.1.202        solidworksI removed the # and now have access to the server and will therefore be able to work normally today."
Fahim Farook,1,5,"I had read great reviews of Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac and wanted to find out if the reviews were good. I looked around for a good deal for Bitdefender and found a coupon code for Bitdefender Total Solution 2016. I could not find any information about the 2016 version on their site since they had already moved on to the 2017 version but I figured that both versions probably worked the same way and so went ahead and bought the 2016 version.Unfortunately, it turned out that the 2016 version did not support macOS while apparently the 2017 version did. I contacted Bitdefender customer support via the built-in online chat on Bitdefender Central (their main website for handling all your subscriptions and support) and the customer support agent immediately recognized the issue and offered to upgrade me to Bitdefender Total Security 2017. It took no more than 5 minutes to get all this done and compared to other customer support experiences, this was the smoothest and most efficient customer support experience that I've had in a long time!Additionally, my Bitdefender Antivirus has been performing admirably. I had tried another (free) antivirus solution earlier in the day. Their complete scan had run for about 3-4 hours and was not even a quarter of the way through the files on my machine. Bitdefender's complete scan completed within an hour or two and I've barely felt any impact from Bidefender being installed on my machine since then. This has usually not been my experience with antivirus software on the Mac, but then again, I had not tried any antivirus software on the Mac in a few years.Either way, I would highly recommend Bitdefender after this experience!"
Susan Bonin,1,5,"I have been using the Bitdefender since 2013. I feel my laptop computer is secure using this product.  When I have my doubts as to how to change or modify my settings, the custome service department is usually quick to respond and get me back on track.  I really like that I have received the newest version download when things go awry.  Its the user, me,  that has the difficulty, not the product."
Jan T.,7,4,"BD not responding to online webform nor to my last email send over 48hr ago. Disappointed in follow-up. Product itself is okay.... I hope.Update 17.02.: bitdefender promised to cancel 1 subscription and return my money. Also offered 6 months free subscription which has already been received. For now from 1 to 3 stars.Update 17.02: payment has been corrected, money back in my account. Very satisfied with the offered solution, would have been better though if one would have not needed to complain. ID: 2017021309240003"
Maria,10,5,"I have used Bitdefender for quite some time now and I have always been satisfied with it. I feel that I am protected the best way possible and I have only a few times had technical problems, which were easily fixed. The few times I needed support, it was easy to get to chat with them and the support was detailed and easy to understand. I highly recommend Bitdefender."

Guy Smith,1,5,Never a virus on my machine. When I had issues tech support was on it and resolved the issue promptly. Would recommend Bitdefender to any of my friends or family.
Adrian lowe,1,5,before I start I have to say this was my fist and only experience so far of trying to get a problem resolved using their online chat facility. the service was fast and very efficient and the information given was exactly what I needed. A positive experience.
Jim Sinclair,2,5,I have been using Bitdefender for several years.  I have not been troubled by any viruses in that time so it must be doing what is supposed to do. The installation was easy and when I have had problems their customer service has been able to resolve them for me.  I would recommend the program to anyone.
Ffaegawg Afwegaewgreg,1,1,As soon as my subscription expired I decided to uninstall it because i could not afford one anytime soon. But they won't let you do that. It will still be there waiting for you to activate your product. Which really pisses me off. Now i will NEVER renew it. I might even have to reboot my whole system to get rid of it...

Stephen Schwab,1,5,Bitdefender is an excellent protective wall between your computer and all those hackers and ne'er-do-well's who try to improve their own miserable lot in life by stealing from others or who get a kick out of making the lives of others one headache after another.

Dick Wolf,1,2,"Be warned that at the end of this subscription this product will automatically renew without any warning (even though it manages to disrupt what your doing nearly everyday with pop ups telling you you need to restart).  If you didn't wish to renew your subscription getting your money back is going to be next to impossible, as both the live chat and phone personnel will tell you they need to transfer your claim to sales team who will email you.  The trick is they  never email you and you will be stuck paying"
Bharathi Venkat,1,4,"JUst started using Bitdefender Total Security. Bit of a mix up about the number of devices I can use with it. I thought it was 5 but it turns out the one I bought for 1 device. But when I contacted the support team on chat, the guy (Victor Brahas) was very helpful. Explained the problem and also told me they cud upgrade me to the 5 devices one at the cost of two months less on my pack duration. I havent got the email confirming that yet so I dont know how fast their response is but the interaction was friendly enuff so on that end I am happy. Product wise, it has been doing what it claimed so far (have been using a trial version until now for about 20 days). Its quite non -intrusive and the safe pay browser for banking is a good feature.Cant quite figure out how to reply to Bitdefender so doing it this way. I havent received the confirmation email yet but I did try again and was able to install the anti virus on three devices so I'm happy on that end. Works good. The centralized dashboard to manage all devices is a beauty. Good work, guys. I hope I can renew next year at a reasonable cost too."
Haim Dalei,1,2,"I tried to have a support from bitdefender, lets leave the fact that it took them 15 min to answer.so after reaching them i tried to have my old subscription back _total security 2016_ (instead Antivirus plus 2017) but the rep' took an hour to understand what i want as it was very hard to communicate with her.. Bitdefender providing customer service from Romania!Bottom line: you should expect the best product but none less then the worst support you'll ever get."
Roger Bradley,6,1,"Bitdefender use underhand tactics to scam money from you. I purchased their AV 2017, after payment I was taken to site labelled ""Download & Install"". The ONLY link on that page was a green button titled ""Get It Now"". I clicked on this assuming it was a download link. It wasn't, it was a slimy way of getting me to buy their 'install and configure' service for another £19.99!!What a low dirty trick, what you'd expect from the people Bitdefender is supposed to protect us from!I have sent requests for a refund and had NO RESPONSE at all.What a low despicable company."
Frederick Titus,1,3,I pushed and pushed for over 10 days to get BD to recognize I had paid them $80 via PayPal. The whole time I was trying to get them to understand I had paid them and transmit product to me BD was bombing me with scary e-mails warning me my subscription was about to expire. It reminded me of other experiences I have had in Eastern European countries.  Once you get the BD service in your PC it does a good job protecting you – but Boris is slow out of the gate even if you give them 10 days to get it done.  Everything  moves slower over there except the vodka and Putin.
Pheurons,1,5,Their security options & technical support are excellent.Thank you The BD team!
Erik Schrammel,3,5,"I haven't tried the product much yet, but seems to work fine. Customer care is swift and friendly in its response"
Peter How,11,5,Sorted a problem quickly and easily
Dvir,1,5,"I'm not sure what everyone is on about, but my experiences with the BD customer service was very satisfactory, apart from the fact that it did took them longer than I expected to respond.Also, I would like to see the BD team addresses and responds to the many claims of disappointed customers regarding their account renewal.But I can honestly state that from my personal experience with their customer service, once they look into your problem they are very kind and responsive!As for the the software itself - well it's the no.1 security solution for PC's for many consecutive years for a good reason. VERY low on resources and intuitive, definitely the best I've ever used (mainly in comparison to Symantec's products with which I'm familier)."
Matt,1,1,"Well well well, seems like I'm not the only person voicing their concerns.  Firstly, the program itself is not bad to use and self explanatory (nothing to compare it to), but it is ranked and recommended quite highly.  Unless BD has THAT much money to bribe reviewers, I think what your Google is legit.  When you sign up there is no option to turn off automatic renewal, so it just renews after the expiry date.  So why the heck am I getting all these SPAM emails about renewing my licence even though my account is set to auto renew?  OH I KNOW THE ANSWER, you oblige to renewing your account, but it's a NEW account.  The auto renewal activates on your old account and now you're paying DOUBLE fees.  In order to cancel auto renewal, you require to call into BD and speak with someone to cancel.  Even then, I wouldn't even know if my auto renewal has been turned off or not!Which brings me to the next point, their customer service is absolutely horrocious!  They emailed a promotional offer back in December that I couldn't refuse.  Then one month later I get another email saying that I paid again for the full licence.  WHY DO I NEED TWO LICENCES?  Get your act together BD, if I renewed once doesn't your computer system see this and overwrite it?  Since the renewal on Jan 23rd, 2017.  I've received one response from Ioana Deac trying to push more promotions when all I want is a REFUND.  Today is February 7th, 2017, I've received zero responses and you bet I'm going to spam them everyday for a response.  I have 16 days left until the 30 day expiration date and my gut feeling is that these clowns will prolong from responding until after the 30 days are concluded.  Might as well call my credit card company to complain about this fee.  I even went ahead and forwarded the email to Avangate Support Center to voice my concern and got a response, no idea if it was read by a person or automated.Wish me luck!"
Ricci,14,1,"I had an issue with auto repayment; they have moved the payment options from BitCentral to PayPal which I was unaware of. I had a renewal notice but ignored it as I had already purchased a CD myself a lot cheaper that their offer.I raised a case via PayPal and BitDefender kept on asking me to close the case otherwise they could not process the refund stating the following:“Please take your time to obtain the proof of closure. Unfortunately, as mentioned, we cannot proceed with a refund as long as the chargeback dispute is opened on your account”I explained to them that PayPal states the following to safeguard customers....“If you're still working with the seller, please wait until any refunds, returns or replacements have all been completed before you mark this problem as resolved.”After ringing PayPal to explain the hassles I was getting from BitDefender, PayPal ensured I got my full refund of £53.95.The whole process took a month.Since then having 228 days left remaining on my subscription all of a sudden gone. Bitdefender now states I have no subscriptions!!!!Contact customer support by raising a support ticket and as I expected nothing from them, so I’m having to raise support ticket after support ticket to try and get this resolved.Such a shame that their customer support stinks, otherwise this would be a great product, but if you have issues, been warned they will go unheeded. I myself work in the IT field, and people are always asking me for advice on the best Anti Virus software etc, I will of course be telling them to stay clear of this product and go over the hassle I have had with this company."
Ossi Auvinen,1,1,"I've never wrote feedback to any company but now I really feel like doing it. I bought over year ago Bitdefender Antivirus Plus for my computer. Product features was OK, but product and it background programs took 40% of my CPU (Processor) usage all the time. CPU cooler did more noise and I had to always shut down these background tasks from task manager. So annoying. If you're thinking that it's about my CPU, but no it's not. My processor was i7-4710HQ as 3,5Ghz and even demanding games didn't need that much of my CPU Usage. After trying everything I could think of (uninstalled, looked up every forum of same kind of problems, did tweaks to product, set everything back how it was etc.) and nothing helped so I had to uninstall it for good and just stopped using Bitdefender..Now, problems with Bitdefender are back. Not as product but with customer service. My subscription auto renewed. All auto renewal notifications went to my junk email and few weeks ago I got email (did not go to junk box thank god) about my subscription which was renewed and still going.. I contacted customer service and got my answer in about 3-4 days. I was glad that my case was taken to handling, but all I got was partial refund or subscription extension offers! I explained that I don't have computer even anymore and all I want is just full refund of this renewed subscription..29th of the January I received last email from BD that my they will get back to my case shortly. Now over week I haven't received anything about this and I am getting furious..In nutshell:I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH BITDEFENDER, WITH THE PRODUCT AND WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE, NOT EVEN FOR FREE..PS. If someone wants look at my case, here are the ticket no. and order id.Order ID: 56889817ticket no: 2017012313200001"
Hooman Anvari,1,5,Have found this software to live up to expectations. Have also been very satisfied with my customer service to date- got a response immediately and corrected the issue I had. Highly recommended.
Keith,1,4,"This product is second to none, and I would not use anything else.I appreciate that the staff must be very busy, but to get an answer to a simple request surely should not take a week and a half. This request was not about the security, but the length of time I had remaining if I upgraded to Bitdefender 2017. If I had a serious problem with the security of my PC, then I would not be happy with that length of time for a positive answer, but maybe they would respond to security issues faster.Having said that, I still believe this is probably the best product of its type on the market.Good Morning,As I took out subscriptions to this product many years ago, I don't haveany order numbers etc.The open ticket number was 20170111810080003.As I said this has been resolved and no problems, just the length of time.I hope this information is what you need.Regards,keith Harris."
Clinton Yarbrough,3,5,"Great, fast customer service.  I really like the secure transaction browser and the vunerability scan.  It also has secure web browsing.  Overall its a great product with too many features for me to talk about.  I am totally satisfied, and I feel much safer online now."
Dinko V.,1,5,"Incredibly accurate, polite and professional BitDefender Customer Care helped me to in merging two accounts without any problems. Something you cannot see and experience every day on internet.Software itself is great so it does not need any  additional praises :)"
Benny Mason,1,4,It took about 4 days for each answer to go and come (took about 4 weeks to resolve....
Erik Jordens,8,1,"On 2016-12-30 I tried to renew the license of my Bitdefender Internet Security for XP/Vista for the year 2017. As the Bitdefender websites are a sort of confusing, in particular if one want's to find a specific program or software. I got lost in a chaos of pages when I searched and could not find the instructions and download for Windows XP/Vista for 2017. Because of that and by mistake I bought and downloaded at first the complete useless: Bitdefender Internet Security 2017 which can not run on a Vista machine. The details of this purchase: Factuurnr: 161233174, Date: 2016-12-30,  Ordernumber: BC-3961108. When I tried to install Bitdefender Internet Security 2017 the existing Bitdefender software for 2016 was completely removed from my computer and I discovered that my first investment of 33,98 Euro was a complete waste. After this frustrating experience I searched further on the Bitdefender websites and finally found a possibility to download a version of Bitdefender Internet Security for XP/Vista 2015. I had to pay again 33,98 for a license and installed the software. To my great surprise this version was using the French Language which was not my intention as I had used in 2015 and 2016 a Dutch language version. On the same day, 2016-12-30 I prepared a message in which I requested a refund of 33,98 Euro for the unusable license for the Bitdefender Internet Security  2017 (not appropriate for a Vista OS). A very justified request as Bitdefender promotes a 30 days money back rule on it’s website.Furthermore in this message to the Bitdefender Support Center I stipulated that I was very unhappy with the French Language and indicated that I preferred Dutch. I received a willing and helpful reply from Djan Muftarofski, Bitdefender Support Team (Open ticket: 2016123017320001). The technical assistance which I received from Djan was exemplary and solved ultimately my language problem. Furthermore Djan informed me in the following message (date 2017-01-20):________________________________________________________Beste Ruud,Dank u wel voor uw reactie.Eerst en vooral willen we onze verontschuldigingen aanbieden voor de situatie die is ontstaan en voor de vertraging van ons antwoord.Ik wil u vriendelijk mededelen dat wij alles hebben doorgegeven naar uw doorverkoper.Zij zullen u zo spoedig mogelijk via mail contacteren.Ruud, hou alsjeblieft u mail in de gaten.Ik wens u een fijn weekend!Met vriendelijke groet,Djan MuftarovskiBitdefender Support Team________________________________________________________Next I received the following offensive and manipulative message:From: Klantenservice Bitdefender - EptimumDate: 2017-01-31 12:52To: mailSubject: Re: Fw: [Ticket#: 201701185002039] Refund for E.R. JordensBeste klant,Aangezien dat de factuur van Datum:2016-12-30 is, kunnen wij helaas nieks meer doen.Met vriendelijke groet,Ibbela Ibbela,Bitdefender - Particuliers (BE)_______________________________________________________As the technical assistance provided by Djan Muftarovski I found exemplary and very helpful contrary to the reaction of Ibbela Ibella which is appalling and certainly not justifiable as the date I submitted my refund request was in fact the same day as I purchased the two licenses. Browsing through the Bitdefender reviews I discovered that I’am definitely not the only one who is maliciously cheated by the “Klantenservice Bitdefender – Eptimum”, the list of 1 star ratings is long and concerns practically always a very justfied and reasonable request for a refund."
スーリヤ マイカ,1,5,"It' a good, very easy to use and excellent protection for a computer or laptop ever need. It does not consume a lot of the computer or laptop main memory, but it does slow down my web surfing when it is doing an update in the background and it is very nuisance to me. Well, Bitdefender should have a look at this matter or is it just me (my computer). I'm running Windows 10 pro, if my PC can handle Windows 10 Pro, I think it should not have any problem(s) running Bitdefender Internet Security 2017. As an over all, EXCELLENT!!!!....."
Stephen Qualtrough,1,4,"Well designed software, very helpful support."
Keith,10,5,"Have been using Bitdefender for several years and can say that I have had no problems.Product works very well, the price is good considering the level of security it provides and also the level of customer support that the company offers. Recommended without hesitation."
Harry Koulountis,1,5,I tried trial versions of all major security products and used the OS built in ones. None compare to Bitdefender. It is a fantastic product.
Penny Mahar,2,5,"I have utilized several different anti virus, malware programs in the past and I have found Bitdefender to exceed my expectations"
Tom Kaletta,1,5,Bitdefender's chat service is preemo deluxe. He understood my challenge and had a solution for the problem quickly. It was an excellent experience and it DID fix things as I had hoped.
Tricked,1,1,"I see a lot of 5 star ratings and I think they are from Bitdefender personnel. I fell for the free upgrade scam and lost protection on two of my devices, had choice of waiting 24-48 to use my computer or buy another subscription. 4 hours and $45 later and presto- I was back in business on my computer. The moment I read a review saying another program works as well as Bitdefender I switch all of my computers away from Bitdefender."
Torr Quemado,1,5,"On the rare occasions when I've needed support, I have been treated with the utmost respect and diligence. There was one time when the agent didn't know the answer (it was a rather complex billing question I wanted to know) he/she did contact me with a very thorough explanation of what the solution and options would be. Afterwards, went through with me all the way until I had my issue solved to the very last bit of my satisfaction. Congratulations and please, please, never lower that standard, it's golden!"
HALUSIAK Daniel,2,5,Five stars products and consumer services
terence,15,5,had to contact customer service .excellent service product good
Dave Dye,1,5,"Recently left Kaspersky and went to Bitdefender.  Already very happy with no interruptions, messages that I don't understand and Bitdefenders auto pilot.  Bitdefender and I just started going together, we'll see how the relationship goes from here, so far, I love it."
Dr Whittles,1,3,"This is a great program that is significantly better than Norton or McAfee for the price. I have not had any issues with the antivirus or anti-malware technology. The only and one of the most frustrating issues is it wants to restart my computer about 3 times a week because it has ""updated"" the purpose of any antivirus software is to protect you and do it in a non-intrusive way. The pop up occur no matter what I'm doing and will often minimize what I was working on to show me. I will not be renewing my service when it expires because of this reason."
Ken Petersen,19,1,"I am trying to cancel my auto renewal right now, it is not possible to do from their platform, you have to talk to support. I just got the question ""when will this happen"" twice, as if they can't see from my account.The fact that this ""feature"" is not possible to control from the admin panel screams scammy company to me.Then i get the question ""where did you purchase the product"". I purchased it from them... Am i really to believe that they don't know where their customers purchased their product ?They make you jump through hoops hoping you will give up. The product itself registers everything you surf on, sends you monthly ""security reports"". SSL protection is buggy and intercepts everything you do as well. They bundle a lot of useless stuff that slows down your PC as well.Chat transcript included below:-----------------------------------------------------------------Welcome to Bitdefender Support. How may I help you today?Hi, for some weird reason it is very very hard to disable automatic renewal, i wonder why.... I want to turn off autorenewal for my account, i don't want to jump through hoops, find order numbers, register with avantgate.

You have been warned :)"
Tobias Engwall,1,5,"I bought the ""Total security"" edition and have had it for close to 2 years now. It's an excellent product for a (relatively) cheap price, especially when you buy the ""3 devices"" version and split it with some friends.The program is really intuitive and easy to understand. It also scans quickly (or a total scan if you want) and has a large variety of other useful functions such as shortening your computer's startup time, cleaning out junk files and even protecting your computer from ransom attacks/theft.I've only encountered one minor issue so far and that got fixed quickly thanks to their truly amazing customer service, the best I've ever encountered. I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
Avnish Mehta,1,1,"When i dealt with Bitdefender support regarding my order issue in Aug 2015, it was a pleasant experience. Unfortunately, in Jan 2017 my experience made sure that this is the last time i bought anything from them. They are manipulative cheats. When I bought Total Security and completed payment, it took me to a page which had a button saying download and install. Turned out it was a manipulation to sell another product. Since they had my card information already, all i got was the order confirmation notification rather than asked to confirm purchase. I raised request to cancel that within few minutes. Even after 16 days, no action or response. Intentions are clear. Shame on these guys.Addendum: could not find a way to add comments. So, adding to original post. - finally i got my refund yesterday that is 19 days after i logged the ticket and three days after social media posts."
nonyafingbus,2,1,"Go ahead and read all the crap that Bitdefender publishes for their glorious support, but then make a small effort to actually engage with their support.  Bitdefender support is an illusion, it does not actually exist.  I challenge you to make meaningful contact with bitdefender support because it is impossible.  I also question whether bd should  be catagorized as malware because of their unscrupulous and forceful product upgrade impositions."
Andrew,4,3,"Bitdefender Internet Security as a product has been good. I've been a user for a little over 12 months with no real problems. When I tried contacting Bitdefender support for the first time however, it became obvious to me that Bitdefender like getting new customers, but supporting existing ones is an annoyance more than anything else.Long story short, after enquiring about extending my licence, Bitdefender, out of the blue, completely cancelled my licence, leaving me unprotected. Their excuse? I didn't purchase my licence via one of their ""approved partners"". All attempts to get any more information have been met with very slow, and ultimately dismissive replies. My 2 year licence key activated and worked fine for 12 months, and then was cancelled. Bitdefender are now treating me like a pirate even though I had a working and paid licence key, which would have still been working had I not contacted them for support. I just wanted to know what I'd done wrong. Apparently that is too much to ask however. Internet security is too important to risk on a company with these levels of service. There are too many other companies with products just as good. Their product is generally ok, but their service levels are appalling.Edited in Response to Bitdefender: Thank you Bitdefender for the reply. My Ticket Id is/was 2017010909140004.Edit 2:Thank you again Bitdefender for sorting it out.So I've received a bad licence key from the seller it would seem? Not Bitdefender's fault if that is the case. My only concern would be, why did it activate successfully, and work for 12 months without a problem? I would have assumed (or expected) that bad/reused licence keys would be detected and invalidated automatically? Had I known it was a bad key when I first purchased it and tried to activate it, I could have sought a refund, but this was practically impossible after the key had been working for 12 months.No matter. I can confirm that my subscription has been restored, and for that I thank you. I have revised my original 1 star rating in response. Honestly it could have been handled better by Bitdefender support, but at least it is rectified now.Edit 3 (In reply to Bitdefender ""Update 2""): I'm sorry. I would have just left this case alone, if it was not for your ""Update 2"" post. You are completely incorrect, and this seems like an obvious attempt to rewrite history. You state: ""Periodic checks are constantly made to find and detect pirated license keys. ... This is the honest answer.""This IS NOT an honest answer. My licence key WAS NOT found by a ""periodic check"". My licence key was found and invalidated as a direct result of when I contacted support to enquire about purchasing an add-on licence key for more devices.Had I not contacted support, triggering someone (i.e. a human) to look at my account, my licence key would not have been instantly invalidated, and would still be working to this day. If you wish, I would be happy to post the support emails I received so your customers and potential customers can read first hand just how ordinary the levels of support were in this case (automated and irrelevant replies, long delays, etc).Disappointingly, your ""Update 2"" post undid some of the good will you earned back by fixing my issue."
Philip Loxton,1,5,excellent customer feedback
Gerald Crusador,1,5,"I had a number of problems with both my Mac and PC subscription until I found I could combine the subscriptions with Bitdefender Total 2017.  This was brought to my attention by Alina Bizga at Customer Care, and a roll-over of the subscriptions was made solving my frustration.  Way to go, people! *****"
Sheila Carson,1,1,I had Total Security 2016 and my old laptop pc was hacked by a bitcoin virus. Thought I'd give them one more chance so I now have Total Security 2017 on my new HP laptop.  Their security scan suggested that my Windows 10 admin password was weak and to change it via their software.  I did and now I've been locked out of my pc for WEEKS!!  None of my passwords work. They won't call me and all they do is send me one lame email a week saying they're working on my ticket.  INEXCUSABLE!     Worst security software ever made!! Ticket # is:2017011605060001.   PLEASE FIX ASAP!
Pascal de Weerd,1,2,"Had some problems with mobile security, and asked for support by email. 8 days later, their first respons, and send them back some information that same day. Now, again waiting for 7 days to get an answer. Always loved the product, but customer care is something their not familiar with.Update 2 February: American support took over from Holland after this complain, and solved the problem in 2 email sessions. For the inconvenience they gave me a free subscription for one year on mobile security. Thanks very much USA team, that's how it should be handled."
Jim Rider,1,5,"PEOPLE; I TELL YOU A TRUTH !  , , , THIS IS, IN MY BEST OPINION THE BEST COMPLETE ANTI VIRUSPROGRAM I'VE EVER USED !  AND I'M NOT A PRO. BUT AFTER USING IT ON THREE PERSONAL PC'SAND NO LONGER HAVING TO CONSTANTLY PAY OUT OF POCKET, TO HAVE THE HARD DRIVES CLEANED.ALONG WITH WATCHING THIS BIT DEFENDER STOP THE THREATS , I CAN WATCH MY MONEY AT WORK !I MUST RATE THIS PROGRAM, THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN, IN ACTION ! , , , SIGNED; KOOLAIDKID  ( SOUTH GEORGIA )"
Connie Carver,1,5,"Alexandria was an exceptional young knowledgeable , and helpful young lady. she was very kind and had a lot of patience to help me get the bitdefender set up. I was pleased with everything she helped me with.C Carver"
SMXL,1,4,"I renewed my yearly subscription service in November during the Black Friday sale. Without my approval, they renewed my service again for $89. i sent multiple emails and even talked to a sales rep who was suppose to assist with sending details on my refund. I never heard from her nor received any responses to the multiple emails that I sent. I also spent over an hour on hold trying to reach the customer support team again, but gave up.This company is unethical and does not care about quality customer service. There are multiple reviews on this website regarding their auto renewal process and customer service but obviously they don't care since the same incidents keep occurring. I now reported them to by credit company.-----------------------------------The order number is 56863366, it's now been two weeks and still no refund and terrible customer service. I have done everything bitdefender has asked. I even sent screen shots showing  my dispute with PayPal was closed (which bitdefender could of looked up themselves). I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life.------------------------------------Terrible experience at first, but they more then compensated for their error. Changing my rating from 1 start to 4 stars."
Carla White,2,5,"The program is fast, efficient and user friendly.  I bought it to use on a computer with Windows Vista and I have had no problems at all.  Even with Microsoft discontinuing their support for Windows Vista, Bitdefender 2015 still supports and protects my computer 100%.  Customer Service quickly works to send you everything you need and is available 24/7.  I high recommend Bitdefender for all of your antivirus protection."
Melody Croft,1,5,"I recently purchased Bitdefender and accidently purchased the Window rather than the Mac version.  I notified the support team and in a few days, I had the correct product installed on my computer.  Hassle free!"
Mark McElroy,1,4,"The 2016 BitDefender has given me good service up to the beginning of 2017. Then I got locked out of an account - it would appear because I did not have the 2017 version. I am at a loss as to why this did not become an automatic download during the early days of 2017.I am also annoyed that the company has decided, against my wishes, to purchase a new contract automatically!!Additionally, there does not appear to be a phone contact to solve problems such as the one i have mentioned above."
simon,1,5,"I've tried Norton, Kaspersky, McAfee, Webroot and others that never touched what Bit has done for me. Last four years were under Norton's watch and even then we became riddled with malware and viruses which were disabling Norton. Norton techs would send me a new download link to reinstall their program. I was on my 5th time around re-downloading Norton, still never getting rid of the issues when I then decided then to try another Anti-virus program.Once install was completed, Bitdefender found numerous little infecting boogers and killed what it could, but I still had issues. Contacted Bitdefender and with very timely responses on their part, they ended the rein of evil from my PC. Sorin (tech), perform a desktop remote and I watch as he went through programs with amazing speed wiping out infections that once brought my PC to a stand still. He even called while in process and explained some of what he was doing speaking better English then me...and he lives in Romania! How cool is that!?When finished, Sorin sent a log to Lab to verify all was clean and 2 days later Sorin wrote back assuring my PC is now 100% safe. Sorin is now my best friend in the PC world, and thank you Bitdefender for your honest secure well made anti-virus program that does exactly what your ad says it will. 30 years as a commercial builder in California, USA, and if I could only get all my subs to perform the way Bitdefender does, I'd own the building market!! I'm not paid to write this, I have plenty of my own money. Also I am a devout Christian so it would do me no good to lie either. This company uses top notch techs who know what they are doing and do it quick. ""Bitdefender wiped out what was wiping out Norton!"" Too funny, think about it, Bitdefender cleaning up after Norton's failure who is suppose to be No: 1 antivirus software? Bitdefender is Top Dog in the anti-virus world and I stand by every word I said is true and sure. Thank you Bit and thanks for allowing Sorin to spend time on my PC without charging me for any tech time!!"
Igor Vishnevsky,1,5,Stable and reliable work of the software. Several antiviruses failed to clean WinRamnit virus on my PC. Bitdefender did not)). I shall prolong the license next year.
Liz Seigle,1,1,"In December 2016, I did an online search to determine the best internet security software and came upon PC Magazine's website, which named and rated several companies highly. On December 30, 2016, I decided to go with Bitdefender, went to their website, paid for the product using my credit card, and attempted to download and install the software.  I had difficulty installing the software, though I have had much experience installing various software programs during the past 25 years.  I decided to request a refund, rather than request technical support from bitdefender. I called the company on the same day and requested a refund. They have given me the run-around and refuse to give me an address for their operations in the United States, stating only, ""We are headquartered in Romania."" I spoke with Bitdefender by phone on January 8 and told them I need the refund credited to my VISA by January 12. I also put this in an email to them. Today is January 19, 2017, and I have not received a refund from them. If you go with this company and decide after a day or two that you do not like their product, you may lose your money."
Marc Jalbert,1,5,Although I cannot connect with other than your Antivirus 2015 given I am running XP I have come to realize a very comfortable reliance on you for protection.  You're allowing me to remain connected with the secure knowledge that you are there.

Kirill Kanyuk,1,2,"Bought 29.12.2016 Antivirus. After some time the use of realized that it does not suit me, and decided to return the money. Written by more than 4 letters in support since 16.01.2017. No answer so far (18.01.2017). Apparently the company is waiting for the end of 30 days period. Be sure to turn off auto-renew, and delete information on your credit card! I want to consult with my bank as you can get my money back! Ticket 201701161800000620.01.2016 The money returned. I wish you to improve the quality of customer support. Very poor quality of customer service"
Max Poulsen,15,1,"I can’t recommend anyone to bitdefender as long as there is no possible support to get, if you experience a problem.This is my experience:I purchased a new subscription for Antivirus 2017 up to 3 devices back in November (black Friday offer). I didn’t activate the code I received until 3. January and then it comes to my attention that these 3 devices only coveres PC’s and not general devices as I thought.As I am using only Mac computers I contacted the Bitdefender chat support immediately after the activation. 1st  contact attempt. 3.Jan I got in contact with an support agent, but didn’t get any usefull support, and at the end I was left waiting in the chatroom with no reply from the support agent. After more than 10 minutes of waiting I gave up, and closed the chat.2nd  attempt 3.Jan New agent contacted explaining the problem, and the agent would escalate the case, and reply back within short. (I received an e-mail stating that will be contacted with my request)3rd attempt 8.Jan New agent, I explain that nothing has happened with my first ticket, and I would like to know a status on my first contact. The agent were looking into the matter, but left me waiting in the chatroom. I end up being kicked out of the chat due to inactivity, only because I did what the agent toldt me to (wait)4th attempt 8.JanNew agent again. (me starting to lose my patience) explaining again, and the agent promised to talk to his colleagues to speed things up. I underlined that this was the 4th. Attempt and I don’t want to wait forever for a solution.5th attempt 13. Jan New strategy: now I’m trying by e-mail.I wrote a long e-mail now, where it lined up the attempts above. Stating that I now have lost my patience and don’t want to be left in the dark any longer. I request a solution now or a refund of my money.I then received an autogenerated e-mail stating the following“Dear Max, First of all, thank you for choosing Bitdefender to protect your computer. You can find “How To's” and self-help articles in our dedicated web page Webpage link removed:If there's anything that is not covered in our web page, or you require additional help, please reply to this email .Have a wonderful day!Bitdefender Customer Care Team “W T F: after several attempts I now spend a long time actualy writing you and e-mail. And all I get is an auto generated e-mail referring me to a webpage, or ask me to WRITE ANOTHER E-MAIL if I wish them to read my first e-mail.What kind of B*** S*** is this. how can you treat your customers like this?6th attempt. 13.JanI (now furious) write the e-mail, asking the support to read my first e-mail 3 days after I receive another auto-generated e-mail“Dear Max, Please be informed that we are currently working on resolving your Customer Care request, ticket no: 2017011308420001, and will be getting back to you shortly. Thank you for your patience.Regards,Bitdefender Customer Care Team “Today 18.JanStill no answer. Therefore this post on trustpilot.As I understand in several reviews Bitdefender should actualy be a very good product, which I unfortunately can’t either confirm or dismiss as I still haven’t tried the full program.What I can confirm is that Bitdefenders customer service is in the top 3 of the worst customer services or supports I have ever experienced. Which is why I award it with only 1 star, this is only because 0 was not an option.I really can’t understand why it can take so long time to NOT resolve my problem. And who it can be called customer support, when all that is happening is that customers is being keept as hostage. I do feel that Bitdefender is completely ignoring my requests for support, and that I am being stalled for absolutely no reason. I do hope that this post actually reaches some ones desk. Someone who actually is willing to show some ownership, and get things done.These Are the ticket no's i have so far. 201701032151000520170103220800042017010322090004201701081921000220170108193700032017011308420001"

V anu,1,5,Really this is a Amazing antivirus with its autopilot it never affect my pc performance and malware dectecting ratio is lot more better than kaspersky and norton I love bitdefender
Himavat Ishaya,1,5,
Marco Heemskerk,3,5,"The program and the service is great. I have the program on 8 devices. No virus infections and no problems, except on one. With help of the service-department, that problem is solved now. I recommend the program to anyone. But there is one thing to mention: it is a little expensive. Look for sale-offers, also when renewing the program. It will save you money.Bitdefender: please stop with sale-offers and make the program less expensive when renewing. Than it could be the best virus-program ever!!"
David,1,5,"I have been using bit defender for over 4 years. I use it at home and for business. It has multiple features you can tweak or just leave it on auto pilot and it takes care of the machine. Bit defender central, let's me see at a glance the status of all my PC's, either at home or at the shop or when I am traveling. It is very helpful. It's a great product, it many features, and customer service is willing to help."
Japie Greeff,1,5,"I had a small hiccup in the purchase and installation process while switching over from mcaffee to bitdefender. Reached out to the support team and they responded within 5 minutes of getting my request and answered all of my questions sufficiently for me to be able to continue.I really feel it was a great interaction, and I feel confident they would be able to handle any queries I have in the future. I would definitely recommend bitdefender for their support."
Bryan Ferguson,1,4,"I purchased Bitdefender Family Pack 2017. I was able to successfully install Antivirus for Mac on some of my computers but was unable to install Antivirus for Mac on one of my iMacs and one of my MacBook Pros. The technical support I received was excellent. They emailed me step-by-step instructions to reboot in single-user mode and enter commands to resolve a system file problem. My only disappointment is the long wait in between email correspondences--it took 10 days to receive a response after my first question (granted it was Christmas holiday) and 5 days for each of two subsequent questions. In the end, the competent advice was worth the wait."
g,1,1,"Base on reviews bought this a year ago via avangate.com.  Like others here, got renewals notices for about  a month with killers deals in Dec, some as low as $30 or so.  I almost did renew but decided against it.Then in Jan I get an email saying $90 has been charged to my credit card; what the heck?!  They say I signed up for auto-renewal; uh, No I did not!Called and wrote avangate tech support; they say they can't issue a refund w/o OK from bitdefender, so they send an email to BD (and cc'd me) asking for a refund.  A week goes by and no response from BD.  So I file a dispute case with my CC company yesterday.  All of the sudden I hear from BD wanting to give me a discount; SERIOUSLY???!!!Just issue a refund for crying out loud!  F****** crooks!!!UPDATE: Responding to BD response below:You sent me an email about the discount offer ONLY after I started a dispute case w/my CC company.  This was Jan 13, 2017.  I responded to that email within a few minutes, saying no thanks, just issue my refund.  Still no response to my email 4 days later.  I.e. great PR, but lousy customer service and downright crooked business practices..!   BTW: UI is in-decipherable by user IMO (and I develop software).Still waiting for my money back that you stole...Update: Dec 2017.  After all the wrangling with BD, I finally got my refund, but again, this was ONLY after I filed a dispute with my credit card company!  Still get BD spam almost weekly asking me to renew; seriously?!  Sorry I ever signed up with them in the first place.."
cam,2,1,"I purchased a new subscription back in November. The activation code doesn't work, and Bitdefender is completely ignoring my requests for help. While I can't fault their anti-virus software, when things go wrong they're nowhere to be seen. Avoidedit 24/1/17 - sure, my request number is 1028514"
Daniel Jung,1,3,"Installing the software blocks every Internet connection (WiFi or ethernet). Customer service is completely incompetent (as stated in a couple reviews of the product I had seen). After offering the most basic of services (try connecting/disconnecting your wifi/ethernet) to repair my Internet connection, they told me they will be charging almost $80 for a yearly plan to offer additional services (I can get a better antivirus software with no history of disabling the internet for about 2+ years with this money). Their automated machines for the help desk are hard to hear as well. If you look at the tech forums for common problems that you may have with the software, you will see that they are not helpful at all. The company does not even bother updating the solutions even after so many bad reviews. When I did a full scan with the software, it only found one threat as opposed to two threats when I had run a trial version of another antivirus program.Of course, it may be due to its incapability to update since Bitdefender blocked the Internet connection. The program uses more RAM and takes up more memory than it did with the other program I had used (came with the newly purchased laptop). Even though I got the version with the Firewall module, I found it impossible to activate it (since I did not have Internet connection). I wanted to see if I could restart before uninstalling to  see if I can get the Firewall module activated while the device was running. I could not get the device to stop running on the Windows 10 laptop. I could not even turn it off from starting automatically in the startup programs list. To Uninstall the program, I had to restart my computer several times. It may be nothing unusual, but up til now, I have only had antivirus software (some much better than Bitdefender in performance and price) that did not require a restart for uninstall.Edit: It did take a while for them to respond (I think 1 or 2 weeks) but the tech support gave me an email explaining step by step of what I should do (ie, turn specific modules off). (I guess send emails to tech support instead of calling.) The program somehow corrected itself and all modules I own are fine. The program did find what it called as Trojans (bunch of random text files) in my computer while I was using it. It gives you an option to delete the file or restore it. (So, I guess the software works?) The program did not explain if restoring the file would restore what it identified as a Trojan. I could not figure out a way to view the file myself without going into Windows Explorer  (or programs like 7 zip) and looking at my hidden folders. So, if you already own the software, give it another go and turn off all modules to try and figure out which one is affecting your Wifi."
Yappydog Discovery,7,3,"Bitdefender was used on 3 office computers last year which worked perfectly, we paid for another years subscription + we need to add bitdefender to more computers so we added another subscription which has never worked so we contacted customer service on 03.01.17 but we had no reply nothing was sorted.I have tried again today 16.01.17 to contact Bitdefender customer care for the 5th time after the response from Bitdefender below I will update this post if they do contact me or if the problem is sorted.An update on 24.01.17 I supplied all the information requested I received an automated acknowledgement ticket number 201701170923000 but NOTHING And on 25.01.17 they sorted the problem!! an apology for the delay in dealing with the matter I can now use Bitdefender on 6 computers!! so nearly 3 weeks to sort out this problem but they eventually did sort it out.Another update on 01.02.17 an email from bitdefender: ""deepest apologies, an unacceptable amount of time to solve a rather simple and straight-forward request""I have extended your Internet Security subscription by one year and a half.I also made the subscription valid for up to 10 devices, instead of 6So all sorted and everyone is happy"
R Carlson,2,3,"If you're reading this review then your expectations are high, like my own.  You and I expect a great product combined with great service. I've been using Bitdefender a couple of years now. Since my purchase, my PC has been protected without fail. Software is easily navigated and will draw you in to learn about some great features. Not just Antivirus but system protection. Recently I contacted BD support regarding an upgrade. The response time was 24 hours and resolved in one email. From one email I recognized immediately a high level of professionalism and knowledge. I don't normally provide reviews or recommendations. However,  for this service I make the exception. I am confident when I write, ""I hope you do go for it""1010/19 - I discontinued use of Bitdefender about nine months ago. Customer service has become at best poor and I no longer use Bitdefender. I can only guess it because management wants to save a dollar. Penny wise and Pound foolish. Autorenew reviews are also correct. What is going on? Great product with questionable customer protections. The line drawn has become very clear."
Pastor Jain,1,5,excellent apps.. no problem when it comes to customer care.. great job bitdefender..
Julie Hutt,1,4,Tried Bitdefender for the first time.  Didn't get my access code right away but messaged them and they resolved the issue.  Customer service was easy to deal with; I would recommend them.
lerob,1,2,"Took a day to install with blue screen of death, dll files not found and firefox reporting invalid certificates from their web page. Finally got it running but three times contacted chat and three times they didn't know the answer and escalated it. Raised several support tickets by email and while I got many automated 'thank you' replies it has now been well over a week and so far no real person has offered any support at all.  Note that the mobile phone anti theft features are useless. To lock your stolen phone you send an SMS to it containing an unlock pin - which is then displayed on the stolen phone for the thief to see! what good is that?"

Major Singh,2,5,"I received lot of help, My PC is 10years old running good as new , They saved me £350 , I only paid £29.99 for Bitdefender."
Nigel Ward,1,3,"I had a good deal for Bitdefender with an automatic renewal. What a nightmare. Near to the end of one year I received multiple emails asking if I wanted to renew at great prices. Eventually I received the renewal notice which was higher than the offers given by email. I contacted customer service and they advised that I cancel the automatic renewal from Avangate and renew with the offer given by email. This I did, however it did not link to my current account so I only received 365 days and didn't take in to account what my current account had. Customer service again resolved this issue, however I continued to receive emails stating my account was going to expire. Bitdefender and their agent for payment Avangate need to talk to each other. The security system is great and well worth the money, but look for the great deals. I found $29.99 for 5 devices/1yr.Not sure how to reply to a response but what was required is: 2016122205180001"
Steph,1,1,They actually completed my un-completed sale after sending me an email to notify me of said uncompleted transaction. Now they will not refund. I have used the antivirus for the last 4 years and loved it. Now I will not give these crooks my money!
Zexivian Nightcore (Ivan Perrett),1,5,"This product is rated as the best antivirus; for good reason. Not only does it to a superb job in protecting my laptop from any intrusions, but the layout for the control menu of the product is also very clean and easy to use.The customer support team courteously replied to my silly issue and it was quickly cleared up. Recommending this product to others."
Mark R Hofbrandt,1,1,"I bought this 1 year ago, and now 1 year later WITHOUT ANY notice they pull almost 60 dollars from my account for another year.Who the fck said i wanted another year!?!? A HEADS UP PERHAPS JEEZ? How come i dont have to approve this?!? Screw you guys from bitdefender."
M John Clark,1,5,"During Renewal of Protection, I ran into a problem of computers with different Windows versions which caused the older versio (Vista) to require a different  upgrade.I 'played'' for two hours trying to solve myself without success.Finally I found a Telephone number for BitDefender help. Called and within 15 minutes Problem Solved.Suggest better info on this situation of differing versions, plus easier access to phone number when help is needed.Thank You for a Great Product, which I have used fo many years."
zhuo jiang,1,5,Now the 90 days free trial is failure?
David,1,5,some account conflicts got resolved via Chat within 5 minutes.  Excellent and efficient service.  Previous attempts to fix it (a year ago) failed.  An encouraging turnaround in service level.
Adam Brown,2,5,"I've had BitDefender for 8 years now, and never have I not been impressed with the interaction between the representatives and I, whenever I have a question. They never give up! Honestly, I've never seen a customer care department so adamant on seeing through to the end of an issue, even if that means it will take them weeks to solve. I mean that. I've raised some complex questions in the past, and even though it may be that I'm the first to ask, they never quit until a resolution is found.And that's just the customer care. The performance of the software is superb. I've said ""Goodbye!"" to all of the typical names like Norton or McAfee, which tend to get imposed on PC customers, since they usually come with the machine. Nope! I did my research and noticed that BitDefender has remained in the #1 spot for performance and reliability on a global market scale. The interface is straight to the point, with a no nonsense method of simplifying the process of maintaining a healthy machine. Doesn't bog down the system either. One of my machines is 10 years old, and shows no signs of slowing down due to the protection software. Last piece is the website, where you can manage your account. It's the first of its kind, in my experience, that meshes very well with whatever group of software subscriptions I might have. The painless interfaces that BitDefender has provided to customers like me, means saving me a lot of time in an ever-busy world that I live in."
Geoff King,1,3,"Bitdefender is good because of its ransomware protection, but you need to work on the heavy drag on computer resources.Despite what the advertising says, BD is NOT light on my computer."
Judith Austin,1,5,"Bitdefender has continued to receive high ratings since I first began using their Total Security program in 2014. Each year since then, I receive an email renewal reminder, which makes it very easy and convenient to continue with their security service. Recently, I installed their 2017 Total Security program using their very straightforward email instructions, which went well.At start ups, I like their small lower right window that appears, reminding you that Bitdefender is actively working and that no concerns have been detected. You are also reminded about the number of days of service remaining and when you last updated. Everything about the program is so easy to navigate as well because Bitdefender has developed a very user friendly format.If you ever have a question, you can actually call and speak with someone who is always quite knowledgeable, polite and interested in helping you. For all these reasons, I am very pleased with the Bitdefender products and their reliable service."
Ian Anderson,1,5,"Bitdefender is very trustworthy, customer care is fast and efficient, their products are amazing, and I would recommend this product to anyone."
Jesse Forsell,1,4,"Simple, effective and doesn't get int the way of gaming which is important for gamers. Also the first antivirus that made me buy it! I find it easy to find all the settings I want those are what i think based on my first week of use. If it works as well for a whole year then count in that fifth star"
Darryl Edwards,1,5,"This is really thorough software from a excellent company.  I appreciated the unexpectedly high level customer care very much.  The steps and system labels on how to navigate my up to date OSX for my mac were not ideal.  Overall, my experience was excellent, and brought me to the solution.  It turns out the issue was with my web hosting service, and not with malware or a virus at all.  I figured that out only because Bitdefender was thorough and informative.  YAY!"
J. Landry,2,5,The only reason I had to contact Bitdefender on more than one occasion is because of my inability to follow each direction as indicated and defin itely not through any fault of Bitdefender. They were very thorough and patient with me and I have nothing but good things to say about them. Excellent job.    Thank you
Glen Broemer,1,1,"terrible company.  i stopped using it a few months after purchasing a year's subscription.  the next year they deducted 89 from my account without contacting me.  i notified them immediately and they've done nothing to refund it.  i had fewer problems with the free version of avast.  i also had to ask them for a removal tool to get the program off my computer, as it isn't removed in the control panel the way that most programs are. ticket number 2016122623210003  a good example, they ask me for the order number, though do not give me a way to respond--have to wonder if the same stellar logic goes in to the program."

Jeff Buys,1,5,Bitdefender Total Security has not let me down when it comes to Protecting my computer from malware and the like. I also like the way it optimizes very fast. It has everything I need to give me a complete Security solution.
Nicole Weidemann,1,5,"Not only that Bitdefender found a Troyan as I installed it, which other Programmes didn't see, but might have caused for longer a problem, they also really help you personal on your needs, when you have a problem. Very nice. Thanks! For me their is no better Anti Virus Programm as Bitdefender."
Timothy C.,2,5,"I have developed serious respect for Bitdefender products and customer service since I switched from a competitor in 2015.  Bitdefender AV detection & protction ratings continue to outpace the competition year on year.  The user interface of the Total Security desktop program & mobile apps is straightforward and unobtrusive.  The impact on performance on Windows or Android is negligible, I highly recommend these products.Pricing is fair for 5 / 10 devices, for unlimited devices - with a central management console - the cost is excellent value.As an added bonus - when you have a technical or account management issue - there is a friendly knowledgeable team available 24/7-  by chat or phone.If only all products & companies could be this good ;-)"

Autopilot does basically everything for you and i haven't noticed any drawbacks on the side of system performance.In addition, i contacted Customer service twice and both times it greatly exceeded my expectations - they do really solve things, not just post prepared answers - first time i had troubles registering, customer service gave me my serial number as it somehow couldn't arrive via email and second time i got a straight forward answer for my question in about 30 sec (about switching devices, which they allow freely - as opposed to what i was afraid of (losing one of my licenses)). Truly best customer service i ever had a chance to use."
Bill Rowe,1,5,"Don't waste time looking around, just get Bitdefender. You might find something as good, but not better, and the customer service will not be beat."
Bill Douglas,3,1,"I was running Bitdefender Total Security 2016, without any problems. I got a popup from them two days ago, telling me I could upgrade to the 2017 version for free. So I did it, and it crashed my computer. The problem was that when I installed the 2017, it uninstalled the 2016 program. I have been trying to work with them, in vain, as they refuse to let me have the 2016 program back, and refuse to give me a refund on the 2016 program-I have 8 months left on the yearly subscription.I have seen other who have had the same problem, so I would advise you not to use Bitdefender, cause once they have your money, they don't care whether it works or not, and it is their company policy to never give refunds."

Jon F,7,1,"Short version.  Software is ok to good.  Customer care sucks!  You will go round and round with no resolution to your issue.Long Version.  I have owned bitdefender products for many years.  I, like you, considered that Bitdeneder was a good product and thought that if anything when wrong, considering all the good reviews of bitdefender, that thes guys would do their best and help me.SO WRONG!I happened to change my subscription from the Family pack to the Multi pack, paid my money and initally all was fine.  Then a couple of weeks later I get billed for another Family Pack subscription.  OK, so all I need do is contact bitdefender and get my money back for the second, unwated product.  I submitted a ticket and a week/10 days later I got my money back.This is where the main issue statred.  When Bitdefender cancelled my Family pack subscription they also seem to have cancelled my Multi pack subscription.  I have spent my nights on the on-line chat talking to various people none of which can tell me when my issue will be sorted, in fact it took 2 sessions to get them to agree there was an issue.  I got lots of standard replies be no resolutions.  I've just been chatting to them again to night and still no date of when this will be fixed.There is a very simple solution to this - just give me a new code - sorted.  Why should I be made to wait days or weeks for you to sort out out what went wrong?  All I want is the product I paid for and you have not supplied."
Burak Diler,1,5,"The customer service is doing great job.They solved my problem quickly.And they refunded my money.Thank you!My old message(solved)""I've been using bitdefender for 2 years.But this they did renew my subscription without my authorization .As soon as i saw email from avangate, i sent them some emails about refund but they didn't reply.Then i've spoke with live chat agent.They've created ticket for me but after 3 days, still there is no respond.I've used love you guys but the last incident broke my heart.I hope you fix it ASAP.If the customer service reading this my ticket number is 2016121114110001"""

After my purchase there was an option that I figured were instructions for installing and setting up the program (note: I still did not receive an email with my order invoice yet). However, clicking on the icon immediately charged me an additional $29.99USD. There should be a confirmation screen for this as I definitely do not want remote assistance to install this program. I'm still waiting for my refund request for this to be  processed as the phone lines are currently busy and I've yet to receive a callback.EDIT: My order ID is 55231015"
Leigh Jackson,1,5,Bitdefender contributes significantly to my online defenses. Thoroughly recommended.
Vivek Kumar Agrawal,1,5,I have been using bitdefender for a very long time now. Overall product is good as well as customer services. I have contacted bitdefender for a couple of times (i think) since I have been using it. I have got good responses / solution every time. Never needed to contact them more than once. Hope they continue with the same kind of services in future as well.
Levent Ozozturk,2,5,"All I need as a customer is trust, swift technical service, and a trade mark that knows know-how well than others...choose bitdefender with a blindfold among other brands without hesitating..."
FD07PAA,13,2,"I bought Bitdefender Antivirus and am very dissapointed that it can only be installed on a window... I did read the details before buying as I wanted it to cover my android also. I have just checked the emails that Bitdefender sends you on payment and it says, ""up to 3 devices"" no reference to Windows only. Just looking at the subscription email - no reference to Windows there either ... I feel I have been tricked. Once my subscription has run out I wont be renewing. Poor!"
Graebeard,1,5,"1 - Good reviews online2 - Product works very well catching all sorts of internet ""terrorist software"" (viruses, etc.)3 - Sometimes a little difficult to catch all the nuances of the software, and that's why ....4 - Customer Service is around. I think this is where it really shines. I've had some issues with my setups, so contacted Customer Service. Within an hour I received an acknowledgement email and Ticket Number. Within another couple of days, I received very detailed step-by-step instructions to address my problem, as well as a request to please update them as to outcome. In all three cases, using 2016 and 2017 versions of the software, their solutions worked.5 - For me, great Customer Service on top of a good product, makes this a winner."
Silencer Enforcer,1,5,"Fast performance, convenient interface.Products for both PC and Mobile devices.Polite and efficient customer service."
Leslie Morrow,1,5,Very good experience. The Bitdefender  people did a great job taking care of me. No problems at all. Service was great.
S.J,2,1,"Product is ok, but they are a very dodgy company and I'd avoid them.  The second year in a row that they have automatically renewed my Bitdefender subscription and taken money from my account without authorisation and despite numerous calls, emails and requests to unsubscribe. Their customer service sound very professional and then don't do anything until you chase again.  Still waiting for a refund that I requested a week ago, which was being handled as 'priority 10' - whatever that is. I have now reported them to Trading Standards.  Being based in Romania and since money goes via the US (so I was informed), they appear to think they can operate outside of the UK law.  The money left my bank the next day, so why does it take them weeks to refund?  Not only will I not use them again, but I will pursue this matter as I feel it's not acceptable for online companies thinking they are outside the law."
David King,1,5,"I did extensive research on competitive Internet Security Software before  purchasing Bitdefender. Over the years, I have also tried and tested several major brands. While some of them offer an adequate protectiveshield, Bitdefender in my opinion, offers  a distinct edge in both performance, convenience and  service. When assistance is required, you can be sure of a rapid response. I have already recommended Bitdefender to my friends and associates and have no reservation in giving them a five star rating"
Michael,1,5,Bitdefender Total Security is a great antivirus software. Their tech support is also great in resolving issues.
karthik,1,3,thanks for the refund but it took so many days. i waiting for my extension of subscription.
Susan Hanlon,2,1,Installed this software on my computer 4 days ago.  It changed my internet connection fron home to public.  Therefore preventing me from using the internet.  Did not find viruses & malware I knew I had. Called their support team numerous times over for days.  Each time they had me do things that would take time I would have to call back and get a nrw tech.  Today I finally told them I I was deleting their software and want a refund if they could not fix it this morning.  They said they would upgrade the problem and someone would email the solution.  This solution requires a connection to the internet which I cannot maintain while their software is running on my computer.  This shows me they don't understand my problem nor can they fix it.  Asked to speak to a supervisor they were in a mtg.  Requested a refund will take 24 to 48 hours.  All their employees seemed to be named Andrew.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SOFTWARE.
Steingrimur Kristinsson,2,5,I have used in my 18 years internet process
Sparkles1,6,1,"I have had bitdefender since 2011, mainly since it auto renews and up until now I have been too lazy to change it.  The 2016 installation process was awful and despite many calls and emails to customer service it took several weeks to get this installed on my computer.  I am currently trying to cancel my auto renewal subscription for 2017 as there is literally no option on my profile to do this.  I talked to a customer support agent online who told me that he could not action this request and it had to be escalated to the sales team - bizarre considering i'm not buying anything.  I also escalated my own request via email.  NEITHER OF THESE HAS BEEN ANSWERED TWO WEEKS ON.  This is wholly unacceptable for customer service, considering in both requests I made sure that Bitdefender was aware that if they did not action the request for cancellation I would make sure that the auto renewal charge was treated as fraudulent by my bank, and I would personally report them to authorities.  I therefore am left to assume that this company is actively trying to fraudulently take money from customers and would advise that no one ever takes a product from Bitdefender.  Absolutely awful experience, I would rate them negative if I could. One of my many ticket numbers Is 2016120220370002 and the bitdsfender team just tried to sell me a cheap subscription for $29 if anyone wants to know how cheap they will go, but still hasn't cancelled my order like I asked 3 weeks ago. (This operation is such a scam."
Reynaldo Lugo,1,5,Asked Support if changing name. after running PC back to factory specs would affect my program. They answered that name had to be changed with information on what to do.The Fix was easy to follow..
Mrs Shirley Cleveland,5,5,"I have had issues using Macafee and was advised by family member to use this service, had an issue setting up, I was contacted very quickly and was given all the information needed to resolve issue.I would recommend this company customer service wonderful."
Sandra Kennedy,2,4,I think the reason I am having problems is because when I bought BitDefender at the store and tried to download from a disk (?) it didn't work the way I thought it would. I called tech support and they with my permission took over and installed the program. In the end I wound up having 2 years of BitDefender instead of one. I'm not 100% sure if that's what happened. Later I tried to install on another computer and same thing happened. I had 2 years applied instead of one. Seems there needs to be a better way to resolve the issue of when buyer is unable to download successfully  from disk bought from store and when tech service goes in the computer and downloads the same program.
Ioana Costache,1,5,"It was a minor problem, but it took a couple of days to be sorted out. The Bitdefender team sent me regular updates to let me know what they were doing and how long it would take. Great support throughout."
Doug Greutman,1,5,Had a problem putting in the authorization code and bitdefender helped me through it with suggestions. They were right on and it worked. The correspondence took a couple of days but was ok. Very nice program I have had for years and does not bog my system at all and immediatly stops any malicious stuff or sites. Excellent program. Doug
xehpa25,2,1,"Firstly I want to say I want to say I loved the software when I first installed it in 2015. This year I wanted to upgrade to ""Total Security 2017"" from the 2016 version, my subscription was almost up and there was a really good deal that came my way it was $30.00 (cad not usd) for the 2017 platfrom, this was Oct 16th. I contacted customer support and was told the support team had to manipulate my subscription and someone would get back to me in 48hrs. They did get back to me over a week later and they told me they were still working on it, after several emails back and fourth explaining I was having issues with the link that was sent finally on Nov 1 I had Bitdefender up and running. I loved the new layout, and even look past the fact they charged my $40cad and not the $30 that was attached to the promotional email i received. Then I started to get ""mshta.exe error"", I couldn't do anything without this error popping up. However I didn't relate this error to Bitdefender. I spent 72hrs, clean install after clean install, system restore, etc.....and then I started to pay attention to when the error started to happen. Every time it started to happen after I reinstalled Bitdefender from central. I stopped using it, gave up on the software and gave up on the support team. I did try to reinstall a couple more times hoping my computer was just having a bad day and since I was trying out trial periods from other software companies I felt I didn't have much to loose and every time the same error after the install. So i decided to purchase another piece of software from a competitor, it was half the price and offered more (Norton). All I have asked from Bitdefender is to be refunded the $40 that I spent on a piece of Software I cannot use, it is now Dec 3rd. I have sent 3 emails asking for the name and contact for the manager of the support team and I still have not received a reply and the last email i sent was on Nov 29th and the last email I have received from them was Nov 24th. The last email i received from them, they asked me to create a support tag, there is no way I am going to reinstall Bitdefender just to generate a support tag. I don't think I was asking for very much when i asked to be refunded $40.00. I have never had such a terrible experience when dealing with a company, I am sure there are more amazing stories about the company then bad, unfortunately I am one of the bad and I have all the emails to this situation saved. Open ticket 2016110316410002I don't understand what exactly ""human error"" means.  Millions of people depend on this software to keep there private information safe, i am certainly not one of those millions anymore.  It took over a month, multiple emails and then posting a review.  It wasn't until after I posted the review of bitdefender that I received an email about my refund.  The refund still doesn't makeup for the amount of time I spent having to fix my computer after your software damaged, it doesn't make up for the lost time I spent trying to communicate or relieve some sort of communication back.  I am sure you are sorry, but as a company I am sure I am just another 1 our of ??? that has had an unpleasant .  experience.  But yea, your right I did receive an email 3 days ago regarding a refund."
Rachel,2,1,"Just like a previous reviewer experienced I purchased the 2017 subscription during the Cyber Monday Deals. I noticed after inputting my card info and submitted it had a page error ,and I refreshed it. I then had to re-enter all the info and submitted. I saw a pop-up that said thank you for your purchase. I thought It at least takes to you to a verification page before purchase. I went to my e-mail and noticed I have 2 invoices meaning I ended up purchasing the same thing twice in seconds.  I went to customer service chat several times  and they did nothing but saying Sales will deal with it and kept elevating my issue. NOW... it has been one week already!  Nothing has been resolved and they haven't refunded the 2nd purchase.  The latest customer service chat wouldn't give me a name and phone number of a manager I can contact to. Here is a sample:December 4, 2016, 8:34 am - Rachel : can I talk to a manager?December 4, 2016, 8:34 am - Hazem Hamoud : Only by phone unfortunately.December 4, 2016, 8:34 am - Rachel : ok what is the number?December 4, 2016, 8:34 am - Hazem Hamoud : United States: (+1) 954 414 9655, (+1) 954 281 4024December 4, 2016, 8:34 am - Rachel : who's number is this?>December 4, 2016, 8:34 am - Hazem Hamoud : For Bitdefender.December 4, 2016, 8:35 am - Rachel : or is this a toll fee number?>December 4, 2016, 8:36 am - Rachel : I like the name of a manager and number I can reachDecember 4, 2016, 8:36 am - Hazem Hamoud : Yes.December 4, 2016, 8:36 am - Hazem Hamoud : Unfortunately we do not have specific numbers for the manager.December 4, 2016, 8:37 am - Rachel : then this is no different than chatting hereDecember 4, 2016, 8:37 am - Hazem Hamoud : Thank you for choosing Bitdefender Chat Support! Do not hesitate to contact us if you need further assistance, as we are here 24/7. Have a great day!They just hang you up. Worst customer service ever. How hard is it to  refund an accidental purchase?"
Ian Morrison,3,5,"Immediate reply to my query, was able to add a 2017 subscription (at a bargain price) to my unexpired 2016 one."
Tony Meacham,1,5,I purchased this product but only for MAC very easy to use and probably the best one out there (but thats only my opinion) With all the online scams going on i feel more measured with this product on my MAC even though some say MAC's don't need Anti Virus Programes.
TR,14,2,"I contacted Bitdefender because someone had used my email address to sign up for an account. I tried to secure the account by resetting the password, but it never arrived (and yes, I checked my spam folder), so I went to online chat to try and resolve it there.Here are some gems from our chat:CSA: That email is not used on any account. So basically what's your request.Me: If it's not on any account, why did I just receive an email saying ""Welcome to Bitdefender You are almost done. To confirm your Bitdefender account, please click on the button below.""?CSA: Because you used the email to create an account. :)Me: No, I didn't create any accountMe: Can I speak to someone else please?CSA: No.CSA: If there isn't anything serious in your request, this chat session will end.Me: This is a serious request. I received an email from your company telling me that my email address was used to create an account.CSA: Indeed, and that's your issue. It's your account. If anyone is using it, it's your issue.A company that deals in cybersecurity gets a help request about a security issue within their own accounts, and instead of trying to resolve the issue, they treat it like a prank call? And then he goes from 'there's no account with this email address' to deciding that there is, without explanation?So after I convinced him that no, it was not an issue that I had to discuss with my email provider, but rather an issue with someone using my email address into their own system (again, this is a cybersecurity company?), we got back to the original point:Me: So can you please delete the account that was created using my email address?CSA: I'll forward a case to Sales.Me: Is there an email address I can contact them on directly?CSA: No they don't have a direct email.Me: I'm not sure why sales should handle this rather than support. Can you please explain?CSA: No I can't.CSA: It's not at your liberty to know whoever will process your case.Excuse me?(Also, it took me ten seconds on Google to find their direct email address.)UPDATE: I was contacted and, after a few emails which were initially confusing (as they primarily addressed resetting my password), I was sent a 'delete account' link, followed by a full explanatory email and an offer of service recovery. The follow-up customer service agents were entirely professional, which was good, so I'm happy to update this review."
Ali Al-rubaye,1,5,"what do you need from an antivirus ,or in my case a total security program? doesn't use too many resources? or handles the system efficiently ? or have zero impact on your system? or keep your pc safe from viruses ? if you answered yes and yes and yes and yes  then go and get a Bitdefender Total security 2017 as i did"
Tom,2,5,I have used a few antivirus related products and Bitdefender does the job well.It performs as it should and doesn't slow my system down.I have purchased this for my family.
Richard Voigt,1,4,"Very simple and easy to use product.But do not let that fool you, this app does the job it is supposed to do and it does it well."
Jan Těšínský,1,5,is for me an excellent company that I can trust 100%.
Dan,1,5,All other protection software should move over because there's a new sheriff in town and its name is Bitdefender.
AL,3,1,Terrible experience.  Continual crashes on win 7 Pro 64bit .  Support opened a ticket and never contacted me again.  Then opened another ticket when I kept sending crash reports but still no response or action.  I would like a refund so I can get a decent productI do not have n order number only an activation code.  I have lots of support emails saying we will do something but nothing happens.  Tried telephone but could not get throughDec 3  one 'ticket number' is 2016111605420001Dec 5  a reply finally telling me to update an NVIDIA driver.  Unfortunately I already have the latest driver.  No other response or offer of refund
Willie Wiley,1,5,Bitdefender works great when it is properly installed and streamlined to suit your needs. It is very user friendly and I love the modules sections that can be tailored to suite your needs. It also has kept my PC's clean and virus free for over 10 years. It is my #1 antivirus program choice.
bradbury,1,1,"I had a subscription with Avantgate Bitdefender for software license, I received an email regarding auto renewal for £53.95, auto renewal was by default.  I contacted their support through the software, notifying them I would not be paying £53.95 when i can purchase their software for £30.00 elsewhere.  I suggested they reduce the price or cancel the renewal. I have received no reply to date.5 days later I saw an ad for the software, with 70% discount, for £21. I purchased an activated the subscription through the software.I received an email saying renewal was still proceeding for £53.95. I followed a link to change this setting on their website user control panel. My login details did not work, I requested remember password and was directed to amend password. Attempted to login with the new details but they were not accepted. I tried creating an account with my email address but would jump back to sign in details each time. I then use Internet Explorer rather than firefox, in case of compatibility issues but had the same result.I contacted Avantgate through their software informing them that their website will not allow me access to the control panel to stop renewal as they havn't acknowledged my initial correspondence and failed to recognise my recent purchase. Once again I told them not to continue with renewal of software as it has been renewed cheaper.Few days later I received an email stating my renewal had been processed, payment of £53.95 had been taken. I immediately, went through the cancellation process demanding an immediate refund.I see the payment was taken through paypal and they have now added 365 days to my subscription which was already 365 days, now totals 720 days.  From my experience, I doubt they will action my many communications and by their action of adding another year to my subscription, it would seem they are a law unto themselves. As such, I have request Paypal refund  the £53.95 as soon as possible.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you want to help me, then you might want to respond to the requests for help through your softwares support tool.  Obviously that is not working and I cannot believe this is the medium we have to communicate through. Support ticket no: 2016112811340001 dated 25/11/16 (still unresolved). You have cancelled the subscription but you have not refunded me the £53.95 against order Order #55077835.Paypal refused to refund the money, so I am still waiting for you, 10 days.  Quick to take the money and cancel the subscription, slow to refund!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 3After having to provide evidence Paypal had refused to action a refund on my behave, I received the refund from Avantage on the 17th Dec.18th Dec, my existing subscription was cancelled, leaving me with no protection on my 3 computers.I am now waiting for a refund or my subscription re-instated.I hope for the sake of all other Bitdefender customers, my experience is an isolated case of incompetence.The saga continues....Chapter 4 - THE HALF JOBI have been instructed, to use the internet without any firewall,antivirus etc, to sign in to my account to provide a screenshot, so they can see the status of my account held on their systems.I see now why all my computers subscriptions have been deactivated. They replaced or altered my existing subscription, which changed the activation/license code required. When this was done, I should have been notified of the change and provided with the new activation code.Where is the process knowledge or diligence?  Each action or inaction has led to a subsequent problem for me.  I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, just need the activation code for my subscription, then maybe they might want to address the original issue that started the whole thing?"
S.m Zubair Deep,1,1,"All Exe file was delate, Too much bad Support..."
John Ward,8,5,Very good product that doesn't ask much from you. Just set up & go. Never interrupts me while I am on a gaming session. Very happy user.
Karen,43,5,I had some issues getting Bitdefender to install on my Mac. The support team eventually offered to log in to my machine to troubleshoot. Despite it taking a little while they remained patient and polite and fixed the issue. I am really impressed with their service.
Hans,37,4,"I spent a day with a supporter, who was not able to solve my problem.After a phonecall and facebook contact the problem was solved in very short time.The software is absolutely best in class - topclass on Windows and Android."
Tom Wojtaszczyk,2,3,"Product has been trouble free, but reaching a representative by phone is not possible. Resolving by e-mail is just as bad. They drag their feet !!  I found chat effective"
Yitty Leang,1,1,"I made the decision to to change over to Bitdefender from Avast . But during the purchasing process the internet page refreshed and asked me to re-enter details n etc. It turned out that Bitdefender charged me twice for different products. I tried not to use the activation codes provided and call the customer service to clarify/refund one of the product. i waited 15 mins to a customer service personnel who were extremely rude and condescending, making me feel like i am begging for my own money. And at the end of the day he said he will need to forward this another department for FURTHER process (email process)......I would hope a large and well-reputable company doesnt treat all their customers in this manner. I will certainly take this matter further if need be.Disappointed"
Ludovic V.,6,1,"Product is one of the best for mac.Service is the worst I ever encountered.Website to purchase too, full of problems.Nothing is working properly, 2 days to get my anti virus for mac activated, 2 payments done, and 2 hours talking on the chat.And Paypal refund done in 7 business days, because ""it's the legal length"" for something that could be done instantly. What a joke in 2016.Oh and putting a SSL Certificate Bitdefender SRL on the website bitdefender.fr which is owned by a reseller named Eptimum. Not really sure this is legal.Summary:Good luck to buy their products, pray for never have to be in contact with their customer service."
JF,6,2,"Bitdefender seems to be an excellent security product. However, when I was invited by email to renew early I was led through steps allowing me to choose which product I wanted to renew to. I renewed to Total Security 2017 having been on Internet Security 2015. Within Bitdefender Central this showed up fine. However I also double checked by logging in from within Internet Security 2015 on my PC. Here it showed me that my Internet Security subscription would not be extended, as expected, but instead the old and new would run concurrently for about 100 days.It struck me that customers doing this renewal process a little more quickly than me might not notice this and end up paying double for this overlap period. Under the circumstances of being invited to renew early it shouldn't be up to the customer to be so cautious about this kind of thing. It took me a considerable length of time to sort out - customer service were extremely helpful but it took about 3 or 4 days to get a response to each of my emails.In the end I did renew, though.EDIT FOLLOWING RESPONSE FROM BITDEFENDER: The response confirms my reservations. Either the link on my renewal email should have led just to a renewal for Internet Security, or if it was going to lead to a selection of Bitdefender products then all should have been actually available to me without my needing to be wary about Bitdefender double charging me. It looks bad that Bitdefender have things set up this way - probably other customers don't notice and do double pay. I have reduced my rating by one star since Bitdefender seem to think this renewal process is acceptable and give no indication of resolving it (admittedly it's not in their interests to do so)."
Charles Wehr,4,5,I have bought Bitdefender software for about 2 years and customer service and software are great.
Blank,1,1,"Just as the title says.. They take your money and give you NO activation code. They send you a confirmation email stating that they have received payment from you and that's as far as it goes, you WILL NOT have service with Bitdefender.I have opened a support ticket via email and they have failed to respond, so I opened a live chat with technical support, and without even asking for my order number the representative told me they see my order is in process and would receive an email when completed (keep in mind it's been about 5 hours after they have received my money via PayPal). It's been over 24 hours now and STILL no activation code!!! So I am extremely frustrated at this point and so I opened another live chat with technical support only this time the representative asked for my order number, so I gave it, and he told me the same thing, that my order is still being processed. I asked him ""PayPal has already confirmed that you guys have my money, shouldn't I receive what I have payed for when I pay for it?"", he then tells me he is going to elevate the problem to the sales department, they will contact me via email, and then finally tells me that this is a known issue due to having so many orders on their website...... Shouldn't a Antivirus/Anti-Malware company of this caliber have a website that can process orders immediately???? I am so disappointed. DO NOT give them your money, I will seek a refund via PayPal, F*#$ this company."
Mr george loudon,4,5,one of the best antivirus you can buy
Jim,1,4,"Bitdefender sent me a ""special offer"" before my 2016 subscription ran out. it was like half off so I took it. I ended up with a gutted version of 2017 bitdefender  it does not have all the features of my 2016 version and if I want the missing feature I have to pay more...WHATEVER... oh and the sneaky hard to see kind of grayed out  auto renew opt in or out button is very Classy... after review I found I ordered..for last year 2016 ...Bitdefender Total Security 2016 3 Devices / 1 Year.its came with a feature I used a lot called ""one click optimizer "" for 2017 I ordered....Bitdefender InternetSecurity 2017 3 Devices / 1 Year (does not come with one ""one click optimizer"") for what ever reason. I guess i should have ordered Bitdefender Total SecurityMulti-Device 2017 5 Devices / 1 Year ,  But I don't need multi device All I have  is PC  includes the one click optimizer (My bad I guess) Now I get prompted to upgrade to Total Security for 39 bucks.  I tell you these marketing geeks really know how to muck things up"
Trevor Simpson,3,5,"I have used Bitdefender Internet Security since 2015 and I can honestly say that it is the best product on the market. Each year a new and better version is launched which continues to make Bitdefender increasingly ""silent"" and ever more trustworthy. Bitdefender Safepay  is now the only product I trust to protect my financial transactions."
Mr Stephen Williams,9,5,"I've used several Antiviral providers in the past and Bitdefender stands out from the rest in being user friendly, professional, and a great customer service."
Adam Blank,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for more than 3 years now. I've recommended it and installed it on all my loved ones' machines. Their operating systems range from Windows XP, through Windows 7 and 8.1, to Windows 10. I love the online dashboard functionality. Despite slight ambiguity of names and their annual changes, I always know current state of my subscriptions and my machines."
Dale McKee,1,5,I was very satisfied when customer service sent me the activation code that was supposed to be in an email Bitdefender originally sent to me when I purchased the 2017 software. When I checked the email it was a receipt for my purchase but no activation code was in it. It did take an extra day or two to respond back to me with the activation code.  Everything else went extremely smooth.  From download to installation.  I like Bitdefender a lot!
Me,21,5,Fantastic backroom support compliments a superb product.
Theodore Charles,2,5,I would highly recommend using this product on your Windows Computer.
Nicholas Wilcox,1,5,"As an ex-Norton User, Bitdefender has shown me how Antivirus software should be. Now that I've seen the light, I'm never going back!"
Wael Moussa,1,5,"I like Bitdefender Total Security, include many serves, the computer stay fast with bitdefender.Also the wallet it is easier of KeePass."
Josh Miller,1,5,"Had issues with special offer and sent a quick comment, they fixed everything quickly and made life easy, program works well and is pretty smooth for operation"
Ken Gaither,2,4,I wished they had told me I could turn off auto renewal. I had paid but was still getting messages about my expiration date.
Ryan432120,2,5,"I had an issue that i accidentally purchased a service that was not useful to me, and Diana From Bitdefender took good care of my issue.I'm very happy, and grateful... Thank You again Diana."
Dan Souder,1,5,"Great product, best on the market in my opinion. An invisible wall that just works. No speed issues with such a strong anti-virus protection. Don't even notice it's there, it just works flawlessly in the background. Well worth the cost. Thank you."
Vic Parrish,1,5,Contacted Bitdefender about subscription issue after 2017 renewal.  Response was timely and customer focused.  My issue was resolved quickly and completely.  Great job Bitdefender!
frigginfast,2,5,Wow ! It has been a long time since I have experienced on more than one occasion where a company actually delivers in their promise. For me Bitdefender has done it 3 times in a row over a period of 18 months.If your after a highly effective anti virus software with the backup you need - install Bitdefender
NK191KOEE,1,5,Not as amazing as advertised but you can get a pretty good deal and it does it's job.
Rowan Hearne,1,5,I'm a uni student and don't pay for bitdefender antivirus. I reckon bitdefender is what I need for a trustworthy antivirus software.
Lorna Loughridge,1,5,"we lost our updated email for bitdefender so activation was impossible. It took a few days but a new activation was sent to us . All Good ,we love the product ,so far best security we.ve had for our computers to date."
Akshansh1,1,4,I had an issue with my account renewal.The BitDefender team promptly took it up and resolved my issue. A small suggestion: please include live chat support if possible.
Hellster Nash,1,4,better go with the latest versions. You'll find comforting
Brian,4,4,"there appeared to be a difference between Bitdefender uk and Bitdefender central however once a response was received, the problem was fixed quickly.Suggest you do not leave ''activate now'' on a program that has already been activated and approved. Apart from that, the service and response is very good. Will keep using the company.bh"
Subrata Banerjee,1,5,"I had an issue to register an android device to the multi devices product. It accepts 4 devices but 5th one! I reached to customer care by creating service ticket which was getting delayed to provide the solution. Hence, tried to chat with customer care personnel which was really very prompt!Customer care personnel had created new ticket and resolved it within 24 hours which is much appreciable. As a customer, our expectation is to get resolution at earliest and realtime, especially for antivirus software. Which Bitdefender did to convert me a happy customer! :)"
Lorenz,1,5,Customer service is great
Douglas McBride,1,5,"My experience with Bitdefender has all been great. They solved my problem in good time, and I am confident that the software protects my system efficiently. I will always recommend Bitdefender to my friends."
philip hutchison,1,5,"First installation of Bit defender was effortless but after a storm brought down a tree and crashed my system I had to install a new windows 10 64and I lost my activation code and passwords, that was a day ago, now I am up and running again with the best internet security system I have ever come across, Bit Defender is fantastic."
Vineeth Kumar,1,5,"The free version itself is mostly enough for regular users. It doesn't tell you to pay, ever. It will never ask to scan, as it is always scanning in the background for you. It is efficient in removing threats and not making a big fuss about it, never pops up unless it requires your attention.The service is also great even for free users. I had to only contact them once so far, and it was a breeze to get in contact.All in all, it is a very solid product with very little impact on your system, and a lot of impact on your PC's protection."
Jean-Guy Belisle,1,5,"I already wrote it in French in the preceding survey. Thanks a lot to one of your assistant Marian with whom I could chat and SHE helped me to settle the problem I had: Install Bitdefender Internet Security 2016 on my second laptop. It was two days ago or three...November 3 or November 2. My two laptops function very well with Bitdefender right now. Thanks to whom it may concern and especially to Miss Marian.P.S.- Yesterday (November 4 2016), I had to upgrade Windows 10 and now they keep telling me that I have to use Windows Defender, which I don't want. They even told me to eliminate Bitdefender and use Windows Defender instead. The only thing I can do at the moment is to ``disactivate`` their antivirus that comes with Windows 10. Is there a way to eliminate their ``antivirus`` or I have to live with it?Anyway, it is ``disactivated`` and, one thing for sure, I am not going to use it. I wish I knew your feeling and reccomendation  about that.Your advice would be really appreciated."
Tarik,1,5,In recent years Bitdefender has been 100% successful in security tests.I am using Bitdefender Total Security on my 3 computers.I would recommend friendships.
Tony,2,1,"I am having a shocking experience with this company. They contacted me twice to gain my approval for renewing my annual subscription.  After I did not respond, they just took $129.00 out of my account without my consent. Not only is this amount almost twice as high as I have previous paid, I am having significant difficulties trying to get a refund.  I contacted them straight after I found the funds go missing and never activated the software.  Still I am being told that they have to console and make a verdict on if I can get my money back.  It has been weeks.  I have never heard of a company acting this way.  I will never do business with them again. I would recommend anyone discontinuing there service watch out for them just to take the money out of your account anyway.  I would not recommend anyone doing business with a company such as this that act with such low regard to its clients.  I am very disappointed."
Király V. István,3,5,i USE FROM MANY YEARS BITDEFENDER ! AND MY COMPUTER AND MY DOCUMENTS IT'S TRUSTED SECURED BY IT!
Stephen Paul,7,5,Great Service every time!
Majid Ir,1,1,This company charges your credit without permission and does not return your money despite their claim.
Don Chalmers,2,5,"I can honestly say that as far as my opinion goes Bitdefender and their support team are the ""Best of the Best"".101%, From  Trek-Don."
Miguel Sanchez-Monge,2,5,Will highly recommended all bitdefender products to friends and family.
Rod,8,5,I have been using Bitdefender for over two years now. It just does its job with the minimum of fuss and with no noticeable impact to my system. So refreshing after experiences with the other market leaders! What makes the real difference is that on the occasions I have needed advice or support I have been able to contact Bitdefender and receive prompt free and effective assistance. For my money it has everything I need and is head and  shoulders ahead of the competition.
Local Walker,7,3,"Bitdefender seems to offer technically good security software but the user interface leaves a lot to be desired. I would never recommend it to any of my non-technically minded friends. For example, it includes ransomeware protection, but I still do not know for certain, and cannot tell from the control panel, whether this protection is currently working on my system; maybe it is, maybe it isn't, who knows? All I know is that the software does contain this protection and overall seems to be doing what it is supposed to be doing."
Minkyu Song,1,5,"I lost my laptop when before exam week.So I can't stand my mind. Get Depressive.Ask MS, Lenovo, etc how I can trace lost laptop. They don't support me. Appropriately. But Bitdefender is an only useful information source for me.Thanks a lot Bitdefender support-center"
Harry Rundall,1,5,"For the last 2 years, as a Bitdefender customer, I've been using their Total Security product with complete satisfaction.  Those rare times I needed to contact their customer service department I found them engaged with my required needs to solve what issues experienced with their products.  This always resulted in a solution to those issues.Anyone considering a new Virsus/security product would be best served with Bitdefender as their number one selection.  I am certainly satisfied."
Robert Pires,1,5,"I was always used to Free antivirus softwares on the internet and I never thought I would go ahead and buy a paid antivirus software until my friend introduced me to BitDefender and I can honestly say that my life has never been the same (in a positive way). I have been using BitDefender for a few years now and I have never had any issues or glitches with the application and on the few occasions that I was troubled by something, I wrote an email to the BitDefender support staff and my emails and queries were promptly answered and my problems were resolved in a few days. I was so busy with work and things that I didnt get the time to resolve the issue but BitDefender kept on sending me emails to resolve the issue and I finally did and I am really glad that I have chosen the perfect AntiVirus software which comes with the best support staff you can get. Thanks once again to the BitDefender support team"
Newsom Shows,1,5,"I've never had a better experience with a support team, they were determined to solve my problem, regardless of cost.Thank You Bitdefender."
Gene McCausland,1,5,Resolved my problem within 24 hrs. Only required one e-mail and the sending of a report of the failure generated via a monitoring program that recorded what transpired when Bit Defender failed to install.
Gregory Beaumont,1,5,I needed help on a problem I had with the serviceI contacted the support group online and in no time I was up and going From a problem I thought was unresolved to up and running with no hard effort Thanks again for the help at BD
Макс Ковалев,1,5,"Very carefully resolving all questions, super product! Keep it up!))))"
Erik,10,5,Super all the way

KhaLeD AlNajDi,1,5,"I Use Many Security Program From I started My Internet Life since 1998 ,I Say That Because Really ""BitDefender Total Security 2017"" is Revolution In The Security Level ,Not Only That ..!!They Have Better And Faster Support Team ...Finaly, Try ""BD TS 2017"" And Please Comment Here To Help Many User's ..."
Tomáš Suľovský,1,5,"Really cheap for all tools and modules, high performenc and security level.I use Bitdefender total security for about 5 years and it never let me down :)5 stars for their Customer Care :)"
Joseph Mathews,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender since the last 6 years and have never felt the need to even try another Total Security software. They have excellent detection systems and immediate solutions for any problem you face (though there will never be). An excellent interface and a effective program. A MUST HAVE for all.
Chrys Aureus,1,5,"I was a long time (abt 10 years) user of a popular antivirus which has dominated the market issuing a quite effective free version.  Last year after a substantial update, this a/virus became too heavy and taxing for my old trusty laptop. It continually hogged CPU (more than 50%) and RAM resources and the machine would run much hotter than usual. I contacted several times their customer services on this issue but the replies were generically vague, exploratory and not individually targeted. After searching the web I discovered that I was not the only one with this problem as too many customers were complaining on this same issue. Fortunately,in one chat room someone recommended Bitdefender for its light footprint on PC resources and without compromising effectiveness.I downloaded the trial version for a spin, and have never looked back..."
Alexander;,28,5,"Whilst I did have some trouble with getting the wallet section of the 2017 version of the product to work, the company responded well and fixed the problem by remotely connecting to my machine and finding the cause of the issue.The product itself is solid and works well for a great price"
S Johnsen,1,1,"I like the program, but there is absolutely NO CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've written several times and never received a response"
hocine,1,5,"Amazing software, very easy to use, cheaper, and its not heavy if you have low ram, so its very nice."
Jim Adams,1,4,"I have been pleased with the performance of the product. As to customer service support, I needed to contact customer service after responding to an early renewing offer. There was confusion regarding the expiration date, but after some back in forth it was resolved to my complete satisfaction."
Galin,1,1,"I am having troubles with a refund I requested immediately after I purchased BItdefender a few days ago. I received two invoices. One for the subscription I wanted and another one for Install & SetUp service I never ordered. The crooks from Bitdefender stole $ 39.47 from my credit card. I Sent several e-mails and phoned twice but nothing happened so far.Scary to see how many people were robbed so far. They can take money from your credit card any time they want. They steel through PayPal, they can even use your expired credit card.This product might be ok, but it doesn't worth such a headacheHere is my update.You say you guarantee 30 days money back.I didn't activate the product and I am not going to use your services neither. I ask you to return my money for both ID 54019807 and ID 53652774!RegardsUpdate:Confirm that money is back.Thanks"
Bert Pollheimer,5,5,"Bought this for my Macbook. Smooth job in the background. Purchase was a little clunky, so ended up paying twice. Refund requested and given quickly and smoothly."
Ted Knudtson,1,5,"I've had Bitdefender for several years now and truly trust it. Un-complicated to install and set up and the ""Auto Pilot"" selection will automatically monitor your security. Even years ago it didn't slow things down the way other programs did. It warns me when I need to be warned and quietly takes care of the rest behind the scenes. Ok, I LOVE it!"
Mihai Dan Mustea,7,5,"I had probably the best customer care experience ever. The team behind Bitdefender is amazing. Thank you!On the other hand, I used many antivirus products in the past two decades. For now, this is the best product I could use. Very light and responsive."
charlie R,1,5,"Bitdefender Total Security, excellent product, excellent support. I would easily recommend Bitdefender."
Roshan Hegde,1,5,"Very good Antivirus for MAC.Customer support reply took around 2 to 3 days, they need to improve   to get back answer on same day or within one day.I like bitdefender so much even i recommended my friends to install it and they installed it, they are very happy now.Bitdefender, please improve Antivirus for MAC by considering Future stuff same as what you have for Windows.Waiting for your reply..Thank you Bitdefender team for great support.."
Julian Snowden,1,2,"The agent that I spoke with was almost impossible to understand. They really need to hire people that have a better command of the English language.  To make matters worse, I was put on hold for almost 40 minutes, before I gave up.  Love the product, but the customer service is basically useless."
Kerry Coates,2,5,"This is not Microsoft, when I needed help B,itdefender was there for me and solved my issue immediately."
Edwinava Yohn G Chee,2,5,"Dear Bitdefender helpdesk, I am impressed with the accurate instruciton given when I needed to RDP (MSTSC) from outside my home to my laptop at home. I am now able to do it without problem. Thanks for providing accurate instruction. Well done Bitdendender. Especially to your team member , Daniela Zdravkovska.Blessings & Best Regards,Edwinava Yohn Job David J"
Jeffrey,2,5,"Since purchasing Bitdefender last year, I've had no security issues after the installation, the fact you can upgrade to next years version after owning the previous at no extra cost is amazing. The only hiccups I've had were a computer that was unable to install a certain version, after allowing Bitdefender to remote in and take analysis data, they solved the problem, added it to a patch and extended my subscription by a few months for helping. I recently resubscribed as my year was almost up, they combined my new subscription with my old to gain the extra months I had left, I was then able to upgrade again at no cost to the current years version."
Yatharth Anand,1,5,"Anyone could be at number 1 spot but staying there for years together need constant hunger for excellence and happy customers.This is what defines Bitdefender.Really awesome product with customer support that's really awesome too.Would recommend this product for all, particularly those who are concerned about cyber safety and safety of loved ones."
hamid reza rahmatollahi,1,5,"First of all i should say that it is really the best over others.I have bought the license but it does working, i have contact bitdefender support they fixed it in 6 hours after purchase confirmation"
Winoc Simoens,1,5,Bitdefender is as a Porsche car because it is the fastest and most reliable internet security software without slowing down the work speed of your computer. Earlier experiences with Norton were very bad: really slowing down the computer speed and not stopping a lot of malware and viruses.
Bob Burrell,6,5,We had been using another Internet security solution but thought the renewal fee for loyal customer was excessive so looked at what was available. Bitdefender had a wonderful offer on their Total Security product and for the price of 3 machines we thought it was worth a try. The installation was smooth and faultless. The protection offered far outperformed our previous package in terms of features and memory overhead. With Bitdefender installed it just lets you get on without nagging or messing with your daily use. We are thrilled and glad we put our trust in Bitdefender Total Security.
Chris Perrott,11,1,"I responded to an e-mail on 7/19/16  and took up the offer to purchase Total security Multi Device 2016 for £29.99.I have a receipt for that amount for the product ordered stating it is ""for up to 5 devices - 1year""  dated 7/10/16 (Order I/d 53542480)The e-mail instructions for installation of the product were followed to the letter and a Bitdefender account set up.the programme installed easily and worked correctly on the 1st PC and then the problems started. I was advised on loading onto the 2nd PC that my quota was used  1 of 1. On checking I found that my subscription was for 1 device and that I had 245 days left!I contacted Bitdefender and got a ticket and a promise!On 10/10/16 I tried the chat line but gave up  when I failed to find any means of forwarding my message like a SEND button. As a result I  received new ticket! (20165101015490002)On receiving this I sent an e-mail giving details of what had happened (or not!) since placing the order with the hope that it would speed up a resolution to the sorry mess..The product may be good but support and communication are rubbish and needs a close examination. I would NOT recommend. Still no news (12/10/16) and I contacted company to CANCEL and arrange a REFUND. Of course I have been sent  another new Ticket- it is the one thing the customer can rely on from communicating with Bitdefender13/10/61    Reply received  with explanation and probable solution . Sorry to say its too late  my request for cancellation and refund will be pursued"
Pam Mcmahon,1,5,I emailed and had autoreply straight away & in no time at all a detailed email advising us on how to proceed. We have Bitdefender on windows 7 desktop plus Windows 10 desktop ( where we were experiencing problem) also mobile phone & tablet. Our problem was solved by updating Bitdefender for windows 10. So we are very very happy. Spreading the word to all our friends.
Paul Dickerson,3,5,"Upgraded from Internet Security 2015 to 2017 requiring uninstall of 2015 and install of 2017. Limited functionality of email and internet (to name a few) afterwards due to ""entry point"" and "".dll"" conflict issues. Managed to contact Support Centre despite this and they were excellent and offered solutions. It resolved perfectly and fingers crossed (three days later) all appears OK."
Gienek,1,5,"Customer support was knowledgeable, polite and took care of my install issue in a very timely manner, ...definitely 5 stars all the way."
Brentpot Läbb,1,4,"I tried out the 2017 total security version w/ 90 days trials, excellent performance but the 2017's get my mother in laws net book laggy or cause to slow down. So i contacted support & they recommended me to install the 2015 version. Works decently now. Customer service was helpful & friendly. My Mother in law said she will buy out the 2015 version once the trial expires."
Valued Customer,6,5,"Once past any installation anomalies, the software works well.  Customer service has been good with me and they are pretty efficient."
Clive Tompkinson,7,5,When upgrading to the latest version of the product I experienced a licencing issue. I contacted the customer support team who responded to my request very promptly and my issue was rectified after three emails. Very happy with this level of service.Clive Tompkinson
Gen Williamson,5,5,Customer service is top notch and product itself is amazing
Daren Pegg,8,1,"Purchased 3 year licence in 2015 but it would not work on older Vista running laptop. Also they withdrew the parental monitoring systems two weeks after purchased, customer services, when yo actually manage to reach someone are condescending and rude. So asked for a full refund. Now I keep getting email from Bitdefender saying my licence is due to expire and I need to renew the licence, four emails sent asking them to stop but renewal notice but so far several weeks later still getting the emails."
Pedro Prata Santos,1,5,Use Bitdefender for more than 2 years! since then that i´m feeling safe about my system like never before!Do really think Bitdefender is the best protection ever!
Richard Howarth,3,5,"I have been using the antivirus for mac product for some time. It works well and without interrupting other activity. I recently contacted bitdefender to add another licence - no problem, handled very efficiently. Installed the latest version and had a problem with the installation on one machine. This was dealt with promptly and with great courtesy and I am now fully protected again. A great product and a great company I have no hesitation in recommending."
Graeme Smith,1,5,"Bitdefender Total Security is an excellent product backed up with exceptional support, I would highly recommend Bitdefender to any potential customer looking for the best allround computer security."
Margie Webster,1,5,I have used Bitdefender now for 3 years. Bitdefender has blocked many different viruses and  malware for me.  I have called customer service different  times and had good results with them.  I would recommend  Bitdefender to anyone with no questions ask.
Dirk Petersen,19,4,"Payed until end of year, but could not reinstall their Internet Securty on my PC. Solved by installing Kasperskys. Three stars as it runs on my android devices.10/10 2016:I used Kasperskys for free one month and paid 17 Euro to protect 3 PCs one year, and this free month make me familiar with Kasperskys, a big plus is that it is easy to adjust Kasperskys, so it not stop my bots running. Bitdefender is fine too, but failed to reinstall on my w7 pro pc as I used ""Schutz intallieren"" from central.bitdefender.com /devices. Bitdefender also crashed my pc meanwhile playing with bots. I needed to reinstall, as I had forgot my password for my bitdefender on my pc, so I could allow the bot to run.I have still bitdefender running on six other devices, one of them a notebook. My online order for bitdefender on pcs is/was 44187370. I am using the same name for my bitdefender account as for trustpilot."
Luciano Goulart,1,5,"BitDefender Gravity Zone it's an excellent product to combat any type of malware with high level of detection with a wonderful performance. The product also offers features like Device Control, Content Control, Firewall, IDS and IPS, mode power user, application control, privacy control and other features help the network administrators. The management console is based on cloud and are very intuitive and easy to use. The support service is absolutely amazing and responsive."
nortH360,1,5,Every question i had was answered in less than 24hrs. A follow up email was also received from Bitdefender. These guys are known for being the best rated and it shows!
Nazar Nazzarino,1,5,Definitely recommend . Excellent protection for many years.
Anne Joyce,1,5,Got this through Geek squad.... Next time I go direct to BitdefenderThe customer service follow up was excellent....still waiting to hear back from the geeks......
Dimosthenis Isigonis,1,4,"So when you have a request or a problem , contact with the custome services and they will get back to you with the solution . Easy as that !!!"
Mike H,10,1,"I bought BitDefender Plus for Mac a couple of days ago.  I'd originally intended to download the 30-day trial but on the point of downloading I was offered a discounted two-year subscription if I signed-up straight away.  It was a bit too tempting, so I took the offer rather than taking the 30-day free-trial.  BIG MISTAKE!BitDefender is one of those organisations that puts selling above everything else.  The result was that after signing-up, rather than being taken to downloading and installation instructions, I arrived on a page dedicated to selling me an add-on product that I didn't want.Due to the complete absence of installation instructions at what would have been the ideal place to provide them, I made some natural assumptions about how to install the product - assumptions that, it turned out, were wrong.After a bit of digging I eventually found that BitDefender can only be installed from within BitDefender Central.  Why not make this clear at the time of purchase, rather than trying to sell me extra products that I don't want?However, my various attempts at installing BitDefender resulted in BitDefender Central being confused over the status of my account.  I couldn't create an account (it told me that an account already existed) but It wouldn't let me access my details.  Consequently, I wasn't able to install the product at all.I raised an email support ticket (not sure how!) and, to be fair, the problem was resolved a few hours later.  I could then install BitDefender.The whole installation process is poorly documented and counter-intuitive.  BitDefender say that BitDefender Central is necessary in order to allow the proper management of subscriptions, etc, but all it does is make the installation process a mess - especially as BitDefender don't even provide appropriate installation instruction when they’re needed.But eventually, I got it installed and working.Then I discovered what seems to be a bug in the Web Protection part of the product.  I tried to raise a support ticket online, but failed.  The web form requires various details, one of which is the ""licence key"".  Unfortunately, BitDefender, having switched to a subscription model, no longer use licence keys for their latest products.  Of course, without a licence key it isn't possible to create a support ticket, so I'm unable to report the bug.This is SO FRUSTRATING.  The BitDefender product may be good - I don't yet know - but the rest is AWFUL:-Poor documentationA website that just wants to sell, sell, sell...A messy installation processBitDefender Central - why does it even existConfusing product names to the extent that I'm not sure what I now haveInability to create support tickets without a non-existent licence keyetc, etc, etcMy strong impression so far is that BitDefender may be a good and effective product, but it is seriously let down by the way in which BitDefender sells and supports it.Meanwhile, I still have what appears to be a bug in the Web Protection feature, and I can't even report it.If you're considering BitDefender don't get suckered-in by the ""one-time"" offers of discounted subscriptions if you buy it straight away.  Say NO, NO, NO, and TAKE THE 30-DAY FREE TRIAL.  Find out what you're getting in to BEFORE parting with your cash."
Rares Andrei Matei,1,3,"I have acquired a pack of 4 licenses of Internet Security 2016 and wanted to split them between 2 accounts (my sister's and mine).I created a ticket (2016091221010003) on their online platform, offered the subscription code, bill and the purchase order, with as many details as possible.I waited 4 days without an answer, I called customer support. Obviously, I had to explain the situation again, although I provided the ticket #. They told me that it is was assigned to a technician that will contact me asap.I waited another 3 days (without any response whatsoever) and then I called again. I was assured that my request was escalated, I confirmed that I want the licenses equally split between the 2 accounts and I was reassured that it will be done in a maximum of 2 days.In the 10th day since I opened the ticket, I received an email where I was asked to provide (again) the purchase order, bill and subscription code and was asked (for the 3rd time) how would I prefer the licenses to be split between the 2 accounts.In the 11th day I received an email that stated it cannot be done. Period.I asked twice via email to receive a feedback email to rate my experience and, of course, I didn't receive anything.WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!The situation was finally resolved."
Diogenese,1,1,"Complaints about Bitdefender's marketing are easy to find, and for good reason.  They will auto renew your subscription even after you uninstall the software and make it plain that you want to end your subscription.  The user interface is streamlined but unintuitive, difficult to figure out how to do what you want, and takes too many steps to get there.  Their deceptive auto renew scam is reason alone to avoid the product."
Mike Ag,1,4,"Good customer service, but with several communication misunderstandings. In all, Diana Toader, CS Representative, took the time with back and forth email communication, and with patience had mutual understanding of the problem and the solution; which was carried well."
John,5,5,Based on my previous experience with other supposedly similar products Bitdefender is far superior - in the protection given; in the lower demands made on the system and also in the quality of the technical service given if/when needed.
Peter Posetti,2,5,Terrific product with a great user interface. Support staff are excellent.
Ana-Maria Munteanu,1,5,"Problems with this product were rare, anyway their solving indications from the support team came rapidjy and were not difficult to understand."
Alyx Ezakiya,1,1,"I contacted Avangate on the 10/09/16 as they had withdrawn payment from my paypal account. I explained i did not wish to renewal the contract and i requested a full refund. They sent me a Refund Request on the same day which i only responded to on the 13/09/16 via e-mail.I then contacted Bitdefender on 13/09/16 and was told verbally that payment would be received in 48 hours once processed, They sent me the Refund Request on the 16/09/16 only making me an offer for an extra 6 months added onto the 2 years package i did not consent too in the first place they then sent me two reminders on the 17/09/16 and 18/09/16 cause they didn't hear back from me on the 16/09/16, however i wasn't aware or told that i would receive a reply via e-mail as all i wanted was cancellation of the renewal and a refund. Today i have called them again only to be told the colleague who is taking this case cannot ring me and will only contact me via e-mail although i was not informed when this would happen. The person ispoke too said she could not give me a time-scale of when my refund would be made but then ended the conversation by saying it could take 7 to 10 days which wasn't very helpful just made the matter more misleading. I feel they are very quick to take people's money without their consent but not quick enough at refunding which seems absurd as i have checked previous replies from Bitdefender which states as in Karlene's case.@BitdefenderThe request you have described (a refund for an auto-renewal charge) is something that is handled very easily and quickly. We stand firmly by our refund policy and there is no reason whatsoever for anyone to delay or deny such a request.If this statement is true Bitdefender then why am i still waiting and why have you got so many bad reviews.."
Peter Ferguson-Mccardle,4,5,"Wow, it's about time I found a virus protection that is so interactive. Well done you guys!"
Trevor Camp,1,5,Easy to use and great support
Mark Notte,1,5,Bitdefender's Customer Care is very proactive and efficient.  They were able to look beyond the reason for my initial contact with them and demonstrated a thorough appreciation of my business in doing so.
John Haenen,1,5,"This product is user-friendly, non-invasive and seemingly very effective. There are a couple of shortcomings though:- sometimes a virus scanner needs to be disabled for another programme to run; there is no simple way to temporarily switch off Bitdefender- the install operation (especially for licence renewals, but also for updates) needs to be optimized. Re-installing the entire database instead of just updating the parts that need to be updated is hugely time-consuming, especially if you have a slow data connection"
Bob Frump,3,1,I subscribed.  Paid for a year.  Bidefender says my subscription has expired one month after. IMPOSSIBLE to get to customer service and no action by the billing agency.  Horrible customer service.
Alethia Haryanti,1,5,I've used BitDefender for over 5 years and I must say this journey has been the smoothest of all anti-virus software's I have had in my life. Having tried at least 5 (Paid) Anti-Virus Software's and I must say BitDefender easily overcomes the rest. ✓ Security ✓ Speed ✓ UX & UI ✓ Price I have not gone back to any other and will always recommend this product. Thanks BitDefender.
KJ,2,5,Excellent customer service...and above all promptly accomplished...
Willie Wiley,1,5,Bitdefender is an excellent antivirus program. I have used Bitdefender since 2006. It is mostly a self driving antivirus program that requires little to no customer intervention. It is very intuitive in nature and does not negatively impact system performance. I would recommend this antivirus program to anyone seeking an antivirus solution.
Al Parker,1,5,I can't speak to how well Bitdefender does its intended job because I haven't had it long enough. You can consult the experts about that. However I did have a problem (my fault as near as I can tell) which required their technical assistance. Their staff was unfailingly polite and helpful. They worked back and forth with me on the problem until it was resolved. Excellent customer service.
Faisal M.,1,5,"I really LOVE the small RAM/CPU foot-print BD takes up and its no-user interaction approach is Fabulous, to say the least..I don't know how anyone can choose an AV other than Bitdefender at the moment.. I have been an IT enthusiast for close to 20yrs and have yet to encounter a better AV than BitDefender.. My RAM & CPU usages are almost zero.. Non-existent as it were, Just 18MB RAM at Full-scan & 5 MB RAM at idle -- coupled with top-class 'zero' infections.."
Per-Magnus Persson,1,5,"I had a somewhat unusual request and great effort and consideration was extended to me to try and resolve my issue. The quality of communication was the reason I decided to purchase a Bitdefender product. I normally don't do surveys, but I was very impressed with the quality of the company."
Cadence Serna,1,5,"I had contacted Support to ask a question about my account and why my mobile phone wasn't covered under my subscription.  It turns out that I had purchased the plan that ONLY covered PC's, not phones.  After pointing this out, I thanked them very much for letting me know that I had made this mistake.  A couple of days later, they said they changed my subscription type to cover my phone at no charge!  So now, my 3 license subscription could be used on my PC and my phone!  I was thrilled and VERY thankful."
SM,1,1,"I installed this for myself and struggled for days to get it to work on the Mac - still not sure what I did that finally fixed it. Then I made the mistake of signing my mother up for it too. No matter what I do I can't get it to recognize that she has a 1 year subscription - it only associates with the trial version. Instead of addressing the issue, the customer service rep simply emailed back that their product isn't compatible with mac and that I had installed the wrong product. The product is up and running, and working on the mac, it's just on the trial version! I've asked my mom to see if she can get a refund and god knows what that will take. Why on earth it's so hard to get this working is beyond me."
Harold Fedoruk,2,5,Bitdefender Total Security 2016 is a very simple program to use and gets the job done without having to go through complicated hoops.The support for the program is excellent and fast to resolve any problems should you even have any.The best I've used in all the years I've been using PCs or laptops.
Karlene Marie Eechaute,1,1,"While the product itself is one that I have been loyal to for five years, their customer service is the WORST that I have ever encountered. I had contacted bitdefender about an error on their end (that went unnoticed by me for a few months) where they had charged me for two products when I had only needed one; because they had previously signed me up for auto-renewal without my permission. It was a simple error, and I had hoped that the issue could be corrected swiftly and peacefully. When I had contacted them about a refund or an extension of my contract from 1 year to 2 years (as that was what they had me paying for) my complaint was met with verbal assaults. Overall my correspondence consisted of multiple phone calls with a lady who repeatedly yelled at me, hung up on me, brought me to tears, and rudely referred to me with a series of some rather nasty names. As well as multiple false assurances by other spokespersons that a ""manager would call me back later."" Which were followed up by passive aggressive emails that followed the lines of ""We have marked the issue as solved,"" regardless of the fact that the issue had neither been solved nor addressed. Bitdefender did not approach the topic of the verbal assaults I received from their staff, nor was I ever compensated for the stress caused to me as a customer who was stolen from, faulted and verbally assaulted by an employee. It is unfortunate, because while I have favoured bitdefender in the past, I refuse to purchase the product of a company that insists on treating their customers like wild animals. The treatment I had received was uncalled for, and the money that they had essentially stolen from me (and blamed me for) could have gone towards something far more important; like my student tuition, or food."
Raymond,1,5,"I can recommend Bitdefender. Bitdefender doesn't slow down your computer like mcafee, Has a lot of usefull functions on board, runs very sillence and the most important: it kept my computer out of trouble the last year. This year I bought the multi device package and love the Bitdefender app. The app runs very smooth and the functionality  goes beyond every security app I know.What I don't like: the website, it deserves a better one. To much clicking and scrolling and no overview. To much products, It takes more than 30 mins to find the right product, read everything and compare it. The pricing, I love the offers, they are realy good, but they change all the time (sometimes a few times a day).I love settings! Bitdefender does not! It runs flawless here, but I don't have the feeling I'm the captain on the ship...The visual design isn't an eyecandy (and shouldn't be), but could use some color."
Shogo Serra,2,5,"There are many internet securities out there, but it so happens that this product is the right one for me! Questions on mind? Why not? BitDefender is always there to help you real time, and not just simply replying you with a chatbot!"
Jonathan,1,3,"Without my authorized, Bitdefender automatically withdrawn € 69.95 from my account and renew my license :(Shortly before the automatically renewal, BitDefender sent an offer ""10 days of protection remaining RENEW NOW € 24.95"" But I did not wish to renew. But 10 days later Bitdefender just took money (€ 69.95) anyway from my credit card without my consent.------------ Update ------------Order ID 52243026 well look forward to get a refund, thanks"
Natalia Kurop,5,5,I recently bought this product as I became aware that Mac is not as safe as it says it is and my Mac indeed was infected. I ran a deep scan Bitdefender   did its job perfectly.
Rudie,3,5,"I've used Bitdefender for over five years now and have recommended it to many of my clients.  When I upgraded my computers to Windows 10, one of them had a problem with the antispam function with Microsoft Office Outlook 2010.  I contacted Bitdefender via email.  I followed their instructions to supply them with the information they needed to solve the situation.  I then followed their instructions for the repair.  Easily done and problem solved.  I'll continue using Bitdefender and recommending it to my friends and clients."
Jennifer W.,3,5,"I've used Bitdefender for 3 years now on all of my devices and to protect my mother and grandparent's computers. Renewing each year is easy, they NEVER harass me about the service, and there's no hidden malware or any of that junk. It's just good, solid protection through and through!"
Eric,4,5,"We've tried many Antivirus programs in the past, often steering towards the free ones to avoids the added cost. But it seemed like they just didn't catch much. Perhaps we weren't getting anything to be caught but after several months I noticed that the computer was having audio issues and was freezing up a lot. I ran additional scans with the antivirus programs we had but they did nothing for the issues. It was at that point that I decided the age-old phrase of, ""you get what you pay for it"", was true. So we uninstalled the free antivirus programs we had and installed Bitdefender on both of our computers. Why Bitdefender? Well, we did extensive searches and article readings to come to the conclusion that Bitdefender looked to be what we wanted. We downloaded the free 30 day trial and ran the initial scan. After that scan, the audio issues were gone and the terminal has not frozen once since. I had to contact support one time. It was not for a technical issue, instead it was because I was an idiot and forget my password to get into our account. I used the online chat support and my issue was resolved in under 5 minutes! And the most amazing part of that was the fact that we got disconnected from our chat at one point and I had to start a new chat session. When I did I got the same support person and DID NOT have to rehash all of the details from the beginning. That NEVER happens!!! It's been about three months now since we started with Bitdefender and, at this moment, I couldn't recommend them more highly. We are very, VERY happy!"
Gregory,3,4,"I wish it would not take so long to reply to my emails. I had to bring my problem to Paypal resolution center in order to get the customer support center to respond. Otherwise, a great antivirus protection for Mac."
Trisha Mc.,3,5,Didn't know about it but got some solid advice - best gaming av software I encountered. Others simply don't compare
Ray Dale,1,1,"I bought BitDefender internet secuirity 2016 and tried insatalling on my Macpro.The link they sent were inactive,tried 4 times.Contacted technical support team and they wanted more details and remote access and things like that.Its pretty clear--'the link doesn't work"" what more details can i give?Requested for refund which is under process,hope the refund doesn't take long.I had used Norton,Kaspersky etc prior to this but never had such a hassle.Any one will be wary if a software company tries to get remote access to your computer to fix an issue with their software.BitDefender should improve the technical support.For a non tech guy,your technical support generic e mails are difficult to follow and in a moment of crisis will lose trust in this approach.I opted for refund because the technical support sounded like a long winding road with seemingly dangerous potholes.BitDefender should overhaul the tech support or the negative reviews are going to come thick and fast."
Susanne Maggrah,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender Total for a few years now, and have no compunction recommending it to others. When I had a technical question about the product, my request for assistance was promptly, courteously and knowledgeably responded to. I'm very happy with Bitdefender Total 2016, and will be renewing my subscription when this one runs out in approximately a month and a half. I also use it on my Android Smartphone, and I have no complaints with that either."
Christian Coward,1,1,If you dont login you will be notified every 5mins to do so by Bitdefender Central login screen ...Every 10mins you get an advertisement notification which is SO important that it must overlay everything else ...Your license is nearly down ? Better let me shown you even more ad ...So in fact the experience with Bitdefender was litterally fighting against a Malware that should keep an eye on Malware ... how ironic...
D L,1,1,"I renewed Bitdefender 2016 license in March of 2016.  I never authorized auto-renewal.Bitdefender auto-renewed my license, charging me $89.95, on August 23, 2016.   They had no right to do so, and their records would clearly show that I did not need to have it renewed anyway.  Now they are refusing to refund my money, demanding that I give them proof that I am not asking Paypal for a chargeback.  There is no chargeback request in place, but you might like to know that, according to Paypal customer service, Avangate does this ALL THE TIME.So if you don't want to be charged for products you don't need, and then get the run-around when you ask for a refund, take your business elsewhere."
S Banks,1,5,"I needed help with an issue. After submitting a request for assistance, I was contacted immediately by customer service. Their response and assistance was far better than expected. Their follow-up was outstanding and timely. Very rarely have I experienced customer service as good as this. Besides great customer service, their product is the best I have used."
Alexandru B,1,5,"I had bought an Antivirus software a bit longer than one year ago, but due to some issues i had given up on the licence due to technical reasons.      Fast forward about 6 months i had bought a new licence as i have a new pc and also bought a new licence for it because i was unable to find the key to the initial software. I then find out that they charged me on the initial licence i am NOT USING by simply renewing my subscription.      The same day i had contacted support, but it was useless. By now i still think the ticket is unopened by the accountings department. Because of this i ended up contacting them via Email. They replied in 5 days, apologizing, which is understandable, as i work in customer support too, and instead of CANCELLING the licence which is not used and just making the refund, their ""customer support"" offered me EXTRA 4 Months and a discount of about 20Euro,for a licence i do not only NOT want to use (total security 2015 - i currently have total security 2016),but also CAN NOT use due to the fact that i already have a newer licence. -I find this situation almost insulting, as i was offered the above mentioned solution, WITHOUT mentioning the posibility of cancelling the subscription and be refunded for the amount that has been withdrawn.-     I just replied to their ticket and will wait for an answer from them. Unless the situation gets solved how it is supposed to be, as in trying to solve the customers situation instead of trying to make the sale, i am under any kind of circumstance willing to change my rating.     Should the situation be solved properly, i will agree to adjust the rating accordingly.     Edit: 9days later they confirm the refund of the amount. They say it takes 5-7days to see the refund.We'll see.     Edit2: Everything got solved. I was refunded.          I would consider having a more visual information about the avangate account on your website instead of having that somewhere hidden and about the automatic subscription."
Bionic Wolf,2,5,"Purchased heavily discounted BD Internet Security 2015 a year ago. I stalled and then uninstalled as it ""slowed"" my system IMO. I developed squamous cell carcinoma non HPV and non-TREATABLE. Was given 6 months to live 15 Apr 2015. The computer began acting funny so I remembered I had BD still with a month to go on my 1 year purchase so I installed it and on a whim decided to ask BD to allow me to use their product until I died.    I received a reply the NEXT DAY granting me a full year, PLUS an UPGRADE with all the features/functionality.  Their prompt response and compassion came as a surprise to me because I admitted I didn't use their product. Quite AMAZING customer care and support from the Bit Defender team-A HEARTFELT thank you once again Bit Defender Team from a very grateful customer."
samzoe12579,1,5,"I have never had any problems with my Computer since I started using Bitdefender many years ago.I find it easy to understand and use, with each year higher protection added to keep us safe while enjoying all that is there on the internet.Christine."
Linda Joy,10,5,I only changed over to Bitdefender a couple of months ago but I have been very happy with their service. It keeps telling me my Mac is safe and / so I haven't experienced any bugs! When I contacted them for advice they were very helpful.
John Klopotowski,1,1,"This is the 3rd time I have renewed my subscription with weeks left on my old one and always had the same problem; I had to FIGHT to get the balance put on my new one!! I am right doing the same thing, AGAIN, right now, to get what is owed me. The support team, what a joke, is telling you to do things from text, not what they know!! You are speaking to someone in a different ""COUNTRY""!!!! Based in Florida but out scored to another Country. I have given them 3 years of my renewing but they just don't get it! Do yourself a favor and find a better Internet Security Program; I am looking  now for one..."
nev briggs,1,4,I don't have the vocab to xplain my mis.understandings ..
Malcolm Odell,4,5,The bitdefender team solved my problem which was caused by me uninstalling microsoft windows 10 to revert to windows 7. Despite dealing with a completely non computer literate person the problem was sorted and my computer is now running perfectly.Thank you.
Albert Hachler,1,5,Great customer care. Easy to implement and use. Feel more secure according to the point of view if security products have yes or no to be implemented.
Ford Dye,1,5,I love this virus protection program suite and I use it on my PC and smartphone. The customer service is also top notch and I would recommend BitDefender to anyone!
Fathi Ben Nasr,1,5,"I nearly eradicated virus on my computers, physical and virtual servers thanks to Bitdefender GravityZone."
michael wong,1,5,Bitdefender Support Team is quick in response to request and resolve issues quickly.
Kevin Foggie,2,5,"The product seems to handle all issues that it advertises.  I don't use Autopilot mode, therefore I see all the popup boxes indicating what the program is monitoring and requesting. I like this way, albeit when there are issues, I make the request for customer service to explain or clarify.  The tech support is fast, knowledgeable and thorough in doing follow-ups.  Seriously consider this product for quality and integrity of genuinely concerned for the customers complete satisfaction. Far exceeds expectations and other companies should follow their lead."
Narene,1,1,"My account was automatically debited $135 AU, whilst website advert for the renewal as approx $90 AU. For five days  have been trying to get a refund of my monies paid. As soon as I disputed the payment Bitdefender suspended my subscription but refunding my money is not such a priority! They would not refund my money until I cancelled he PayPal dispute but still two days on my money has not been returned. Finally received today an email saying that they have acknowledged my dispute has been cancelled but still no indication of when my money will be returned. It's an ongoing saga with this company"
Ian Cowie,21,5,I downloaded the wrong version for my mac.I emailed Bitdefender and they fixed it as soon as possible. You can't ask for any better service than that.
Alan,33,5,I have been a Bitdefender Multi Device user for a couple of years and whenever I have had to contact them with a query it has always been handled quickly and professionally to ensure the fix has been supplied as quickly as possible.I would readily recommend Bitdefender to anyone.
Eric Moore,2,1,"Essentially the install link provided from my account is a 32-bit version.  When I run the software their installed indicates I need a 64-bit version.  The company was wanting me to try some vague software to scan my system for viruses.  That I declined.  It was something I had never heard of before.  I did scan the system with Malware bytes and that reported nothing.  I then scanned with AVG, nothing.  I've sent about 7 or 8 emails back and forth and get the dumbest answers.  I have run their tools that don't complete and I've explained that to them.  Nothing.  Do yourself a favor and try a more established product.  That was my last mistake with these people."
Jamison Brown,1,5,"My system is secure, runs faster than with my last program, and great customer service too. Extremely satisfied customer here."
Reza Dharmawan,1,4,"Formidable protection against virus, spyware or ransomware. Yet doesn't burden the system much. All security packages you need within reasonable price."
Tyrin Gregory Lynn,1,4,"I had a problem with activating my purchase, and when I contacted customer support I got informed via email as to what I should do. My problem was solved within the next few days of me putting in the ticket."
Vassilis Kakoulantonakis,1,5,Great software and excellent support!
Paul Page,1,5,I have used Bitdefender for about  the past 5 years and in my opinion its the best anti virus product on the market
Scott Adie,1,4,"I have been using Bitdefender Total Security on multiple machines for several years. In that time none of my machines, 3 of them, have ever been compromised. I hear some complaints about Bitdefender slowing machines down and yes, a minor slow down has been my experience too. Here's the deal with that, if you expect ANY antivirus, malware, firewall software to function interactively, it will slow things a little. Just ask yourself, is the minimal slow down in performance better than having my machine hacked, infected or crashed? It the answer is YES, then Bitdefender is a contender."
Carol Barton,1,1,"I have made repeated attempts to get the promised refund if not satisfied with Bitdefender.  I have gotten nothing but delays and unfulfilled promises.  It is now 3 weeks since my first refund request and I still do not have my money back.  Some may like the product.  I did not.  But like the product or not, there is NO excuse for such shoddy and non-resonsive customer service"
Nicolas Renne,2,5,"I am taking care of my PC every day and I am not having anyone to consult when I have a problem.The experts working at Bitdefender that contact me to solve the problem I  had, they did using tutorials that was easy for me to follow. I am very thankful for the precise knowledge applied in their help."
Ken,1,5,My problem of adding another device to my software subscription was solved with one email and a follow-up phone call by the company.
Kevin Lee,1,5,"I've used a variety of security products, including Sophos, TrendMicro, Norton, and now Bitdefender for the last three years. I'm sticking with Bitdefender. Pricing is reasonable, support, when needed, is accurate and fairly quick. Plus, my systems have been safe since installations."
Richard Price,1,1,"Copy of letter sent to Bitdefender, for which they still take no responsibility - As stated in further emails, BITD sent me off to a 3rd party support group to assist in the installation. This group required remote access to the computers and convinced the operator that there was a multitude of invasions that needed to be removed. This extra work, for the 3 corporate computers, would cost an additional $1900.00. That price was negotiated down to $1100.00, and they insisted they would need to return every 3 months to check over the system for further issues. In the meantime, the system was examined by a tech expert who stated they were pulling a con on us. The issues they were claiming to remove didn't exist. The next time they called, they were dismissed, but they would not accept that. They threatened the office staff with major computer problems if they were not allowed back in. They were hung up on. They called back and tried to gain access by sweet talking the secretary. They would have been charged with sexual harassment had they been in Canada. Again hung up on. This was all listed to Bitdefender, and your response was ""We are not responsible for 3rd party interactions that customers have"". Normally I would agree, but you sent me to these people, which makes you responsible for their actions. Your lack of ownership of your mistake will bite you in the butt.               In reply to your reply - 1/ Your 3rd party installers took me for $1100. I contacted you at that time and you refused any complicity. 2/ Since then, I removed all traces of their work, names, addresses, and anything else that may have been used as a back door into my system. 3/ Don't tell me one year later you want to help. You should have done that in the beginning. Now you are just trying to put out the fire by making it look like you are the good guys who just want to help. You didn't care then, You don't care now. Own up to it. You screwed up and it cost me, and now I hope it costs you."
George Fotopoulos,1,5,"So far Bitdefender has proven very good and effective. They have also a very good customer service, both times I contacted them (once for a billing issue regarding auto renewal) and once for a matter regarding my account, they were very fast and effective to remedy the situation to my satisfaction."
Aman ansari,1,5,Bitdefender is definitely the the best anti virus software out there and it has the lowest impact on you system. Detection rate is 100% in my opinion. If you don't believe try it for 30 days.
Pops,2,5,Bitdefender has consistently been there for my protection and their customer care is off the charts. A Live person available 24/7. Their the best in the business. I would and have recommended Bitdefender to so many friend's and family.
Wendy,3,5,"I have used Bitdefender for three years and it works perfectly without interrupting anything (unlike my previous antivirus program, which slowed my computer down greatly). The service is unbeatable: I had a question about adding other devices to my subscription, which covered 3 PCs. I had a response from a real person within hours, and soon afterwards another email informing me that my account had been upgraded without charge to 'multi-device' - not just PCs. Finally - the $60 discount on renewal: where could you get a better offer?"
Rob,1,5,"Sometimes it takes one really good agent to make your day, I got mine this evening, the lady made it so simple for me to have my query resolved to the point that all I had to do was switch on my PC, watch BD go through its config and bingo, magic wand waved and all my problems disappeared!!!"
Ali Punk,1,5,"They are seriously the best Antivirus and they have the most amazing contact support team .. they helped me and checked back on me , no other company does that.Sincerely,A permanent Bitdefender member""Alex"""
Tom Krasovec,1,5,"I caught a bad case of the stupids and clicked a link that was obviously bogus.  By the time I realized that I had engaged a ransomware package (thanks to Bitdefender Ransomware Protection), something over 30,000 files had been encrypted, most of them on an external drive for which I did not configure BD Ransomware.  I did not lose my system, but I thought I had lost a LOT of photos, music and miscellaneous archival files.  I did not think BD had a prayer of getting them decrypted, but I have never been so happy about being wrong!"
Daphne Phoenix,1,5,"The series of 'whole-supporting' e-mails I've received from their 'customer care' dept did exceed my expectations -as to promptness and  effectiveness, let alone their professional politeness- insinuating 'Total Quality Management' -favorite subject since the period of my studies, long ago.  Apart from feeling 'relaxed' to have found the company I could deeply trust, I also felt kind of joy realizing that, yes, it IS sometimes possible that hypothetical 'models' of customer-focus businesses to exist in reality! Simply said, I would highly recommend Bitdefender!Ps. I've slightly edited the above review, feeling even more satisfied after having entered Trustpilot page [for my very first time] to find great reviews by some other people who seemingly understand much more than I on relevant technology. So I felt obliged to add the last sentence to initial text."
Bruce Robertson,3,5,I was very satisfied and pleased with the service and quick response I received from the Bitdefender Customer Care team to solve my problem.
Nothappyconsumer,1,1,Not at all helpful. I only joined them this morning. This has been my first impression and I am not impressed so far at all!  I'm not sure if there was a language barrier but all I got was big silences together with yes and no responses with no backup information to answer my question. It was like pulling teeth.
Rahul Wankhede,1,5,Customer care representative was very friendly and helpful.
Rick,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for several years now after a close friend told me to give it a try. I was tired of the other big well known antivirus providers having way too much control over what I did and how I used my computer and external links. I have some training in computers so I do understand a lot more than just basics and this programming is far superior to others I have tried. Bitdefender does a superb job of insulating and protecting me from the ravages of the open web and all the trolls and garbage that is there to destroy your computer and experiences. It quietly operates in the back ground with no measure of impedance to the speed of my computer. They offer a whole host of tools to use to keep oneself safe on the internet and make life simple. I use the majority of them that come with the program and am quite happy with the results. I have several desktops and laptops set up with Bitdefender, including my kids and I have had very few issues with the programs. Any issues I did have were quickly resolved by their courteous and knowledgeable staff. My sons first laptop had the original antivirus that it was bought with, a very well known brand, and he complained of it being terribly slow and glitchy after several months of use, so I removed the old antivirus using Bitdefender and installed Bitdefender's brilliant programming and he has told me it has been working flawlessly ever since. I would recommend this anti-virus software to anyone and have to my friends and family, including setting up my parents with it. Thanks to them, my computing experiences have been quite enjoyable and safe!"
Chris,1,5,"Bitdefender exceeded all my expectations in dealing with a problem I was experiencing while trying to install and activate Internet Security. They were very quick in responding to my emails and I am very satisfied with the resolution they provided. Good follow up, very professional, exceptionally helpful. I will continue to support them and will recommend Bitfender to all."
Flor,2,5,"I recently had problems when I tried to reinstall the antivirus, but they provided assistance right away. Good product and outstanding service! I highly recommend it."
herman,1,5,Quick response and excellent service.
Nate Hill,1,5,"I have tried all the other top tier antivirus apps and Bitdefender is hands down walking away the best. It's footprint on my pc is very light, yet it keeps my pc protected.What more can you ask for? Thank you team Bitdefender!"
RENELL SHURN,1,5,I knew I came back to BitDefender for a reason. Michael of their support team was very helpful in making sure adding my new tablet to my current account was very simple.  And we both had a sense of humor about it all too.I was a BD customer some years back. But wanted to try other Internet Security suites out there. I'm glad I came back to BD.
Francisco (Frank) Garcia II,1,4,My experience with Bitdefender has been very helpful i communicating my thoughts concerning the use of this product. Thanks for providing this forum.
Leo Widlak,2,5,Have been a Bitdefender user for a numbrr of years. And have had some issues too. But the Bitdefender support team handles these quickly and adequately. I am very satisfied with their product and support!
John Hoy,1,5,Al of the qualities I had been looking for. I have used almost every internet security product available.I have kept Bitdefender for 3 years and still like how well it integrates into my  computer setup. I use a blacklist hosts file and browse with a secure DNS server. I use Secunia PSI and like that the Bitdefender product also scans for software security updates. I like how easy it is to renew the product and how informative the customer service reps are.Always reasonably priced.
Oskar Lind,7,5,Been using a lot of different antivirusprogrammes but not been real satisfied until I bought Bitdefender.Products works smooth and does not make my computer to slow down. Also Bitdefender has an excellent techservices and always help you within moments.With Bitdefender I feel safe so I recommend it for you all
Filipe Moncalvo,1,5,I recommend to everyone. Definitely #1 in security.
Jim,3,5,"Easy to use, peace of mind. Excellent Tech team and customer service"
Jim Hindhaugh,2,5,It's not often that I have to contact Bitdefender Support but when I have the response has been both swift and concise.  The team are highly proficient and knowledgeable about the product and seem to care very much about the end user!Thank you once again for all your help and assistance in resolving my problem...
Mac,4,5,"After a considerably long time in solving my problem. I was willing to give up and use another supplier, but customer care  [Critian] kept at it until a satisfactory conclusion, My emails were answered in extremely quick time and I appreciate all his help.I would not  hesitate to recommend Bitdefender to all my friends if/when a security software is required.."
Akshat Mehra,1,5,They are indeed a great company. The support team is very good and the antivirus is the best.
Troels H,72,2,"Has used bitdefender for a while and been fairly happy with the anitvirus part of the product... Apparently the firewall/webshield functionality uses self-issued certificates when visiting secure sites which makes firefox go crazy with certificate warnings... Nevertheless the product works fairly well all-in-all BUT....I have 3 devices and 2 years left and wanted to buy more devices so I bought a 5 device 1 year license ekstra through bitdefender.com which uses avangate.com... WHAT A DISASTER... the new license cannot be added without removing my current 2 year license in bitdefender central - basically my key is useless ... Secondly, when I wrote Avangate.com (the reseller) they didn't answer or write back in several days so I raised a dispute in paypal... Guess what, suddenly I had a mail from Avangate, stating that  they would NOT look at refund until I withdrew my paypal dispute... I told them they could use that for refunding but they would not hear of it...Ok. I withdrew my dispute knowing I couldnt dispute that transaction again and guess what, Avangate just sent a mail that they told Bitdefender to refund and closed the matter... Needless to say Im outraged by the way Avangate and Bitdefender communicates and the way they hold the customer hostage between them in a dispute, I paid the transaction to Avangate, not Bitdefender - shady company policies getting close to scam... fortunately I have other Bitdefender/Avangate transactions I can use for a dispute in paypal BUT im not using any other company which distributes though Avangate .... Guess I will look at webroot og Kaspersky instead..."
Agosto Acasio,1,5,Very user friendly.  It does things other security software didn't clearly do for me.
Martha Insall,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for several years and have always been pleased with the product and the service. It has always performed well. When I have needed tech assistance the excellent help provided has always met every expectation. Easy to install and easy to renew. I would recommend Bitdefender to anyone looking for  high performance for their computers, etc."
Yanosh,1,5,Easy to use and good set of needed features. Also no annoying notifications. (This opinion is related to android antivirus app only.)
SAW,2,5,"After a system crash on windows 10 due to a different  3rd party firewall install,  I thought I had lost Bitdefender Antivirus 2016. I contacted Bitdefender customer support and was talked through and helped with reinstalling my purchased (licensed) product. Everything is back and running perfect again. Just wondering now if I should upgrade to their Total Protection. I won't be installing the other company's firewall that caused the crash, but Bitdefender is working again, as well as the pc. Thank you Bitdefender support."
Mammooth,2,5,"I am using their product for just a short time now, but so far I am happy with them. I had to contact them once so far, the support was fast, detailed and in a friendly manner."
Marlene Puttick,7,5,I had a problem after buying Bit-Defender as my grandson had used my PC and had left Facebook open and on login I used Facebook and was logged  in as him this caused lot of problems but they where sorted by the customer support team swiftly and courteously I could not have asked for better support.
Unhappy Customer,1,1,"Paid through Avangate. Received two confirmation mails, but didn't receive a license code. Sent a mail to Avangate. Avangate just sends a mail it doesn't provide support, just a a default message to contact Bitdefender. When I go to the contact page of Bitdefender it turns out it's impossible to fill in the contact form. Had contact with support by chat, telling me to contact Avangate. I sent the message I received from Avangate, telling me to contact Bitdefender. After an hour trying to solve my problem I received no solution at all to BUY a license."
Edris Salih,1,1,"Last year friend of mine is introduced me to Bitdefender. This year 10 days before expires I got an email from Bitdefender that my license will renewal for one more year and the charge will be 99.95 USD. I replied that I do not need renewal with from the United States and also this amount is very expensive. they ignored my email. I have sent another 4 emails within 4 days, but again ignored me and they did not care about my request. On June 18 they charged me 99.95 USD while few days before that I renwal my license with Bitdefender Canada ($29 Canadian). I called my visa card and then I called Bitdefender and they toled will take care of everything and will refund my money. Again it took several days nothing happened,. I called again they told my again we will working on it. After another 4-5 days I got an email and they offered three years if do not ask for refund. I disagreed and I asked for my refund. again it took several days and also I called. Again they told me we are working on it. After 16 days, Yesterday, they refund my money, but how? They charged me $132,55 Canadian, but for the refund they returned for me $127.25 Canadian. The truth is they traded with me with the profit of $5. So, after all these days and hard times, as a customer satisfaction they should have given me, let say, one year free BitDefender; but, unfortunately they trade with my money plus they all these hard times and neglection!"
Ronita Alderman,2,1,"trying to access scan history bitdefender help, help pages both not even as good as BAD NOT RECOMENDED!!!"
Gary Willett,1,5,As per title: Good product and good service from customer representatives.
Randy Thiesen,1,5,"Not only is Not defender top shelf when it comes to killing virus's, worms and what not, but it has always been fair when it comes to cost. Thanx BD"
Adrian Seni,1,5,Thank You BitDefender!
Jean-Michel,3,5,"Generally speaking, BitDefender Internet Security appears to be an efficient tool for maintaining the integrity of Customers configurations.In my case, the Technical Support Team has demonstrated its ability to send sound advices to help me solve the issues I've encountered on my Personal Computer.In addition I would point out that they appear to be pretty reactive, thus demonstrating their awareness of what should be a good Customer Service in a Technical Support Department."
Avin,1,5,"I have never experienced being infected by a virus or malware since using Bitdefender. Install it and forget about it. It's true, it is really light on your system."
David Walters,1,5,Bitdefender was very professional and their assistance invaluable.  They continued to follow through and provided tailored assistance until all adware was eliminated. They went far beyond my original expectations.
Bill Murray,2,5,"I have Bitdefender on 1 desktop and 2 laptops, and it is very efficient.When I upgraded to Win 10 I had configuration issues, and received prompt effective assistance from Bitdefender support.I would recommend Bitdefender as efficient antivirus software and Bitdefender as a trustworthy company."
Linda Madruga,2,5,"Bitdefender has been above excellent since I first changed to them years ago.  I have absolutely no worries about the safety of my computer.  If I have a question for them, the response is immediate.  I would HIGHLY recommend them, and do, to everyone I know."
michelle niznik,1,1,"Brought the family pack on the 13/06/16 and have been hit up 3 times...so instead of $69 it has cost me 3x that amount, suppose to be maned 24hrs what a load of CRAP only getting generated messages...BE VERY CAREFUL OF THIS COMPANY...NOT FRIGGEN HAPPY"
Teresa Pena,1,2,I have had to contact Bitdefender customer service 3 times. First while trying to install and then twice for separate issues including a popup from their site to create an account when I have an account and over half a year of service left. Their response is always an link to an article on line. A useless article which helps in no way. I am not computer savvy and I have had to figure out how to fix these issues on my own which in cases has taken me DAYS. I will never purchase this again at least with Norton and McAffee you had help.
Wong Yu Cheng,1,5,i been using bitdefender for 2 years and i love it and it help me to remove 70 sample of virus and i strongly suggest all to get bitdefender <3and it use in my company as well
Miloš Marjanović,1,5,I feel safe and protected when bitdefender is up.
Keith Robinson,1,5,Bitdefender not only have  outstanding products but they back that up with a fantastic customer care service and are always one click away from resolving your problems
Todd Zocchi,1,1,Good job not taking off the training wheels no matter how many options i turn off on your program and not allowing me to download specific mods/files for the games i love to play.
Jamie,1,5,Excellent product that enables you to monitor multiple devices from one central site. Highly recommend
F.D.,2,5,I recently changed from my Bitdefender Total Security for 3 devices to the Family Pack and I was kindly assisted through installation. Their service is prompt and effectiv. I can strongly recommend Bitdefender Total Security which I've been using for some years!
Thomas Stephens,1,5,In my job I travel the world where potential problems with my computers are abundant and different in each place I go. I have used Bitdefender for many years on PCs and Apple products. My experiences with Bitdefender have been above all expectations and I credit their product in preventing many problems that I could have incurred.
kenny,1,5,"I tried everyone else from across the spectrum (web root, MacAfee, and Norton) nothing compares to the level of security Bitdefender provides me and for me it is over kill but, $ for $ it is the best way to go and I am always trying to get my friends to use this before they get a problem not after because, the removal tools do not work."
Tracey-Lee Gosling,1,5,No problems and easy to understand. Uses hardly any resources.
James Sinclair,1,5,"Contrary to the post I read recently saying that Bitdefender's customer service had gone to sh** my experience was actually quite good. There is probably about 10 hours difference between time zones so when I received an intelligent, polite, and most importantly, effective solution to my problem within a single day, I was surprised and impressed. My only gripe is that it took me some time trolling through Bitdefender Central and other online resources to find a solution to no avail, and what seems by happenstance I stumbled across their help desk email service. Ideally they should provide a more rigorous 24 hour chat service. All said and done though Bitdefender is in a class above and has been for some time now so minor gripes like mine are easily overlooked. I am paying for a service that provides protection and they do it better than any other so for now I'm a BitdeFRIENDer."
Karun Kumar Shingari,2,5,"Awesome !! Spectacular, praiseworthy support :) Thank you :) Top class service :) The Bitdefender team is simply amazing & out of this world :) Can’t wait for a further renewal next year with u guys :) Keep up the good work :) Three cheers for the Bitdefender team : Hip, hip, hurray !! The amount of hardwork you put in daily 24 X 7 just to resolve our concerns at the earliest is simply exemplary :) Dr. Karun Kumar (A proud owner of Bitdefender Total Security 2015). I would recommend Bitdefender to everyone out there in all seasons"
Ray,1,5,Quick response on a tired norwegian's problem. :)
Rick Mercer,1,1,"Firstly, I purchased my 2015 Bitedefender Anti-virus online. I was then, recently offered an ""early-bird"" special , as a valued customer. I was led to believe that my new purchase of the 2016 Bitedefender would replace my 2015 purchase. And then an attempt was made on my credit card to ""double-dip"", for my 2015 anti-virus anyway. I called customer support and they apologized for the incident, or what I call, the attempted ""theft"", of my money. I was then promised by the woman at customer service, that the 2015 Bitedefender subscription payment would NOT go through, as I cancelled my 2015 subscription. Having  put my trust into what the woman had told me at customer service, I then, loaded my pre-paid card up to pay for my car insurance payment. The Bitefender lying thieves then went ahead and stole my money anyway, causing my car insurance payment to not go through. Bitedefender should maybe design an anti-theft software and market it on themselves.....plain and simple ...LIARS AND THIEVES !!"
Allyson,7,5,"I have been using bitdefender for four years great product never slows down my computer , always pleased with the deals offered year to year, customer service absolutely amazing replied to within a very short time always go above and beyond to help with anything. I would definitely recommend this company/product to anyone looking for a reliable antivirus that protects every inch of your computer"
Bostjan Podojstersek,1,5,Would like to recommend Bitdefender products for those who like to have fast PC's even with additional anti virus/malware/firewall software installed. You will not realise that great security service is running in background and doing good job.
Nick Hund,1,1,If I could do zero stars then I would. I bought the program in hopes it would fix my kid's PC. It didn't do nearly as well as it was described it would.  1 of the computers won't start up afterwords. The other is running slower. And mine is about the same (No infections found anyways).  I asked for a refund well within the 30 day money back period and was insulted and lied to on the phone. They told me that they had more important things to do and they couldn't transfer me to the person I should be talking to. I was told I would get a follow up email or phone call several times and haven't heard a word back. I will be filing with the BBB and also going to my attorney if this isn't resolved. They have lied and deceived since day 1. I want my money back. IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!
Balaram Chowdary,1,5,Bitdefender has best customer service and handles almost every case with good response.
Muhammad Raffi Athallah Miraza,1,5,This Antivirus is not too much wear on my Laptop RAM. Nice AV ;)
Andy Castro,2,5,"EVERYTIME I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM, WHICH HAVE BEEN FEW, I RECEIVED THE HELP I NEEDED, AND YOU CAN COUNT ON THEM 24/7.I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND BITDEFENDER, IN THE PAST I HAVE HAD OTHERS AND I HAVE ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS GALORE. I DO RECOMMEND BITDEFEDER HIGHLY."
Richard Strauss,1,5,Roxanna of Bitdefender was very help full and sent me a email detailing what the fault I had and how to solve it I would recommend Bitdefender to everyone who needs a security system for their pc.
Philip Hickman,12,5,"I contacted Bitdefender by email as I required to change my email address and I appeared to have lost my subscription.Within a couple of hours they had sorted out all the issues.They kept me informed and I was delighted with the overall experience.Pity some of our other large UK companies, who will remain nameless, couldn't follow their example. Keep up the excellent work Bitdefender"
Yksi,1,5,"Beyond the quality of the program itself, Support Team is just awesome. Only such a package is a full option."
David,1,5,I have had adverse experience with other programmes where support is either non existent or delayed and/or confusing. I was therefore very pleasantly surprised at the quick and helpful (also very patient) assistance I received from the Bitdefender support staff.
Udo,3,5,I am very satisfied with the functions and working of BitDefender in the background but very effectiv and reliable.Instant and competent support!
Kathi,2,3,Their antivirus is ok but their support is horrible.
FC,1,5,"I have 3 devices registered, and needed to renew one. I didn't do it correctly and made a mess of things. Customer service answered, did everything they could well past business hours, elevated the issue as needed, and within a few hours everything was corrected and I'm good to go now. Thanks so much!"
Tony,1,5,"I have had Bitdefender for a number of years. Has worked very well in sense that nothing has gone wrong which means Bitdefender is doing its job. Also Bitdefender customer service has been excellent, easy to reach and have always got the problem solved. Thanks much."
DeeM,22,1,"I bought this product and received a notification that my licence was ""about to expire"". So I duly bought another year's subscription. Without knowing it the original licence auto renewed. Which is fine: I can understand how this might happen. BUT the customer service was appalling; three calls and the issue is still not resolved. No-one calls back. No representative takes ownership of the issue. No manager calls back as promised. I was told another department had to deal with it, which they didn't. Their product may be fine, but if the whole value chain is let down by appalling customer service I, for one, will not be using this company again..."
David Muir,6,5,Tended to go for the best deal looking around the big name virus scanners but have settled on Bitdefender for the past few years. Treads the fine line between silently protecting the household PCs and letting you know it is 'alive and kicking'. Has stopped a few dodgy sites/downloads that gaming teenagers can find themselves involved with as reviewing the log files has told me.Will continue to use this application for the foreseeable future.
Kostas Giannoutsos,1,5,"I followed this software throughout so much searching and saw a huge 'soul' in a company behind ,that just want's to be on top and it does...."
Paul Sunley,3,5,I have been using Bit Defender over the last year. I have found both the product and customer service to be great and have exceeded my initial expectations. I would happily recommend this product to any of my whanau and friends. :-)
Vladimir,1,4,All solved.Clean and safe.A little bit annoyed with tray popups but it is ok.Automatic renewal is not so implicit as should be.
Kenny,1,5,"I have three rather different computers in my home network. I was no longer happy last year with a high priced competitor that I used faithfully for 10 years so I started researching PC type magazines online for who is reliable and who isn't.My research revealed what I suspected, my anti-virus provider was coasting on their reputation. I paid the price for Bitdefender because they were rated number 1 Now, almost a year later, still pleased with Bitdefender; and they offered me a renewal price that I could not pass up.I had difficulties with one lap top computer, but Bitdefender's tech crew worked with me relentlessly until the problem is no more.Thank You Bitdefender"
Richard Gamble,1,5,Bit defender has been an all-in-one solution to my pc needs.  The family pack option is a lifesaver.  Now I can make sure my parents pc can be scanned and cleaned even when I'm not home.
Lori Monasmith Hay,1,2,My subscription was automatically renewed 2 DAYS BEFORE the current one expires!  I planned to cancel the current subscription BEFORE it expired and was not given the chance.  I had already recently purchased a different Bitdefender package for a newer computer and so did not need this one anymore.  Automatically renewing and charging my credit card BEFORE the current one expired is fishy business.  Dissatisfied with the outcome of my chat session with customer support.
Bob Dickinson,2,5,"I had a problem that I could not resolve so I turned to Bitdefender support and with there help I have fixed a problem that I had searched all over the net and downloaded quite a few you tube video's, nothing worked until bitdefender support gave me the tools and the know how to fix the problemMany ThanksBob"
George,1,5,I have used this product for the last 3 years.No problems with any type of malware.I always look at the top ten of the total security software before renewing.Bitdefender is always number one.That is why I return to this product.It just sits on the computer doing what it is supposed to do quietly with no fuss and very little input.I would recommend this product with out reservation.
Joel Monaghan,1,4,Bitdefender is a quiet background program.  It does a good job blocking and avoiding incoming threats.  I like the vulnerability feature which makes it easy to keep software up to date.  I just recently had an issue renewing my subscription and after 1 email the tech support had my problem sorted out that afternoon.
Andy,1,5,"Contacted the customer service and they are helpful, friendly and able to solve my problem. Highly recommended"
patrek,1,5,"When I deal with bitdefender be happy, how the risk of being repelled. Of all the dangers that are either on the Web or on the device. This is the best information security. This is the love of field."
Bill Freeling,1,5,"I have rarely had such an outstanding experience with customer service in the software industry but I can truly say that the support team at Bitdefender  set a new high bar for me.  They were fast, thorough, and extremely courteous.  I always thought the product was great but now know that they have a great support team as well."
AJ Brochovich,1,1,"I have been charged twice in the past two years with out my permission.  I let the first time slide, and made sure the second time I deleted my debit card information, so they will not charge it again. Then I notice they changed my card again the following year.  I do not know how they got my card number, and they kept telling me, I had the automatic payment selected.  I told them ""NO, I would never do that, not even for other purchases from other venders"".  I always make sure my card is charged one time fee only, not auto pay.  They are liars!  So if you want your card charged every year with out your permission, then be my guest.  I for one do not!!!"
Hisham Tajeddine,1,5,"i have tried all antivirus solutions on my laptop and smartphone, but none was effective, lightweight and reliable more that bitdefender products. even the free solutions you provide are better than many of competition paid solutions."
Michael Ponzani,1,5,Almost nothing slips past BD.  Once in a while something does.  I know not to open the ransom ware.  BD is an excellent product.  I wonder if governments use this?
Gary Frazier,2,5,bitdefender  has  worked  very  well  for  me  i  have  used  it  for  about  three  years  now  and  will  continue  to  .
Tom Medsker,1,5,"There are bad guys everywhere on the Internet.  Some disguise themselves as good guys.  Bad guys hijacked my browser.  First, they were only tracking me.  Then they dictated where I could go on the Internet.  It was ad, after ad, after ad.With their expertise, programs and a few third party anti-virus scans, Bitdefender got the bad guys out of my files.  Now, they are keeping the bad guys out of my files.  This protection seems to be a necessity for anyone using the Internet."
Stephen,4,5,I could not install my product on my PC.Contacted Customer Care for assistance.They solved my problem immediately.Excellent service.
Clint,1,5,"However. . . . It was solved by the bitdefender program itself when the next update was scheduled. But for the first time in probably five years of having the Bitdefender program installed on 3 out of the 4 computers I have, I actually had a representative email me who genuinely seemed concerned in my issue even though it wasn't a serious issue thankfully."
Peter Schieber,1,1,After several years of using BDIS on 4 of my PC with two separate licences these licences were merged by mistake into a single one for just 1 PC and for 3 weeks now I am trying to have the problem resolved unsuccessfully so my rating has dropped accordingly
Nikita Jones,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for several years.  Three reasons for sticking too the product is the ease of use and excellent technical reviews.  Third reason is the excellent customer support.  I have never been dissapointed with their help.  They follow-up with each problem until it is resolved.Mike
VJ,1,3,"Generally it seems okay.  Have been using a couple of weeks.  But every time I open a financial website, i.e., bank or paypal, it says/asks""We recommend  Bitdefender Safepay to protect online transactions.  Would you like to open it now?"" I do NOTwant to open it... as it interfers with my ability to screen capture /save things I want to record. So I check ""remember for this website"" and ""remember for all banking websites""  and click NO.  But it keeps popping up and asking me over and over and everytime I go to any financial site.  Have not yet tried customer support.  But if they can't fix this.....!!!!!"
Anthony Robert Yagovane Jr.,1,5,"I have tried many as i am sure that we have all done, Since I Ileft for the entire week with my home pc online,came back home and there was one event. that event was,"" restart your computer so that up-dates can do what they do. Would not ever leave my computer on like that but there was no problems.   That's """"BITDEFENDER"""" for you ! ! ! Anthony Yagovane Jr."
Frank Lastnamenotrequired,1,5,"I lost my product licence due to an unrecoverable crash, I had to reinstall on a new computer. The support center helped me find my licence and install Bitdefender on my new computer."
Andres Darvasi,2,5,"Had a problem with Antivirus for Mac, probably caused by a recent upgradee of the Mac's operating system. Contacted Bitdefender customer service, and the problem was resolved quickly and efficiently via email with precise instructions and inmediate response to my questions."
Muray Elliott,1,5,"Great support on an issue that I had tried to solve with another company to no avail. Got very detailed instructions on how to fix the problem which worked beautifully, Appreciated the follow up that everything was working well."
Jim Clement,1,5,"I have been a BitDefender User since 2011. I have needed to contact their Support Center twice in five years. Once for a technical issue, once for an accounting issue. Both times, the issues were resolved via e-mail in a rapid professional manner.I have recommended BitDefender to over 100 people, many who have bought the product. I will continue to be a loyal BitDefender customer provided the company maintains their extremely high standards."
Des11,23,5,Bitdefender appears to be a very stable and none interfering system.I shall purchase the full version at the end of my trial period.
Gerard Krupa,1,4,"Charged £72 to my PayPal account for automatic renewal of a product and then the next day when I checked, their account management system said I had no subscription and all my PCs were left unprotected which isn't great.Contacted support and the issue was fixed around a day later along with being comped 30 days on the subscription."
Dick Smith,1,5,great experience
Lee Sterne,1,5,"Bitdefender solved my problem (my remaining time from previous subscription was dropped when I renewed), but it is the kind of problem that should never have occurred in the first place. Bitdefender, like all companies, want to keep their current customers, and when it becomes a hassle to renew service contracts, you defeat your purpose. When a customer renews or upgrades, their remaining time of service should be reflected automatically. It's better to prevent a problem than to solve it."
Vinay,1,4,"BD worked for me like a charm. Perhaps the best AV out there, I am a loyal user since the past 5 years. Its economical, light on resources and the customer service is just exemplary. Whether I contacted them to check authenticity of the version I bought online or to check the issue I had, or installation problems, talking to them was just an out of the world experience. They even follow up and are more eager to please. What else do you need - the best product at a very economical price and a customer service to back it!! That's why its The Best. Period.PS - Will add one more star and be their lifetime customer when they gift me their Dacian Dragon-Wolf figurine."
Gerrit Stubbe,1,5,"Used on 3 PC's for over 3 years and no significant problems. Seems to scan wel, keeps alerting about websites and mail. Rated well in test I looked for. The GUI is not my favorite though."
Valentin Duta,1,1,"After I was infected with VIRUS,  Bitdefender told me that they can not help my.They are horrible!They admitted their mistake an they pay us money back.They preferred to get rid of *us.   ( CLIENT with virus infested )shame on you !!!"
Janet Sechrist,1,5,"I really have a hard time getting around on the computer and your technicians are so patient and get me here I need to go to fix the problem. They are very helpful and patient. Fixed my problems with e-mail, which really helps me because I can keep referring back to the written instructions. Thank you very much."
MMaguire,21,1,"I purchased bit defender on 26 February 2016 and requested a refund on 04 March 2016. Although the website did not ask why I wanted a refund I stated I did not like the user interface and it slowed my PC. On 7 March 2016 they closed my ticket saying the issue was resolved. After not receiving a refund I contacted Bitdefender 23 April 2016 requesting an update. The update, 51 days after I requested a refund, was they acknowledge my request but wanted to resolve the issues. No advice on the refund.Update: After posting this online and sending an email advising I would post similar reviews everyday Bitdefender now advise the money will be refunded within 7 days, a whopping 2 months later with no explanation or compensation. It is a shame Bitdefender only honours its refund policy when shamed into it. Bitdefender, I have a question, out of all the people that request a refund, what % receive it? I am guess a policy of advising a ticket has been actioned but not refunding the money results in a good percentage not following up afterwards.Final Update: Bitdefender has refunded my money but it has taken two months and it only happened by resorting to naming and shaming. As bitdefender hasn't answered my question on the percentage of customers that receive the refund they request I'm guesting there is something to hide. For those that are wondering, no bitdefender did offer or give any compensation."
Dave Welter,1,5,"My computer somehow got into an interesting state that affected how Bitdefender responded that made access to some files difficult.  The Bitdefender tech support was very useful in correcting this situation.  The communication was clear, step by step to work through a series of corrective actions, which involved recovering from an incomplete product removal and a reinstall.  The correct tools to accomplish this were provided in the proper sequence.  All is good again."
Eli Levine,1,5,"I love bitdefender, I use 6 different anti malware tools and bitdefender is definitely one of the best! They're scores on AV-Test.org are always very high and they always detect the viruses on my computer! Thanks so much!!!"
Derron,1,5,"I have, in the past tried many antivirus solutions ,web security, malware and spyware protection and a host of protection for my machines. I have never felt so protected till I made Bitdefender  My total security for my machines...it sees everything! I mean everything. I don't need to get additional software to help protect my system, it does it all, afterall, it'd rated #1. I must say that other software came up pretty good in there protection like kasperky but...the interface that Bitdefender has works so much better with me and the technical support is great, though I didn't get through when I used the ""live chat"", my situation was sent to them by mail and they responded in 24 hours. Well that part could be improved on, nevertheless, compared to others that's a thumbs up.I would recommend Bitdefender to everyone.. It even made my machines faster with their optimization system!..I say no more, download the trial and experience protection like never before."
Ray Williams,1,5,"Before I used Mccaffe and I kept scanning and it didn't detect anything so I tried bit defender and found 5 viruses and 125,000 file issues. After it fixed everything my pc ran a lot faster."
Joseph Luppens,1,5,Bitdefender has always had a great software engine and it's good to know I can get my technical questions answered in a reasonable time frame.
Daniel,4,5,"Bitdefender is an excellent security product, it is consistently rated highest for its detection levels from trusted AV review companies. Purchase was easy with 50% discount on the 'Family Pack' which is excellent value for money allowing unlimited installations managed from one or few bitdefender central accounts. Installation was seamless and fast on both my Macbook Pro and my Windows 10 machine including the installation of extensions for my browsers.Their security suites are packed with features, some reviews comment on the inability to customise, these claims aren't a true reflection of the suites offered as there are a plethora of features that are tweakable.I'm extremely impressed by the online management dashboard known as Bitdefender central as it is again packed with features to remotely perform functions on machines running Bitdefender software and it is extremely easy to use.Other noteworthy experiences with Bitdefender include their Forums, they are a great addition to the knowledgebase and support however this does not replace the tailored support that Bitdefender offers. I'm also impressed with Bitdefender Labs which publishes articles surrounding the IT security industry and specific malware tools.It's worth noting that I'm a returning customer and I haven't dealt with Bitdefender customer service and product support for a while now so I'm unable to comment on that area just yet, however I'd like to hope that they have improved since my last use of their product as waiting times were rather long for email and the replies felt a little scripted.I will continue to use Bitdefender as they seem to be the market leader for detection and thus offer the best preventative measure."
Henk Smith,1,5,With one of my computers was a problem with the installation Anti Virus.Excellent help from the service line in a few days have solved the problem.Answers to my questions were always answered within half an hour.This is the way it should be! 5 stars!
Robin W,5,5,My computer picked up something on Facebook that looked like a ransom bug. I immediately contacted Bitdefender and supplied them with the required info. I believe they sent a patch because shortly thereafter my computer began functioning normally. Thanks Bitdefender!
Bill Drobnes,1,5,Rapid response. Efficient follow-up.
Joe Villella,1,2,"I used Bitdefender for three years. As my term's expiration date approached, I was advised I'd selected the AutoRenew option and given a link to change it. All well and good thus far, but they showed a price with no term (I'd purchased three years previously). I e-mailed asking the term. No reply. A few days later, I deselected AutoRenew and they offered a reduced price, but again no indication of whether it was for one year or more. I opted out and, when prompted, explained I needed confirmation of the term being offered. Again, no reply. Two days before expiration, I e-mailed Support to ask again. No reply. On the day of expiration I called the Support number and the representative wouldn't listed to my question; she interrupted me to tell me what I already knew. I told her I was frustrated with not being listened to and hung up. So now, I'm looking for another product when I'd have been perfectly happy renewing had their customer relations been even moderately competent. As it is, I feel they didn't give a damn about me.Update following Bitdefender's reply: It was nice to get a reply, but I don't have a ""ticked"" ID as nobody ever responded to any of my e-mails and my call with the CC Rep ended before any mention of a ticket/case being logged. And I see no way of contacting you from this site and already tried multiple times through normal channels. I can only wait for your e-mail or phone call."
Barry Middleton,1,5,I have used Bitdefender for many years now and have always been very happy with their product and service. Every contact I have had with them has been promptly responded to in a helpful and friendly manner.
Brett M.,3,5,"I made the jump into the deep and and made the choice to transition from ESET over to Bitdefender when they released the ""Box"" platform that they now offer.While the setup was pretty straightforward I ran into some issues that really messed up my router configuration and my network connectivity. I spent a fair amount of time on the phone with BD customer support, and after some troubleshooting they had me back online.Overall, I am very pleased with this product, and more so with the customer service that BD provided. While this platform does not have the detailed settings that other services has, I have had no issues with malware or phishing attempts on my home network.Thanks for all you do Bitdefender!"
Brede Skorve,1,5,Very good support when you need any help.
Sandra,1,2,"I switched to a different program. I told them twice to cancel my subscription when it tried to auto-renew. It has been weeks of repeating emails, and I still don't have the refund.  😁"
Abdul Hajjar,1,5,"Bitdefender is honeslty one of the best anti-virus programs I have ever used. In the past, I have used nearly half a dozen different anti-virus, and out of all of them, I would rate bitdefender the highest. I got the total security option for 20$ (when it went on sale) and ever since I have had no problems except for one which I contacted customer support and it turned out I was signing in with the wrong email. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product and I would reccomend it over anything else, including Kaspersky, avira, avast, windows defender, norton, and mcafee. I love it! 10/10."
Geet,1,5,Bitdefender has given me their best service from which  I am really happy
STYXX,4,5,"This a company I have dealt with for  many years, And I will tell you why,If you have ever had a virus or hacking attempt you can rest assured That Bitdefender can and will FIX!!!!Simply contact the support staff ,you can do it by email or, I find thatThis is the best way, (CALL, THEM !!! ) yes!!  this is the best way to use The very helpful staff and let them know what your drama is and why Something is not working as it should or that you need to secure anotherDevice eg; LAPTOP, TABLET or IPAD etc: all of witch I have done!!And I can say that I have had maybe 6 really bad dramas in 10yrs or soThat in its self is a very good average!!

David Hansson,1,4,I feel same with bitdefender
Hesham Farahat,1,5,excellent and easy to use interface
Tom,1,5,"I was replacing one laptop with another and wanted to use the same license on the new machine.  I quickly received a response with reference to the appropriate article, which contained clear instructions.  Following the instructions was easy and resulted in a clean installation.  Excellent response.  Tom"
James G Knight,5,1,"See previous posts below  If they can't keep the software activated, how can you trust them to actually be protecting your devices.  Only way to re-activate even if you have an active subscription is to prematurely buy another licenseNew Post: Subscription for 4 devices suddenly deactivated with 460 days remaining.  3 devices lost protection after prolonged effort to get them activated a month ago.  Uninstalling from all devices as I type.  This is product is prepaid RANSOMWARE, don't install and certainly don't trust that it is properly working!!!Prior post: Don't know about the relative quality of the protection, butI had three licensed PCs for about 660 days remaining.  Tried to add a 4th by purchasing an additional single license.  When trying to activate the 4th device, the only option not ""greyed out"" was extend the subscription.  Clicking that resulted in loosing activation for 2 licensed devices, extending the third active device from about 660 days to 990 days, and no activation for the 4th device I was on,  that I was tryin to add?Multiple customer service contacts... ""we'll get back to you"", No JoyHad to remove Bitdefender from the 2 deactivated (unprotected) PCs and go back to Windows Defender which works fine.Customers can't speak to anyone that can help them by phone, chat or email;, only get a promise that they will refer it to someone who can address the problem... never happens X ~10 days.Chat never answers rolling over to an email contact that generates an automatic response, but after email support contact... NOTHING HAPPENS.Given their inability to address a problem efficiently, I am sure they are inundated with unnecessary repeat service requests!"
Victor,1,1,"I bought Bitdefender AV. Due to some error the license key I received by mail did not work. I believe the error message said I should contact tech support, so I did. Now it's been like 10 days and I still haven't received a reply to my support ticket. At this point I think I want a refund instead."
Uncas,2,1,"On 4/4/16, shortly after I tried to uninstall and repair Bitdefender Total Security 2015, my computer crashed to a blue screen (first time ever) when I tried to reboot and I had difficulty restarting it until I finally ran a ‘system restore’ and fortunately, I was able to restart my computer.  My system specs,  OS:  win7 professional, 64 bit, amd fxtm 8 core, 3.6 ghz , 10gb ram.I’ve been running this program since my purchase on 9/17/15 but I couldn’t have been more disappointed than the last few weeks as the slow downward spiral had progressed.  My security reports went from ’well protected’ to those that continually said I had been ‘you are at risk’ and I could not figure out why as I made sure my settings were appropriately calibrated, especially to allow for updates and were even already set on Autopilot as prescribed by the security report. Recently, when I clicked onto ‘fix all issues’ for the main Bitdefender popup page, I got a message saying it failed and the feature (whether it was ‘firewall’ or ’real time file protection’) remained disabled.Flashing back to a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that I was starting to have difficulty opening Bitdefender from desktop. I could not open it unless I rebooted.  This began to get old and I then contacted customer service who told me to go into my device panel/programs and feature to uninstall and repair the program.  This ‘fix’ only worked for so long before Bitdefender reverted to the old ways. Eventually, I could no longer open Bitdefender to run even a basic security scan, check my settings, or security status.   Subsequently, I contacted customer support once again who gave me instructions to send them a SUPPORT TOOL log, an AUTORUNS log, and a screenshot (Bitdefender Support ticket # 2016040420180002). That was over five days ago and I still have received no resolution from Bitdefender.  In the meantime, I have uninstalled Bitdefender and replaced it a ’free’ AV program (Microsoft Security Essentials ) as I needed a stable and more reliable AV program to protect my computer. Thus, I no longer wish to wait indefinitely while customer care continues to use ‘stall tactics’ by telling me to be patient (either because they’re really backed-up feverishly working on other client’s issues due to glitches in their program which may have been compromised or that they’re just totally inept) and with 165 days left on my BTS 2015 subscription, I will ask for nothing less than a full refund to purchase a more dependable product.  Incidentally, a 'one-star' rating is overly generous!"
Judy,1,1,"Update: Re the reply below from Bitdefender Customer Support - why did it take 6 emails to Bitdefender to get a full refund, then a reply from Avangate Shopper Support to get a full refund? It seems that customers are provided the wrong support email when they are looking for a refund. This could've saved me a week and much time to get my unauthorized refund back asap.I saw a charge for $59.95 on my credit card, and I did not authorize this. I called Bitdefender on Sunday and asked for a full refund because I don't have a computer anymore. The rep said I will have a colleague email you. I didn't trust this so I emailed Bitdefender support and asked for a full refund because I don't have a computer. I was offered a discount and to only pay $29.97. I called again and the rep could not help further except to say I will refer you to my colleague who will enail you. He opened a 2nd ticket. I emailed again to follow up and explain that I require a full refund because I do not own a computer anymore. I then received a reply with an offer of only paying $19.95 when Bitdefender had already charged me for $59.95.It has been 5 days since my initial request for a full refund. The phone reps cannot help. The support email reps are trained to try to refund less than the full charged amount if they can get away with it.Every email alert up to this event was in spam. I have not updated Bitdefender as I cannot without a PC and I am still not being given a full refund.Every email I receive which offers me a discount on keeping Bitdefender is a template, see my email and the response:Hi,Can I please get my full refund?On Apr 5, 2016 06:10, ""Bitdefender Support Center"" wrote:Dear,Thank you for contacting us with regard to this pressing matter.

Robert Hockley,8,4,Good price if you look out for special offers. I had difficulties installing but it was probably down to a slow internet connection. Runs well in background without slowing computer. Seems very effective.
Cynthia,1,1,"They are quick to take your money but when the software does not work, I don't care how many support tickets you fill out, they refuse to respond.  I am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and I promise you this....I will get a refund,  I refuse to pay for software that will not work.  They talk a good game with their fancy website but they are all TALK and absolutely NO ACTION.  BEWARE !!!"
Herman Schaap,1,1,"Byer beware,review Bitware complaints.Bitdefender lets you know politely to refund,but no refund.No refund, no business"
Harshaa,1,5,Bitdefender Box is one of the nice things I have came across. It is working wonderfully. Thank you Bitdefender.
Leslie Wright,1,1,"There have been multiple problems with this product.  Previously, I would try to contact the company, but at best, would only receive useless e-mails in response.  Today I witnessed the third ""near death"" experience for my computer.  All the while, Bitdefender was telling me that I was ""fully protected"".  I have actually had better results from free antivirus products.  And Bitdefender has repeatedly nearly cost me the price of a new computer.  Never again."
Jeremiah Rose,1,5,I purchased the new Bitdefender BOX system and thus far it is everything I expected it to be. I ran a few tests on the system myself with a fake virus test code and known malware sites and the system worked flawlessly. Very please with this product.My only gripe is I wish I could find more details in regards to release notes on firmware releases etc.
Corinna Sheridan-Heater,1,1,I've had Bitdefender for a couple of years. Never had an issue until this renewal.  They automatically took $89.95 out of my bank account. I did not authorize this transaction. What's worse is I was only paying $39.95 a year for this product.  I have called since Monday and sent them numerous emails and they keep telling me they are working on my refund.  This isn't a way to keep loyal customers. Especially charging them FULL price!!!
Bird Man,1,1,They will not let you cancel have been dealing with them and my bank for a week. Will continue to charge you and their only response is to offer you 3 free months.
Joshua,2,5,"Very happy so far. I bought 1 Year Internet Security at a great price of $8 off of a third-party website. After realizing that in order to get access to all of the features they have to offer, I would have had to bought the Total Security version. I simply contacted them and they said that they can just take off 60 days of the subscription and upgrade me to Total Security. GREAT deal because they already gave me way more than a year (518 days to be exact. So I got 458 days of Total Security 2016 for 8 bucks. Amazed."
Gary Cheney,1,4,Have had it installed for about 3 months. Quick scans and does not slow system down. Have had issues with auto pilot sticking in Game mode. Have to go to Programs and do a repair which seems to fix it. Does a very good job of blocking unwanted items. At this point I'm pleased with it and would not hesitate to recommend it or buy it again.
Venkat Calidas,1,1,I have 2015 Bitdefender - Strangely it did not install properly and when I discovered this recently I installed it again - BUT the software is unable to BLOCK the websites I as admin set.  I wrote to Tech Support and  the first couple of times the responses came in 2 days. After that the follow up mail has not been responded for over a week. Yet to receive a reply even though I sent all the screenshots as Tech support asked me to. Thoroughly disappointed and plan to ask for a refund. What use is it if it does not do the things it says it will do. Using Windows 10. but I believe that should not be a problem. The guide has screens that are not exactly the same as what IO see in the software (maybe the pics are outdated). I was impressed by the Bitdefender website and some of the reviews and ratings. Sadly my real experience is not that. Regards VC
desertfather,1,5,"We have several computers and both Android and Apple phones/pads. We were searching for one supplier/product that could provide protection for all of our products. Additionally, I am looking forward to getting familiar with the features available to allow my wife and I to control the access to wifi and offer protection for our 13 year old twins. The support staff kept answering my questions and allowed me to identify what I consider the best package for me and my family at a price that did not break the bank."

nan,1,5,"Without a doubt the free anti-virus program Bitdefender is excellent. That being said I would like to offer information pertaining to my recent experience with Bitdefender's Residential Customer Service.I had been having computer issues that I could not reconcile and was ready to throw in the towel and dump the computer.I contacted Bitdefender's technicial engineers who sent me daily emails with explicit directions and links to detect the problem. Shortly thereafter one set of instructions solved my computer issues! Bitdefender's technical support staff are not only extremely knowledgeable, they are also persistent in solving the problem. They offered assistance in non-technical terminology for easy understanding for the layman. I received an email every day so I knew my problem was not at the bottom of a never-ending pile of help requests. I heartily acclaim Bitdefender's support team to be the best there is!"
Jeff Storck,2,5,I managed to acquire some Malware before I got Bitdefender. Their support team were tireless in helping me get rid of it. I highly recommend this virus solution to anyone.

Marton Radkai,1,1,"I have been using Bitdefender since 2013. I switched from Norton, because Norton kept putting me on automatic renewal (it was always well hidden), and I got tired of having some private company suck money out of my Pocket without asking me..So I tried Bitdefender  Antivirus 2013 for 3 PCs. Price was good. I am a home user. It was unintrusive. OK... The autoscan never worked on one computer of mine, but I learned to live with that.Then I installed licence 2 on my wife's PC. It worked well.Problem started recently, when I got two new PCs: One back up for myself (license 3) and one for my wife, her old one bit the dust very suddenly. License  No. 3 had vanished. The BD on my wife's new computer then told me that ""Total Security"" had expired and I had to buy a subscription. Huh??? Subscription? Total Security? The site said: ""Your Wife's"" PC is protected... very strange.SO: I reinstalled BD on my main PC to see what was happening. Shazam!!!1) I now have Total Security , which I didn't ask for. And have to subscribe... (You think government agencies are pests? Try these electronic monsters.... )2) I have Safepay, which I did not ask for. I have NEVER wanted Safepay. 3) I have a window that pops up all the time and interrupts my work: I am supposed to log in with it, but it doesn't work, even after resetting my password. A WWW search shows that I am not alone with this problem. But the ticketing system still wanted a screen shot.4) The ticketer wanted a screen shot.... obviously to put me off for a few days. I sent it, but have heard nothing back (it took two attempts) Great, Bitdefender, you have succumbed to the ""improvement-to-make-more-money-out-of-consumers"" bug. May you drown in bitcoins.If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's only in the minds of some neophile techies that people want NEW all the time. We don't. We want ""function"". OK?I am looking for a new antivirus. Even though I still have two, theoretically three half-used licenses with BD.How sad."

Garry Rush,1,5,I saw BitDefender Rated highest and several antivirus tests - against all of the big names. I was looking to see where the windows free defender and antivirus rated when I saw the BitDefender for the first time. I installed it and have never looked back.Easy to installEasy to registerIt works in the background when I am off of my computerThe tech support is first rate even for the free edition
M. Clayton,2,5,My computer experience goes back to the days of punched cards and computers that filled large rooms. I've had many experiences with software firms and their support staff over the decades and my recent experience with the Bitdefender support folks ranks them right up there with the very best. Well done indeed!
alex,2,5,A good experience with this tool. A lot of options to fiddle with and good detection of threats. Simple to use and a fair price as well. Good customer support as well!
Rosalind Walters,2,5,I have been using Bitdefender since January 2013. So far the program seems to have performed well. I have recently had some issues with my subscription and the new Bitdefender Central method of licensing and think that they should make changes to the system or revert to license keys. I did have considerable delays and frustrations dealing with customer support when each new customer service representative seemed oblivious to the information I had supplied previously. My problem was finally solved to my satisfaction by one particular representative who dealt swiftly and efficiently with my issue and provided excellent customer service.
moshe greenberg,1,5,i heared about yuor anti virus thet it is excelent' but i live in israel and i don't understand english.i beg you to send me in hebrew.thank you very muth
Bruce Garrett,1,4,"I acquired the ""Cryptolocker infection"" (LOCKY Virus).  Tried to contact Bitdefender by chat with no response, sent an email, and finally called.  Told to pull the newtork cable and send an email with details.  Sent three - four emails over several days with no response.  Eventually I did get a response and from that point things moved rapidly.  I was asked to do scans of the computer and send logs back to Bitdefender which I did.  I had also saved the email and the attachment and received instructions on how to safely archive and send the infection to Bitdefender for analysis.I was lucky.  I got the infection stopped, I think by pulling the network cable, before it had finished encrypting everything.  I was able to isolate the computer until I finally got help from Bitdefender.  Based on the post logs I sent the computer should be virus / infection free.  The email and attachment I sent it was found to be a variant that Bitdefender could detect and deal with."
Michael Pedersen,2,5,Great product. Good support service.
harlen mertz,1,1,On 1/19/16 I purchased two subscriptions to Bitdefender Internet Security 2016 for two computers. When I tried to activate the second computer the activation added another year to the first one. Now I have no security on the second computer. I called Bitdefender customer support and told them of the problem. The guy said he would create a ticket and get it taken care of. The ticket number is 20160112019370003. I called again on 1/21/16. this time he said he would expedite it. I received the first email from them on 2/5/16 telling me that I needed another email account and to set up another Bitdefender account. You can't set up another Bitdefender account without purchasing another subscription. I get emails from them about every two weeks telling me there is an open ticket and they are working to get the problem resolved. It is 2/26/16 and they are no closer to resolving the problem than they were the first day I called. I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau. I will also be switching my security software to somewhere else. All these people do is give you the run around.Update 3/9/16: Typical response from Bit defender. I have cancelled my account and moved on from their stupid games!! Maybe you should check this ticket number where I cancelled the account 2016022819450003.
Rushton,1,5,"My Internet Security came up for renewal, so I decided to review my options and looked for a trustworthy application. To my alarm the suite I was using did not crack a mention in the top 10 respected reviews. Bitdefender presented as the best option to me and after completing installation, I was more than glad of my new protection. In the setup scan my old security software started popping up windows suggesting my computer was infected and to contact their service people. This was a bit scary but Bitdefender informed me that it had dis-infected the offending files. Since deleting the quarantined files and uninstalling the old security software, I have had no further problems. The Bitdefender support team has been great too. Their report system has verified that my PC is now clean and protected following up with personal emails to re-assure me.Noticeably my computer seems to be operating better too.I recommend you consider Bitdefender for your Internet Security."
RP,1,1,"I used to love Bitdefender.  Then it stopped working for me with the latest Windows release (a major connection point was blocked & couldn't be resolved - probably more of an issue stemming from Windows).  I was actually bummed about it & contacted them to cancel my auto-renewal.  Ignored!  Then billed anyway!  So I reached out only to receive infuriating responses completely ignoring the fact that I had instructed them to cancel the service.  6 days later, no resolution & no apology!  I just had to open up a Paypal dispute.  Maybe there are some areas that aren’t so bad (years ago I had an amazing experience with their IT help dept.), but after their shady billing practices, I’d stay far away.  Dirty company – should not be trusted with any sort of safety / privacy matters.  Hopefully they straighten out their act – they once had a great product & customer service.  Not anymore.  PS - I am also terribly annoyed by Microsoft & how their software can behave like malware & I'm sure that played a major role in issues with the functional issues I experienced with Bitdefender software BUT I am most definitely not ok with the shady billing practices practiced by Bitdefenfder.  & to think of the hours I spent & $ I paid trying to keep Bitdefender running after the Windows update...ugh!  Sure wish I hadn't!  Not holding my breath for an ethical software company though :(UPDATE: @Bitdefender - Ref. #46912511.  Well, my Paypal dispute & this review actually got some attention.  Bitdefender actually had the audacity to deny the Paypal claim!  Within minutes of that claim being denied by them, I received an update from customer service - ""After verifying your order we have noticed that you have opened a chargeback request with your bank. For any disputed orders we recommend you to contact the bank directly in order to clarify this situation and receive more information.""  Seriously???  How about you authorize the legitimate claim for something you are 110% in the wrong on?  Bitdefender should be ashamed of themselves - they are crooks!"
Robert Riley,2,5,"I have been using Bitdefender products for 4-5 years.  First, I used Antivirus Plus and then, within a year, I switched to Bitdefender Internet Security.  Over those years, I have had to contact customer support several times (usually having to do with a license or subscription issue).  In all cases, those issues were resolved to my satisfaction via my contacting customer support.  I've never known of any security breakdown on a PC of mine which was being protected by Bitdefender."
Michael,1,4,"I have no complaints with the anti virus product, I have used it for years, it has been brilliant.However, I have a significant problem with their business practice of ""Auto renewal"". 1) It is not an option you can deselect as part of the purchase process. It isn't an option at all - it is included and there's nothing you can do about it until AFTER all is completed (by logging in and finding the option... somewhere). 2) It isn't readily visible as part of the purchase. It is hidden away under a footnote of ""continuous protection"". You have to read well into this before you see the first mention of ""auto renewal""; the opening lines sound as you'd expect continuous protection to sound - auto updating and scanning... not auto renewal. 3) The footnote is in subdued colours, outside the payment form and appears unrelated to payments.Points (2) and (3) are at odds with being clear and transparent. Whilst it is there, it's obfuscated visibly and not clear whatsoever - you cannot deselect it; it is not an option - it is forced upon you.As it was, I had already purchased an extra years subscription to Bit Defender TOTAL security (not internet, so an improved product) through another source for less than 50% of the price of the auto renewal they foisted upon me.So great product, heartily recommended. However, awful practice with this auto renewal, do not recommend. Overall, unhappy.*EDIT* - update, Bitdefender have resolved my auto-renewal problem promptly and to my satisfaction. So rating from 3 up to 4 stars based on back to being happy again; disappointing that this happened in the first instance. Disappointing to see it is a common complaint. Suggest Bitdefender review the clarity of the statement in sign up, change it to a tick box that can be selected if desired (or de-selected at that point)."
Daniel,1,5,"I have used Botdefender for many years without problems. With the last upgrade antispam failed to work. But the support team solved the problem, and now antispam is workin again. I would definitely recommend bitdefender!"
Martin Fredriksson,2,1,"The product is ok, but their support is one of the very worst I've ever experienced. There is a bug in Bitdefender (Total Security) 2016, that prevents Visual Studio 2015, ASP.NET 5, IIS to work with with browserlink feature enabled. A number of people have experienced this bug. Sure, this is not the most common use of a computer, and only applies to people using Visual Studio to develop web applications using the very latest (beta) version of ASP.NET. The problem with Bitdefender support is not that they cannot help with the bug, but rather that they COMPLETELY DISREGARD ANYTHING I WRITE TO THEM. They keep on repeating the same request to me, regardless of how many replies I send or what I explain about the problem.I've tried for 4 weeks now, registering multiple support tickets, but I've yet to find a way to get any useful information from them. Their complete lack of service and their completely inability to help me is very disappointing.So, the merged support case is 2016022110180002. That is fine. Bitdefender replies below that I haven't provided any feedback on that issue, which is wrong. They suggested again (for the 15th time in this case) that I do EXACLY THE SAME THINGS I've previously reported didn't work. I again repeated my same answers, explaining why their suggestions didn't work and wondering why they again completely ignored what I've already written. I now have a new suggestion on what to do-- for the first time in this thread they have not just repeated the exact same silly suggestions, so maybe this time an actual human being replied. I'll now test out their new suggestion. Update: their new suggestion works, but as it involves removing a dll file from the installation and disable automatic product updates, I am now waiting for a bug fix. I feel a bit more optimistic now, since they now at least are paying attention to my issue (after more than a month!!!)."
Thomas Pocock,4,5,"I've only had to contact Bitdefender twice for support in the last few years and every time my issue was resolved very quickly. They communicate very efficiently and are extremely knowledgeable about their product.I highly recommend Bitdefender. It is very light and doesn't impact the system's performance, like a lot of other security software does, and it works in the background. Full system scans are thorough and the firewall has some very useful features."
Martin Jay,1,5,I have used this proiduct for about 3 years now and found it a very good internet security indeed. Recently had a problem whereby the 'Safepay' (bank security) on it froze. I contacted Bitdefender who after a few days and me uploading my usage files to them found that the problem was being caused by another Anti-Malware app conflicting with Bitdefender. Bitdefenders guys found the problem with a minimum of fuss and were very thorough giving me the correct links and simple instructions to repair the error.I wouldn't hesitate to use this internet security software again
Mike,1,4,Great followup by Alexandru Evanescu. Very patient and communicated well--and best of all--he resolved installation issue very quickly. Well done!
Ray C,1,5,"good experience with Bitdefender.  Solved problem in a timely matter.  Love the program and protection it gives,  I have had many security programs and services, but this one is outstanding.  I have use for 2 years, still love the protection."
bosung kim,1,5,"I had downloaded documentary avi by torrent.Some documentary avi is difficult to see in my country like Iceroad trucker series.But, I realized that I must pay to treat malware after several days.though Almost vaccines did not find malware, Only Bitdefender found, and removed them.The day after 2014, I always use bitdefender.I feel bitdefender is accutrate program to malware."
Ryan,1,1,Do not use Bitdefender. They will charge you for auto renewal at full price without telling you and they will not refund you. They claimed that they sent me an email telling me that my account was set up for auto renewal but I did not read this email. Terrible customer service.Ticket ID 2016021520350002‏
R. Callahan,1,1,"I've used Bitdefender for the last five years. EVERY time there has been an issue with installation. Great product if you can every get it installed. Customer Service is auto-response and three days later an e-mail. They don't even address the problem you've contacted them about but give you directions that makes matters worse. Product won't install, I was instructed to switch accounts, that made the purchased item expire. They offered an extension of service. I replied why would I want an extension on a product that I can't install from a company that doesn't know what they are doing. Filed with BBB and the European version of BBB. Am waiting for refund."
Essi Rahimi,2,2,"While i think the product is good in itself, if you ever need support from them good luck getting response within a week. I was after adding additional licenses to my account so that i could add devices, but unfortunately and for some unknown reason you need to contact support to do this.  Nevertheless, I waited 8 days and no word from them , even after numerous emails so i called them up and that's when they escalated it. the next day they said they had done it but they confused my accounts and applied the wrong licenses to the accounts, anyway after another 4-5 days and me calling up again to chase up, they finally fixed it. all in all 2 weeks for a simple request."
Frank B. Felty,1,5,"Actually, I thought I had some Spyware on my computer. I contacted Bitdefender and asked the if I had spyware protection and they said yes. I was on another site where is all started. A well known company site when a chat window came up and long story short they ended up trying to sell me spyware protection as they showed I had 2300+ spyware on my computer. I realized that I was being scammed as it was all about selling me spyware protection for $299. I immediately told them know and they quickly closed out of everything. I scanned my computer with my Bitdefender and it showed everything okay. So, I added another spyware only software that my computer tech told me about, ran a scan and I'm okay. Bitdefender techs went out of their way to help me analyzethe problems I thought I had at first. They were really on top of it just in case it was their software that didn't find anything, however, they had no problems. All I can say, you can really trust Bitdefender. It's rated the number 1 security software  for the last 3 years in a row and it's the best one that I have ever had. Don't use the FREE versions as in this day and time you need to make sure your protected and the FREE versions are good, but the paid versions have so much more to offer especially when your dealing with your personal security."
John Hoffman,1,5,"I had used bitdefender for about 2 years, the program did an excellent job for my PC When I upgraded to Windows 10 I had some challenges with downloading the upgrade...the service team did a great job at resolving my issue in a timely manner. Communication was clear and concise."
Cristian Serbanoiu,1,5,"Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone."
Leo Lambert,1,5,Bitdefender has functioned as advertised. When I renewed there was a problem downloading. I contacted the Care Team and they resolved my problem in a courteous and professional way. In fact they followed up to make sure everything was OK. I am very satisfied with Bitdefender and would definitely recommend it.
H. Chang,1,5,I am very satisfied with this company's support.They were so helpful and explained so clearly that I could install this program myself.
Radman Shabanlu,1,5,i've used bitdefender from 2009 till now and will use it because of it's excellent products and excellent support at any time i have any question or problem.
Greg Doucet,1,5,"This product was recommended to me by a family member who has IT experience. I am completely satisfied with the product performance and their response to any concerns I have expressed.Definitely worth the nominal fee, no regrets!"
Raymundo Vidal De Cano,1,5,"It's very easy to use, install and cover all elements in the daily life."
lohigno lohigno,13,5,"Fast scan , detect everything , simple and minimal interface."
Abdul Rahim,2,4,This is one of the best anti virus software I have used
Gordon Guest,1,5,Bit defender caught viruses that other popular virus programs did not.
Rikk Mokotuupu,1,5,"Outstanding customer service, very fast to resolve issues that arise. Unlike other anti-virus software bitdefender doesn't lock down your system resources and try to control what you do with your computer. It's detection rate is way beyond any other anti-virus programs capabilities. I would highly recommend Bitdefender to family & friends."
Huzefa Kagdi,2,5,"BitDefender is the best Internet Security Solution I have used. It does not have much memory footprint (except while updating) and also does not show false alerts, apart from providing the best protection."
Barney,7,2,"This is the second time in 2 years that I needed to call upon Bitdefender 'Care' Support Team.  Dissapointingly the first time it took them almost 2 weeks to resolve a licensing issue which required a series of emails on my part.  Eventually the problem was solved.Surprisingly again this year I have a similar problem.   After paying for my renewal in January for 2016 I was surprised to discover when the 2015 eventually expired I was left unprotected and was asked again to renew my licence.  I immediately logged the problem using there online system and was given a reference number by an automatic email response.  I stressed as they were in the security business they should be aware that my data was exposed and the fault should be dealt with immediately.  After 12 hours I had no response, so I tried their 24/7 chat line.  After trying several times it repeatedly said nobody was available and asked me to email.  I then called the Support team and I was told as this was a particular license issue it needed the attention of another group and assured me they would action my problem and email me. Another 12 hours has elapse and still no email and therefore no security which therefore means no work for me on my PC.The product itself appears to work fine, but I have serious doubts with the licensing system and definitely with the so called support.I have serious doubts whether I will renew next year"
Mac Watt,3,1,"My Bitdefender came up with a ‘Register Your Product’ notice, it has been registered and working my other computer still showing 275 days to go. I contacted Bitdefender with time left until it expired, they registered the email and gave me a ticket number, i contacted them when there was 1 day to go, they said they were busy and would get back to me, It ran out i contacted them 3 more times with no response, it is now 10 days since first registered and still nothing - great support??UPDATE: Ticket No 2016012508200001A day after putting up the ticket number as requested -  5th Feb still absolutely nothing - great service!Bitdefender asked me to send them a screenshot and a support log, this was done but it bounced back as the file was too big for their email box...I let them know it had come back and eventually i received another email this morning ""Please be informed that we are currently working on resolving your Customer Care request, ticket no: 2016012508200001, and will be getting back to you shortly. Thank you for your patience.""25th Jan to today 15 days is this the most drawn out or do know better?They have contacted me i have replied and still no resolution - now 17 days for a simple problem what chances for a complex one?We are now 22 days into this simple problem and Bitdefender are still sending me:"" Please be informed that we are currently working on resolving your Customer Care request, ticket no: 2016012508200001, and will be getting back to you shortly. Thank you for your patience.""Patience i need to be a saint, unable to use internet on main computer for the best part of a month..."
Barbara Kappelman Brown,1,5,I contacted customer service live chat and the problem I was having was taken care of immediately.
David Evans,5,1,I explained to Bitdefender that I had received a virus via email and someone was sending emails from my account.  I changed the password and asked for a check and a clean as I has a virus. I put my USB in a fiends pc who agreed that I could check and it showed a trogan that allow access by hackers. Result Bitdefender said my computer was clean and not to worry.  Dissatisfied I went to microsoft who checked it with free antimalware available on the internet.  Result nearly 950 minor threats and 11 serious threats.  Bitdefender response was well you downloaded the software and this makes it legal and our antimalware does not pick it up. So why does a companys antimalware  that you pay for not pick up trojans and viruses?Poor response from what is suppose to be the number one company with very poor customer service.  They know they are leaders so why  bother when they fail customers who trust their product.The ref is 348230zip2016010716130001Thank you Bitdefender for your reply.  I do not have a copy of the conversation I had with microsoft as a second trier tech worked on my pc cleaning it for four hours.  My number is SRX132884461D  the case is still live as they did not finish cleaning as I ran out of time.  Now I have found a worm on my pc with has caused the bluescreen damage.My pc is down completely again how can your scan miss all this.  I can give you permission to talk to microsoft about my case all you have to do is quote the above number I can forward my consent.
Customer,4,2,"I had Bitdefender Total Security 2015 on my PC and received a auto-renewal notification from Avongate customer services , who manage the auto renewal process for Bitdefender at the end of December with what boils down to an automatic stealth price hike to £53.95 for this year.I was not happy, did some Security software googling and decided to switch to Bulldog on a 3 year deal for about the same price.I instructed Avangate and Bitdefender to stop the auto renewal and delete my Bitdefender account.Bitdefender offered me a deal to keep me as a customer of a 50% reduction!  (-£27)! These guys do not want you to leave and cling on like glue. Prepare for email tennis.I have now left and will not return. There are too many large businesses who operate this sharp market practice of hiking up the renewal price for existing customers and then offering reductions when caught out. My advice, leave.While Bitdefender may be a leader in PC security but their customer care is rubbish, there are many other good products out there, check them out.I find Bulldog faster, less intrusive and I'm very happy I switched."
Jim McGill,1,2,"I had an automatic one year renewal for the 2016 Internet Security and received a 30 day Trial instead after paying 79.95. Here is a sample of the conversation with Bitdefender: I have had multiple chats with Constantin Tinca, Alexandru D, Lucian P. ,  concerning inability to download the full 1 year subscription of Internet Security 2016. I have been told by Lucian P. Lucian P. (08:07:09) : Alright James, I see here that the ticket was set to the highest priority to add the subscription in the central account. I have informed my supervizor about the ticket. He will make a supervizor escalatation on the ticket in order to modify it right away. In the shortest time possible, you will see that those 30 days were modified and you will see your normal subscription. Since my supervizor will handle it it will be a lot more faster than 24 hours. This was last Friday. In a chat on Monday, I was told that the TEAM was working on the problem and by Thursday it would be resolved. These are some of the many automated responses that state ""RESOLVING YOUR ISSUE(S) AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE. I now have 22 DAYS LEFT FOR SOMETHING I PAID A ONE YEAR SUBSCRIPTION. And this was from Radu Mihail  Bitdefender Support Team 1/23/2016.WILL SOMEONE DO SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If nothing is done in the next day, I will ask for A REFUND!!"
bandit,1,2,Based upon web reviews I decided to purchase the Bitdefender total security 2016.  I purchased the program on the companies website.  I have tried to install it but it doesn't work.  I sent an email to customer support on January 25.  It is January 27.  Only response was assigning a ticket number.  Chat not available.  Doesn't state when chat is available.  I need customer support.
Θοδωρής Μπιντάκας,1,5,"It helped me the last few years to keep my pc and my smartphone,safe... I recommend it to anyone who wants an extremely light on ram , total, and powerful antivirus!!! And if you have any questions,suggestions or concerns, the support team is the best!!!!  Keep up the good work guys!"
Johan,1,1,"Although BitDefender detects almost anything suspicious, I hate to say it but although I, as an administrator have switched of antivirus when I know something is not a virus, it STILLL removes it! I switched off EVERYTHING! I have uninstalled the antivirus now because of how invasive it is..... They need to do something about this! I exclude the virus (its a false positive virus), then it gets blocked again and removed..................... DO SOMETHING! I have to go on the antivirus atleast EVERYDAY to use it. Because if its blocked or deleted, I can't use it... I only wrote this review because I switched off the ENTIRE ANTIVIRUS and switched off firewall, antivirus and STILL  it blocks the virus. I find that super sketchy and hard to understand why..."
Frank,1,5,We've had Bitdefender Total Security for 3 years now and have been completely satisfied with its effectiveness. The product was easy to install on my desktop and the support staff were readily available when I needed them to do it on our laptops.
Aileen,1,5,"I was having trouble with my email delivery which was no fault of BitDefender. Chat line helped to download Bitdefender with persistence and patience until the problem was solved. I now have BitDefender OK. Another company failed to care and seemed to not understand at all. I wasn't able to get their program working although I had paid 2 months before. I am happy with Bitdefenders customer understanding, which I believe is so important."
Don J.,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for quite a few years. In that time I have had no problems that it did not take care of. Twice I contacted customer service with questions and both times they walked me through my issues till they were resolved, in short they were excellent! I would recommend this product to everyone!"
Marco,1,5,It's the best antivírus I've ever used.
Erling Dalsgaard Christensen,1,1,in the last 2 day i have contact to the support and talked to 4 people and no one had fixed the issues about the activation link coded to my account and i dint get my activation key or the right mail for my account yet .i feel you rip me of my money and guess what those 4 people that talked to me on phone cut not understand me because they was not from uk support where i called to this is not how things works in 2016 you need to handle the support with people that can understand english when they call to the UK support number!!!i will never tell anybody to get bitdefender because i need to defend my money instead of getting the best virar in 2016 they should go for kaspersky that we do understand !!!!TRIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this is still the grave diggers place at there support im not on full version 28/1-2016 even after my order was payed 18/1-2016BITDEFENDER is crappy supported ViraI CANT EVEN GET MY MONEY BACK they steal from you and dont do anything about the issue you have i have now 10 days left on my trial even i payed for the full version at 18/1-2016 and still on trial WTH is this?i can tell i am feeling im been scamed big time and they dont give any responds on anything
Piotr Kaźmierski,1,2,"Even though there have been many versions of Bitdefender Internet Security, there still are multiple problems which Bitdefenders ignores, like inability to choose language during installation (the appropriate instaler has to be downloaded) or inability to ignore some of the false positives or problems with migrating to new product versions or very slow UI. Bitdefender ignores these issues or makes them even worse. It may be an effective software, but it doesn't adress power users' needs, even after years of asking for them."
alan,3,5,I have tried most and have had Bitdefender for a number of years and never had any issues with security everThe support is second to noneBitdefender is highly recommended to protect you and your dataNo question
Roshan,1,5,"I am using bitdefender antivirus for mac, and proudly to say that it is one of the best antivirus software right now and nothing special to say about bitdefender because millions of people are using it from a long time and they know how its works… keep it up bitdefender team and make it simple as possible.Try to put some firewall and internet security future in mac antivirus software otherwise may be you will lose your current position what you have now!!!."
perry rutledge,1,5,tech set up was very good computer runs faster than before set up
Steve Casey,1,5,"I had some problems installing an updated version of Antivirus.  Their customer service worked with me until the problem was fixed.  With their help, we drilled down to find and eliminate the problem.  I can't say enough good things about their customer service.  Their product has always worked for me and hasn't let any malware or viruses through to my system."
T.Heiniger,1,4,"Bitdefender is probably the best anti-virus Program. Only one thing could be better. It should be possible to disable the program for a view minute, if this is required, for exemple during the installation routine of a program. Why is this not possible?But I still recomend it as a very good antivirus program."
Kamie Fulton,5,5,"I feel that Bitdefender is the best antivirus, etc...We have been using Bitdefender on our computer for about 4 years now.  We had 3 different occasions where our computer had been attacked with viruses and each time it cost us over $250.00 to fix.  Since we have been using Bitdefender we have had no issues with our computer.  Bitdefender continues to catch all kinds of issues that could have attacked our computer.  I have also, been using it on my tablet for over 2 years and have never had an issue.  Their Customer Care Team has also, recently helped me with figuring out an issue I was having in getting Bitdefender for my tablet and they were experts of excellence!  I would recommend this company to anyone for their computer, tablets or phones!  They are THE BEST!"
Martin Pilkington,3,5,"Bitdefender is very easy to use, and has kept my computers safe for about 3 years now. The interface is very easy to use and it is very easy to find the sections that you want. I am now on Total Security 2016 and while the main screen has changed I have found no problems in getting used to the new layout. But the main reason for using Bitdefender is that it works."
Bruce Lucas,1,5,"I had some serious problems that a standard scan that Bitdefender was not able to resolve.After speaking with a customer service rep., he set me up with a Technical Engineer for a ""Remote"" session.ALEX, the Engineer on my session (which lasted for literally hours..) helped to completely remove and resolve every issue that plagued my system.His professionalism, knowledge, ability, patience, time and absolute dedication to resolve all of my system issues was truly the best and most outstanding experience that I have ever had with either a Technical Support Engineer - OR - a Customer Service Rep. Having dealings with the public myself, I must say that the exemplary experience I had with both their reps and engineer speaks volumes as to the integrity and dedication of the Bitdefender Company.Thank you.Bruce Lucas"
Antonio Nicolaas Teyken,8,1,"Bitdefender quarantined som of my system files and refused to restore them, had to reinstall system."
Stephane Beaufils,3,5,"Hi I can honestly say that, for me, Bitdefender total is quite the best protection I have had ever since I stated with computers... (My first was a Tandy) ...Have always downloaded from not too trust worthy sites (to test a product prior to its legal acquisition) ...And, before Bitdefender had to clean for hours after infected files corrupted my computers... Now I rest assured that this product Safeguards’ me 99.9% of the time...I love the product so much that have been promoting it to all around me...I'm the go to guy at work, with family and friends when someone needs to upgrade, install or fix computers... After every job I strongly recommend that they buy and install Total security on their computer...Without exaggerating, I have installed Total security on approximately 30 different computers since 2014...And no one of these machines have ever came back to me with a serious virus....Thanks Bitdefender...."
Barry,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for about 3 months and it works well in notifying me if there is a problem with a website or sometimes just blocking it. Its scans are not a resource hog and I can work during them without a problem. When I did have a problem, their support team contacted me within a couple of hours and the problem was resolved within 24 hours-great service!I'm looking forward to using Bitdefender for many years to come."
Joe Murphy,10,1,"I've dealt with Bitdefender for over a year & I've found they do NOT give customers any support. They do answer emails with auto response & then a week or two later will make some token response then you will get more mails "" please bear with us we're working on your problem"" but alas I've found this is just bluster. I've un-installed their cover with ten months left & requested a refund but all I get is the reply "" we're dealing with resolving your problem"" I've a feeling my message to Bitdefender is ""lost in translation""!!!After Trustpilot published my review of Bitdefender I was contacted by the company & they did apologise for their shortcomings as well as refunding my subscription in full.So I must acknowledge their attempt make amends for my negetative experience."
Kratochvil Pavel,1,5,A very good Program and good Support in case of Problems. I recommend!
Joyce S Szurgot,1,5,State of the art - actually ahead of the curve and good value to be internet safe.
Αναστάσιος Μάνεσης,1,4,I use Bitdefender for 5 PC for more than 2 years and it is οne of the best I've ever used

george robinson,5,5,"bitdefender 15 was not functioning correctly, contacted support & despite being xmas holiday period, received response immediately.1 day later received fix which was free upgrade to 16. no praise too high for the team at bitdefender.  highly recommended."
Joel Christie,1,5,"I really appreciated how Bitdefender Support kept communicating when their first suggestions did not solve my problem, We kept communicating until we solved the problem I was experiencing"
Helena Hamilton,1,5,"Competent-Pragmatic: Bitdefender will resolve security issues efficiently.  Also, it is committed to keeping your computer updated and optimized."
Peter,1,5,"Bitdefender is the best product from all I have used... easy installation and settings, friendly menu, comprehensive features..."
Helen Szabados,1,5,"Have been using Bitdefender on Windows and Android devices for years. Protection seems effective, load on my devices is minimal and upgrades are simple. 2016 Total Security is my current version."
Stanley Hannaford,2,5,"I have been using Bitdefender on 2 computers for a number of years. I find it has always kept me safe from viruses, malware and any other intrusions and the Autopilot system means I don't have to worry about checking for updates etc.The one time I had a problem it was resolved easily by email with the customer service department.I would unreservedly recommend Bitdefender to anyone!"
TB,1,1,"Bitdefender ignored multiple requests regarding auto-renewal on my account (I did not wish to auto-renew) and charged me anyway. I had several interactions with them regarding this issue and they just told me it would be taken care of and renewed it anyway. This shows a callous and indifferent approach to customer service and I will never do business with them, personally or professionally, again.UPDATE: After sending my ticket info to BitDefender in response to the message they wrote below this one, they have still not refunded my money and do not provide updates regarding the status of my ticket, even when asked.2016011515030002"
Nikos,1,5,Very satisfied from the security pacage and specially from the customer support.
Ken Rucker,6,5,Having used and programmed PCs since before PC/MS-DOS I have used all of the security products on the market.  After arriving at Bitdefender for the first time about 3 years ago I can not imagine going back to any of the others.  By all measures Bitdefender outscores all competitors by large margins.
Luís Martins,1,5,"I've been a satisfied customer for about 4 years now and my laptop, PC, and all my cellphones and tablets were never infected by a vírus. Best I've ever seen or experienced. Thank you."
Courchinoux Francis,1,5,I got all the help that I needed
Karl Coulby,1,5,"I'm very pleased with the value and service I've received from Bitdefender and the customer service team. They have gone out of their way to help me solve an issue that I had and the product itself is excellent. I've tried Macafee's and Kapersky and I find Bitdefender a far superior product. I've also had the misfortune of dealing with Kaperskys customer services reps, an arrogant bunch who had no wish to help me at all, apart from in a smug and condescending way. Completely the opposite of the kind support I received from the Bitdefender team.An excellent product all around."
Roman Protsiuk,1,5,Very good antivirus for Mac. Does it's job perfectly and I hardly even notice it.
Shirley,1,5,I worked in the Computer Industry back in 1974 when the power we have on our desks would take up a whole house.  I find Bitdefender is the most professional organization and think it is great that they take the time to treat their customers like people when answering questions or solving problems.
Anthony Woodford,1,5,Thank you for Bitdefender
B. Desiderio,1,5,"I am a Bitdefender (Mac) customer since a couple of years. I never had any problem with the product. Recently, I had an issue for which I had to contact the support team. It all went very smoothly. Fast replies to my emails, daily follow-up of my problem, it was really a great experience. Many thanks to the Support team !"
Ross,1,2,"Hello guys I would like to share my experience with Bitdefender.Before December 31 of 2015 I had more than 170 day left to expiration. After 31st it changed to 31 days.So I tried the live chat but it did not work. So I sent an email on the 6th of January 2016 asking them Why the expiration day changed. Today 1/11/16 I got a respond:“Thank you for contacting us with this issue.In order to troubleshoot the issue you are encountering please send us the following:1. A Support Tool log;2. A screenshot of the error message that you receive.”I seriously don’t know what this has to do with the expiration date change.And by the time I finish emailing the customer support.  I will end up buying new one. It is pure cheating!  I see it as customer fraud! Please let me know if any of you had that problem with the expiration date. Thank you,Ross"
ralph,1,5,you just need to make sure you remove old version before updateing
Martin,10,5,"It's very fast and effective, but hardly seems to use my cpu. I will keep using Bitdefender Total Security and really recommend it."
Per Friberg,9,5,Have saved my day more then once.
Rich Mellor,8,4,"I have installed BitDefender after using the sluggish Norton 360 for a few years, followed by 2 years of McAfee.BitDefender seems to have less impact on the smooth running of your PC, and according to magazine tests, is top of its field for stopping viruses.The password manager is much better than that provided by Norton or by McAfee (since they switched to Intel True Key - the latter is only a beta product with lots of bugs).  It is less intrusive than either Norton or McAfee and unlike those works with the latest Firefox!However, the Bitdefender password manager still has its issues :1) my two computers have not synchronised the data between the password managers over 3 days!2) the password data is stored locally on each PC (rather than on the cloud as with McAfee and Norton), so the synchronisation is an absolute must - you also need to ensure all your computers are on at the same time!3) the password manager treats https urls different to http, so will only complete data for one of them unless you store your passwords against both variants of the url4) there is no way of importing password information from other password managers (eg by CSV file) which is a real pain when switching from another product!"
Gregory Beaumont,1,5,I have been using Bit Defender for a few years now and never had any issues up until about 2 weeks agoI contacted the team at BIt Defender to have the issue fixed I was assuming it be a few days to get a reply but within hrs I had a reply and they took care of the problem instantly I wound not hesitate to advise other people to purchase this product The teams is fast and can get things done quick
Rick Siegert,7,5,"I own Bitdefender Total Security. I fix problems on friend's computers, and have cleaned up a lot of virus infections. Other AV software just isn't as good. I've been using Bitdefender for several years now, and recommend it to everyone that uses a windows PC. It has a small footprint (it is hardly noticeable in operation), unless I'm running a full system scan, and then it still doesn't affect the system much."
Adán López Lacayo,1,5,I really feel like I am in the best hands when it comes to the protection of my laptop.
Gmp1010,2,5,"Have tried several different brands to keep our computers clean and protected; for mymoney, this one is the best!"
Andrea Robinson,3,5,"Bitdefender consistently rates as #1 and their protection services are second to none - literally. What's more, they have a very responsive customer service department and can help you with any issue on your computer. I've been using them for 2 years and they're the best I've used. Also, they don't mark every little cookie as a virus like Panda did, and they don't interrupt your computer or slow it down like other programs I've used."
Mark Devereaux,1,5,"When i have had the need for tech support from Bitdefender they have always been courteous, prompt and helpful."
Slavomír Vidhold Slavomír,1,5,Very good! No problem BitDefender!
Assia,1,5,"I've had Bitdefender for over 2 years and so far have had no problems with my computer, unlike before with other antivirus programs.Top notch!"
Harvey Greif,1,5,"Bitdefender runs seamlessly in the background silently protecting without chewing up system resources.  I have had various files blocked to protect my system, mostly tracking cookies but other issues as well.  Nothing has ever damaged my system with Bitdefender protecting me.  I love the tools to clean and optimize my computer too and use them on a regular basis to keep my computer running as best as it can.  I have recommended this program to others and will continue to do so."
Michal,1,3,"Software is great as long as you will have any issue. You can contact support, after 5-6 days you will receive an email that they are working and you will receive the answer as fast as possible. Unfortunately, answer is around 10-14 days from client email. If you have additional question or something is still NOK, you will wait one more time 10-14 days...UPDATE:Dear BitDefender Team, I asked your support for simple manual change on my BitDefender Central account. If you can check my ticket 2015120213130001, I will be very grateful."
Hans Mol,4,5,My only problem was the English language. My language was Dutch. My Windows 10 was Dutch. My computer knowledge was poor.But the Bitdefender crew succeeded in solving my problems.
Mary,1,5,"I have used BD for a number of years, and have appreciated the 24/7 availability of assistance. I am currently dealing with a problem experienced since I upgraded to 2016 Multi Device, but I have full confidence that they will figure out the problem and fix it. I would (and have, and do) recommend BD to friends, family, and everyone."
Nikola Mraovic,1,5,"Bitdefender free is a simple, lightweight but still very effective antivirus. I highly recommend it."
Barry Smith,1,5,"Apart from the fully comprehensive cover that Bitdefender Total Security 2016 gives my laptop against all the dangers that can attack a computer, this company and the service and support they give their customers is second to none. I have had a couple of minor problems and as soon as I have contacted them, they have got straight to work resolving them. They keep me constantly informed of the progress regarding the problem and are always extremely polite when they do so. If you get one product in 2016, you wont go wrong by making it this one."
Thomas Chaney,3,5,"I don't have many computer problems which I cannot solve myself. However, once in a while (1 0r 2 times a year) I am hopelessly baffled by a problem. Bi Defender has fixed these in almost the blink of an eye. I have great confidence and peace knowing Bi Defender is available for these moments when problems are beyond my skill level."
Charles F,4,5,Spent quite a bit of time researching best AV and internet security package for me. Bitdefender was the clear winner and am pleased with its interface and the way it scans when system is idle. Would recommend to anyone. who hasn't decided which one to go with.
Linde Vdm,10,1,"First of I'm Dutch but they don't have a Dutch helpdesk so on the website I get refered to an English or German helpdesk. I don't mind talking in English if this may solve my problem.Had a box that i bought in a store. When I tried to fill in the code, it did not work. Then I mailed with Bitdefender for 3 weeks (it took very long to get a anwer from them). In the end they said we can't help you, go to our French site and ask your question there. They could just ask their French colleagues themselves. I can't explain my problem in French..."
Rian,1,5,The best Internet Security
Steve S.,1,5,"I recently purchased Bitdefender Total Security 2016 because pcmag.com concluded, through their extensive review process, that it is the best antivirus suite available at this time.  I concur.  I formerly used Norton 360/Norton Security Suite, which was provided free by my ISP.  I also used Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Premium, Malwarebyes Anti-Exploit Premium, SuperAntispyware Pro and Zemana AntiLogger.  But after switching to another ISP, Norton vanished during a restart.  Before choosing Bitdefender I first tried Avira Free, then AVG Free.  Avira made exceedingly heavy use of system resources, and AVG broke Windows Defender.  Therefor I needed an antivirus solution with a 2-directional firewall, which Norton 36 had and Bitdefender has.When I purchased Bitdefender I also purchased Install and Setup, which was discounted from $40 to $32.  With Install and Setup a technician took control of my computer and removed all traces of the antivirus/antimalware applications I had been using (more about that later).  I especially liked that he would hover the mouse pointer over items (such as sysinternals) long enough for me to see what he was doing.  Similarly, he allowed time for me to notice that he had typed appwiz.cpl into the Run box before he pressed Enter.One of the valuable tools in Bitdefender is Vulnerability Scan, which scans Windows and applications that need to be updated.  This didn't seem to work entirely properly though, in that it reported that I was using an earlier version of Firefox browser, instead of the then current v42.0.  That was not correct, however.  The version reported by Vulnerability Scan was the version I had first installed, but Firefox had  since updated itself.  That was why I contacted Customer Service (CS).  That was when things got interesting, and CS really had to dig deep.CS instructed me to download supporttool_2015.exe, run it and attach the generated archive and a screenshot of the problem with Firefox I had reported.  Their email also included links to step-by-step instructions and even a video, I believe.  Unfortunately, supportool_2015.exe wouldn't run, and a System Error message was generated, so I ran the Support Tool from within Bitdefender 2016.  The archive it generated was only briefly on my desktop, then it disappeared with a message in Bitdefender to the effect that it had been uploaded to the Bitdefender cloud servers for analysis.  I did, however, attach a screenshot to my reply to the CS email.  CS reported back that the System Error message was due to a Windows C++ Redistributable that was broken, and they provided detailed instructions for me to correct that.  So I followed the instructions for correcting the C++ Redistributables, then ran supporttool_2015.exe.My next email from CS told me that after analyzing the information I had sent to them they concluded I was running Symantec (Norton), which could affect the proper funtioning of Bitdefender.  This came as a surprise to me, and was disconcerting, since I felt the technician who performed Install and Setup should have spotted it.  In any event, I followed the CS instructions to remove what was left of Norton (probably in the registry) and to repair Bitdefender.  The only thing CS failed to tell me was that Windows needed to be restarted following repair of Bitdefender, but Bitdefender informed me when I tried to run another Vulnerability Scan.  When I did so Bitdefender correctly identified my version of Firefox, the even newer version which had been released in the interim, and vulnerabilities in three other applications.By the way, the Vulnerability Scan doesn't just report which version you have and which version you should have.  It also reports the severity of the vulnerability and the things, in detail, an attacker would be able to do."
Al T.,1,3,"Bitdefender does its job of providing (at least a sense of) security, and unlike other antivirus programs, this one doesn't seem too taxing on system resources; however its user experience could be better. I'd prefer the user interface to be more intuitive so that I can spend less time reading the documentation on how to use it and the purposes of all the features. I also had to contact technical support to get the license to work properly, something that should be intuitive enough that such action should never be required.I also installed an Android version on my mobile device, but I'm not even sure it's working properly...so that can be improved."
Myron,1,4,I started the process with an email contact and when I had not received a response after 2 days I called to find out what was going on with my service request.  The hold time was much less than I expected (which is why I started with an email contact instead of a phone call)My problem was promptly fixed.  The follow through emails came promptly.  I thought they should have closed the ticket immediately when the problem was solved but they kept it open to check on follow up difficulties and since I did have an additional problem related to the initial installation problem I was glad they did.  That problem was also solved quickly and they sent additional follow-up emails to make sure everything was working properly.
Richard Thibodeau,1,5,"I absolutely love the ease and thoroughness of Bitdefender. The autopilot mode zaps all incoming threats without ever prompting me for permission(why would my permission ever be needed for that). And it automatically switches to ""Game mode"" when I'm gaming. Easy to use, and thorough---that's Bitdefender(the silent threat assassin)."
Mit Z,2,5,"Yes!! Definitely an all rounder. Does its job, silent, unobtrusive and very efficient. But overall design/UI can be better. There are many other antivirus products that score only on the design perspective. Ideas can be grabbed from them. Also, with regard to my recent issue(websites redirecting), I had contacted Bitdefender. Though the Cs Care gave me a solid solution, it involved installing two other third party software's. (adwcleaner and Adblock Plus). I have installed the bitdefender Traffic Light too for added protection. But why not integrate those in Bitdefender itself. Why install third party softwares to keep my system clean. Bitdefender product should be a complete security suite. I'd have to install other software's to make it a total security?? That's funny.. calling their product Total Security. They need to provide links to other 3rd party software's too i guess to make it a Bitdefender Total Security Suite. I think that needs to be looked into."
Brian Wall,2,5,Over many years I have tried them all and for me Bitdefender has been good value and are quick to send emails helping out with any problem.
Carl Rice,1,5,This is a terrific program that catches the occasional problem embedded through routine use.  It quarantines and eliminates problem files.  I highly recommend its use.
Henk Schuijt,5,5,Bitdefender delivers very good products and gives a perfect support
MariusD,1,5,By the far the best antivirus ever
Winston Smith,2,5,"Being a full blown Geek since before the name existed I have always strived to have the best available for my many computers. Years of using Norton lead me to search for a like product but less obtrusive than Norton and Bitdefender surpasses Norton in every possible way. I would not only recommend this product to anyone I would do my best to convince them that this is the best choice on the market. Autopilot mode keeps me safe without any bother and not only does not slow my equipment down it ""learns"" my usage patterns to actually speed up my system."
Ken,1,5,"Prompt response. Customer Service Officer (CSO) obviously highly competent. Excellent step-by-step instructions given to fix the issue. CSO clearly understood the particular computer platform I was using and the associated OS and Browser. CSO fully understood the relationship between the Desktop computer and the External HDD I use and how Bitdefender could be optimally used in relation to both. Now and again, across the entire internet, you come across an experience with a CSO where the service is genuinely excellent - this was one such case with my interaction with Bitfdefender Support recently."
Lyle,1,5,"Personal computers are a part of everyday life for many people. It helps you in so many ways, especially when using the internet. But there are also dangers out there, namely viruses. So one should be diligent in keeping ones security up in an effort not to be invaded by one. I'm not as security conscious as I should be, and that's where Bitdefender comes in. All you have to do is install the program, and it works silently in the background, I do not have to remember a thing. It updates itself, and provides protection constantly with me doing anything! And that is the FREE version. I would recommend Bitdefender to any and everyone."
Mike,1,5,I recently bought Total Security 2016 and I am amazed by the versatility of the program. I already suggested it to a friend and he's also very happy with the purchase. 10/10 would recommend.
Joe Swafford,1,5,Had a problem with my Bitdefender license and they corrected the issue in about 3 days.  Great product and great service.
Steen Selvejer,1,5,"A stellar ant-virus software for Mac - and a stellar support team to back it up: Prompt responses and competent problem solving in no time. And did I mention, that the guys at the support team are so nice, friendly, helpful and resourceful?Recommended!"
Dale Gildemeister,2,5,Bitdefender has been the Total Security program of my choice for a few years now and I do recommend it and install it on many of my customer's computers.
Cathy Martin Tatum,1,5,"Once everything was confirmed it went super. I love this company they take care of their customers. It was my mistake to start with, I purchased Bitdefender 2016 for licenses for up to three computers, I really needed more but, You know how that story goes!!!. I just so happened to look on the next page a few days later and for about 8 to ten dollars more I recieved the family pack for all the computers in my house. It couldn't have came at a better time. Thanks Avangate {Bitdefender}"
Jonathan,4,5,"Had a few issues that were found by the software but could not be deleted or quarantined....customer service gave me patient, detailed instructions to fix, plus thorough followup to be sure it was resolved.  Extremely helpful and pleasant.  Highly recommended!"
J. Hoss,13,4,The Software itself is an excellent piece of must have kit. The only thing to mention is the massive delay in receiving the confirmation email with the link to install the software.After completing the purchase of the product it says you will be receiving a confiramtion email with the link to install the software within the next minutes. Should this not be the case check your email settings and make sure their email is not blocked. If this is not the case contact your email provider as there maybe a setting from their side blocking the email. As neither was the case I contacted customer support who confirmed my purchase and send me an email within the next 5-10 minutes with the link to install and activate the product. So this worked well why did it not in the first place. The email I should have received immediately after the transaction was completed was in my mailbox the next morning.I would have given 5 stars if the whole process would have gone as smooth as you'd expect it to.
Stevie Miller,2,5,"I was reading reviews 99.5 said it works great.Youtube showed it's at the top of the internet security list.So I had to give it a try,they were right it work great.I really like Safepay,Vulnerabiliity scan and Bitdefender wallet.I would buy it again next time around without a second thought.I fill safe when I'm ordering off the internet."
Uta,18,5,Bitdefender has a highly efficient system in all respects.
Mahmoud Ismail,1,5,"From Egypt,I am using Bitdefender products since 2004, really really wonderful antivirus I love Bitdefender :)"
Hans-Jurg Buchi,1,5,As a user for many years I can definitely recommend Biddeffender to all computer and smartphone users.Best answering service. Prompt email with all info andEasy explanation to follow.Thank guys you are awesome.
John Lawrie,1,5,"I had trouble transferring bitdefender from one laptop to another, I contacted customer care and their service was second to none, I also think that its the best security system I have ever installed."
Bruce Smith,1,4,"I am a Bitdefender user that had a hard time with product set up so I called the help number and got a person that did not help me at all and was quite sharp with me. I hung up and tried again and got someone else and that person was nice to me. Also, I loaded up Bitdefender with Windows 10 and it let a virus through and got implanted in the Bitdefender user window. This virus wiped my hard drive clean and I had to have a new hard drive installed. After we reinstalled Windows 7 Bitdefender seems to be working well. Please be careful using windows 10 because it has security holes in it."
Peter  Dunn,4,5,"I did not come to Computing until in my 60s and lately have experienced problems with a Trojan which caused me to become paranoid and I sought help from the BitDefender Total Security product and associated support teams who have been exceptionally patient and helpful to me on my own terms.  I have tried to respond to BD's requests for information about my problems and I perceive changes in my computer's behaviour which I attribute to BD's competent work 'behind the scenes'.Allowing that the detailed help and care which I have received and am still receiving from this Company is typical of their business approach then I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending it for its honest, patient, straightforward, friendly and competent care by undoubted experts."
Ray Maselli,1,5,I have found bitdefender to be very trustworthy and good on service. I have found the product to be superior to the other four that I have tried.Consequently I have renewed again because they seen to be the best at protection resulting in less downtime on my computer.Would definitely recommend them.
Yuliyan KERAY,1,5,Bitdefender Total Security protects my computer very good!
Peter Davies,3,5,"Although you have to trust that any virus protection software, whether its on a PC or Mac, is up to date with the 'opposition', I've no reason to suppose that Bitdefender is anything other than just so. My experience with the customer service was exemplary; prompt and thorough with explanations. They directed me to places on my computer I never knew were there and having sent a couple of deeply hidden files, explained what it all meant. I also learned from their customer services that my back-up disk (LaCie) needed to be excluded from the virus scan as it's 'protected' and was unnecessary; they explained how to do this. Without doing this the software was struggling and I reported this to them. If I had any suggestion therefore it would be to incorporate an in-scan warning to identify this issue. Apart from that, top marks to Bitdefender."
Balaji,1,5,"I formatted my laptop and I when tried to reinstall bitdefender, I found my CD is misplaced and I couldn't reinstall. I contacted customer service and they are really great in helping me out. They were quick to resolve my issues. I am happy that I got it reinstalled. Thanks bitdfender team. Good Job."
Maureen Rehg,1,5,"I called to verify that I needed to update my internet security. Alex helped me find the answer and was very helpful in walking me through the steps. I soon called back because I wasn't sure if I had downloaded the software and another gentleman, whose name I forgot to ask for, walked me through that part. Both men were very helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. I'm 59 and not at all computer comfortable much less computer savvy and they both made it easy and painless. Thanks so much!Maureen R"
Varun Bhat,3,5,"Blazing fast Photon Technology actually works very fast, it detects the virus the moment it gets stored on my drive. Also the Bitdefender suite is very helpful providing other add-ons such as Anti-Theft, Privacy Cleaner, Vulnerability Check. As a customer I am very satsfied with Bitdefender as I not only have to be assured about my security but I can get those additional features which takes care about the other aspects of my system."
Jimmyz,1,5,"I have been a Bitdefender client for over 6 years and I might add a very satisfied customer.  On My last experience ""an On Line Chat"" with Narcis, I was on the line less than 4 minutes to correct my issue.  Let me tell you if interested, YOU can not go wrong with Bitdefender"
Greg Hollingsworth,1,5,"Decided to change security suites (4 months ago), researched the options and settled on Bitdefender. Impressed with its performance to date and had a couple of very small customer service issues which were resolved expediently and completely."
Darshan Datta,1,2,I've been using Bitdefender for 2 years. It's very good but beware of false positives. Last year I was upgrading my internet dongle software to latest version from official website. During the upgrade process Bitdefender considered the new software malicious and interfered which resulted in my dongle being permanently damaged. :( but my overall experience about security has been positive.
Wayne Ryerson,1,5,"I had some problems with the installation,and their customer service both on the phone and in e-mails was great, they solved the problem and kept following up to make sure  all was well. I have used Bitdefender for years and have been very happy with it. Thanks very much. Wayne Ryerson"
David Hartell,1,2,"I found Bitdefender Total Security Multi-Device 2015 unusable, I bought a three year subscription based on internet reviews and have had a horrible experience with this product. The latest problem is that when installing the product on my desktop, it refused to validate my subscription even though I have over 800 days left. The website fails to perform basic tasks, for instance I try to remove a device from my subscription and it remains even after multiple attempts to remove the device."
Peter Jensen,42,5,Install Bitdefender AV and you won't see a virus again (I did not). Their service is just fine.
Dean Danford,1,5,"Contacted Bitdefender querying how to drop out an old laptop and insert their software onto a new tablet, a second computer. It was pleasing that my experiences of a few years' back were just as positive and they were just as customer-focused. The necessary approach was resolved over a few emails and they coached me through the resolution. Excellent attitude and greatly appreciated; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them and their product."
Sam Rhodes,1,5,"I feel very safe with Bitdefender "" looking over my shoulder"". I, being not very tech savvy, am so glad I found Bitdefender. They make you feel protected with their daily reports of your computer safety. I recently went to a site, by accident, that turned out to be a scam and it really ""shook"" my nerves but, the techs at Bitdefender reassured me that everything was OK. They did a very thorough search and found out that I was safe from this scam. I can not thank Bitdefender enough. If someone contacts you and says your computer is infected and they ask for money to ""fix"" it, get as far away from them as possible. I highly recommend Bitdefender. I'm protected...are you?"
Mrudul Sankhe,1,5,"I upgraded my bitdefender total security from 2015 to 2016. But I was unable to migrate with my old licence key. I tried using the method on their site for bitdefender central, but was unable to migrate. So I contacted support team, through the central bitdefender page. My problem was solved within 24 hours and I was migrated to bitdefender total security 2016 with my old licence key.Thankyou for your support bitdefender )))"
Steve Kemp,2,5,"I've used Bitdefender for about 6 years now. A couple of those at a company I worked for, it always ran flawlessly and in the background. I had a small issue with the latest install but after a time it went through and I'm protected once again. Great product and very reasonably priced."
Mohannad,1,5,I like Bitdefender it's awesome and easy their technologist are professional and fully equipped they are fully respectful and they are accurate and they deserve to be number one world wide hope they be number one always.
Howard,8,5,"I have just purchased and installed Bitdefender Internet Security 2016. The istallation itself was straightforward and, with one exception, trouble free.After the installation my wireless printer wouldn't work if the firewall was enabled, and I wasn't able to solve it via the programme's help facility.I called Customer Support for assistance and was able to get through virtually immediately. I explained my problem to their representative and he guided me through the steps I needed to take to resolve the problem. He patiently waited whilst I re-booted my computer to complete the process and ran a test to confirm the problem was resolved. He was friendly, polite, knowledgeable, articulate and comprehensible.Well deserving of a 5 star rating - I can't think how my experience could be bettered.Thanks Bitdefender!!!Howard"
j wakil,1,4,Great software. Install and basically never worry again.Bit too aggressive with default install.  Google and Mozilla were both coming up as untrusted sites!
Rakesh Kanojia,1,5,I am using Bitdefender since 7 years now & no issues. Run quietly in the background & stable.
Norman Fraser,1,5,I have done about everything wrong a customer could do to maintain a security program on a computer.  Bitdefender has done a magnificent job.
Daniel,1,5,I am of fan of Bitdefender's products for years.I am very happy of it in both MAC and windows.High quality !This is a must...Daniel
Colbert Chisolm,1,5,"Had trouble getting Bitdefender installed on 2nd computer and getting the proper screens to follow.  I would give up after nothing worked.  Every few days I would get an email from support asking me if everthing was o'k.  I finally worked it out with help from support.  The problem was not Bitdefender but my browser Google Chrome. Switched browser and zip, zip everything downloaded clean and it has not skipped a beat.  I'm staying with this Company.  The people at Bitdefender Support are AWESOME."
Jonathan Wood,1,1,First lost software with windows 10 upgrade was not able to recoveror reinstall. As Bitfinders system is not set up well. so purchased 2016 my second mistake. no that Will not activate. Customer service/tech support just said sorry. We are working on issues. Is that all we can help you with. No solution or inquiry in to situation or account . I am not impressed with company at all.
Alexandru Lazeanu,1,5,"I am using Bit-defender for many years and i did not had problems with viruses.Bit-defender was protecting my computer.I do not know how a very malicious malware succeeded to infect my computer(Windows 10?)Everything was wrong in my computer.Practically useless.The only hope was Bit-defender support..They worked 24 hours for repairing the computer.and my computer is working now like new..For that I have to thank very much to Miss(Mrs?)Ioana Bistricianu,to Alex,Robert and Andrew who worked 24 hours to repair the infected computer.I would like to have such people in many support centers which maybe i will need in future.A.L"
Chris Groves,14,5,I had a problem installing Bitdefender - it kept telling me I had Norton installed. We tried everything to get rid of it and after several attempts the Bitdefender staff sent me a file that solved the problem. They went to a lot of trouble to sort this out. Would recommend to anyone.
Hanna Famulare,1,1,"I looked online to find a new antivirus since my old subscription to another program expired. I wanted to find a better and less expensive program to fit my needs. I was told ""Bitdefender"" was the best choice for me..Ha..I bought the product, downloaded it, then went to login in..""Unexpected Error"" It repeatedly told me I wasn't connected to the internet! Repaired, Uninstalled, reinstalled.  Still nothing.Tried to contact support with no luck. Now I'm out $30 bucks. Save your MONEY, and your TIME!"
Cairn Huff,1,5,"I purchased and used Bitdefender for one three-year contract period. I was very pleased with the product during that time. I did not renew however (chose to use a free alternative).  Some time after the end of that period, I discovered that Bitdefender had billed me for a follow-on three year contract, without my awareness or permission.  I raised this with the Bitdefender service organization, and they refunded my credit card promptly.  My dealing with the service organization was easy (via email) and effective.  I'm still not pleased that Bitdefender did the attempted auto-renewal, but I am VERY pleased at the way they handled the matter once I raised it with them."
Jo Bevan,1,5,"Bitdefender Total Security 2016 product: Very happy with the product, easy to use interface. With great added security features. I also like that you can view in detail, the scan results listed including email scan.I am using this software on a Surface Pro tablet, running Windows 10, without any computer lagging.Bitdefender Customer Service: Phone support - Call waiting time short, Very helpful, professional & prompt with support follow through.Senior Tech Engineer -  Prompt response, Professional, provided easy to understand instructions to quickly fix a small problem. Prompt follow up reply after I notify him the steps that he provided had fixed the issue.Facebook Bitdefender Team - Prompt reply, Very helpful, Professional.Thank You Bitdefender.Highly Recommend. 👍"
haydenben,1,5,"I am VERY HAPPY AND SATISFIED with the way the Bitdefender staff responded to problems on my computer after I installed the program. The program had caused such a serious computer slow-down that I had to uninstall it. After I communicated with Bitdefender explaining the situation, they responded giving instructions for running certain searches on my computer. I ran the searches and returned the results to them as they requested. They eventually sent further instructions explaining what I should do to change things on my computer. I followed the instructions and the problems were COMPLETELY resolved. The whole process took over a month, but at the end they actually gave me four EXTRA months of service due to the troubles I had experienced!"
Theodore St Shenouda,1,5,"BitDefender, does not  slow down my computer, nor causes any operational issue whilst protecting the system. despite all of it features, wallet, autopilot, Ransomware and more, the system works flawlessly.I have tried more than 4 types of virus protection software and they have not shown the same quality or efficiency as BitDefender, I recommend BitDefender too all who ask me ""what is the best anti-virus software?"".Their customer service is unequaled, they responded to my issue immediately, offered alternatives and resolved my issues according to my preference. Excellent, I hope they never change their ethics towards customers, ever."
Carol Roob,1,5,"I ordered Bitdefender over the internet and when I went to install it, I must have done something wrong, because it said I had the ""trial"" one.  But I had already paid for it, so I emailed Bitdefender Support, they answered immediately, and my problem was solved."
puvaneswary,1,5,"While Bitdefender is the best antivirus I have used thus far and I have no complaints about the customer service on the international site, customer service in Malaysia is poor. My email enquiry several weeks ago has been unanswered while my follow up call revealed a staff confirming they had received my email and will respond accordingly. It was a simple enquiry asking how I could avail on the renewal discount that was posted on the website."
Motionjunkie,2,4,"I'd give it a 5 star, but I don't think this program is ready for a 5 star yet. I think the potential is there, but it's not exactly user friendly for the non-techie, so no 5 star. I've used McAfee and Trend Micro, and I would say Bitdefender surpasses those programs mainly because it does not lock up your system when scanning, but here are my complaints.1 When an issue is found on my computer, the program captures/quarantines but it doesn't clearly define the problem and even gives you the option of keeping or deleting, which is insane given the fact that most of us are NOT techies. We depend on these programs to do the thinking for us. I don't speak techie, so I have no idea what step to take.2 A lot of the program is NOT clearly explained and is often confusing, (as is the case with move security programs). 3 Even though I have it set for ""AUTO PILOT"" it doesn't always auto scan so I have to initiate . I wish they would just speak to the non-techie so it's not a guessing game.I bought this program based on the reviews and I'll most likely stick with it.I would recommend, but it needs to think about us non-techies."
Joseph,1,5,Every encounter was an easy process without compromise to service and favourable outcomes.Thank you to all staff at Bitdefender.Joseph.
Nicoara Cosmin,1,5,"Once installed you're relief begun. Leave it on autopilot and you can work  or play or whatever you want on your PC / mobile undisturbed. He take care of everything regarding digital security. I must say that indeed Photon technology included, make the presence of your AV virtual nonexistent. Believe me, this is not a advertisement. I'm actually one happy user that pay for theirs software because it worth every cent. To conclude: It is not compulsory to take my word for it, but if you decide to use this software you can for 30 days trial. After that you will be glad of your choice and... you can thank me later :-))."
Sasha,1,3,"The product itself is good however their customer service is atrocious. They have a 30 day money back guarantee that I went to claim the day after I purchased the product via Avangate's (Bitdefender's Customer Service) live chat. The customer representative informed me that I would receive an email within 48 hours to proceed with the refund request. When the 48 hours passed and I still didn't receive the expected email I went to try the live chat again, but it didn't work. It directed me to make a ticket. I updated them on the situation with the reference number for the initial conversation I had on live chat as proof. Two tickets sprung from that and one of them only ever got the automated response that assures you they are working on it and they'll get back to you asap. When the other ticket was finally being responded to by a person she didn't even address the main objective of what the ticket was about (I'm certain she only skim read the ticket); which was to cancel the subscription and to issue me a refund. I immediately emailed back requesting for them to cancel/refund, and repeated that statement four times to make it abundantly clear of what i wanted. When the reply to that email was another automated response i sent them another email that informed them of what i expected, and the actions I would take if those expectations are not met. I told them that I've given them an ample amount of time to resolve the ticket, that if I don't receive my refund by the next day i will call them, if by the end of that call I still don't have my refund, i will file a complaint with PayPal and BBB. The next day I called and eventually got forwarded to a supervisor. The supervisor assured me he'd make my ticket a priority and that someone will handle it. I asked if I could just be forwarded to them, was informed that the department that handles cancellations/refunds don't have a contact number, and can only be reached by email. I asked when should i be expecting a response he told me within 24 hours. I told the supervisor that Ill give them the 24 hours, but if I don't receive my refund by then i will file those complaints through PayPal and BBB. I did get my refund (11 days after the original request) within those 24 hours, thankfully.For a company that has 24/7 customer service their response time is awful. The interactions between me and their customer representatives were less than satisfactory. Their responses were always the bare minimum, and lacked any helpful advice to proceed to the next step. They all seem to have the mentality of ""Lets pass the issue to the next person, and be of no use once so ever other than to tell them that you'll hear from customer support at a later date."". Avangate has a lot to learn before they become an efficient customer service that lends to a more pleasant experience for the customer.I'm convinced that if I didnt tell them my intentions on filing a complaint they would have continued to give me the run around; possibly until the 30 days were passed. That is just speculation though so I cant put it against them, but I wouldn't put it beneath them either."
Ken Ritzert,4,5,The price is pretty good since it covers 3 computers.  It is easy to install and get running.  Some items or features that the program has could be explained a little more in detail for us few who are not all that high tech.  The program runs very well and has prevented my computer from all sorts of infections or infestations.  I feel completely safe with Bitdefender.  It is constantly updating to make sure it is up to date.  Highly recommended.
mpkramer,2,5,"BitDefender is my ""go-to"" product! I have been in the industry for over 20 years and finally found a great solution! There customer support is phenomenal. I was able to utilize email and kept a dialogue going with the same support person through our back and forth emails. Support was extremely responsive and took care of my issue and a couple of other issues as well. I highly recommend BitDefender to anyone looking for a great computer security solution!"
Sharon S,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for over a year now, and my HP laptop, which runs Windows 7professional, has been virus free the entire time. Not only does Bitdefender scan consistently, it also warns me if I am trying to visit a website that may contain malicious software. In addition to great virus protection, the Bitdefender customer service is excellent!  When I called Customer Service I was delighted when my call was answered immediately by a knowledgeable person! My issue was immediately resolved. Bitdefender is truly the best."
John D,1,1,"It seems to be a common thread with Bitdefender, shame I didn't check out the reviews on their customer service before buying the product...Here's my exeperience so far.....I received an email saying that they were going to auto renew my subscription. I don't recall choosing this so I tried to log on to my Bitdefender account to check this but couldn't remember my password.Their password reset option on the website didn't send me an email so I raised a support ticket. Other than an automated reply I heard nothing for 24 hours.I tried their online chat - service unavailable.I followed the support ticket link to check the progress of my ticket but without a password I couldn't...The password reset from the support ticket link allowed me to reset the password (but stupidly, this password doesn't work for my Bitdefender account login..!). This let me in to the support page for my ticket only to get an error message saying ""Sorry, the action you are trying to perform is not allowed"". Briliant. Now I can't even see the progress of my support ticket....So I raised another support ticket about this...And...I receive an automated response.2 days later and I've not received anything from them for EITHER support ticket.I work in IT support for a software company and we would be out of business in a hearbeat if we dealt with customer support issues in this way."
Keith Olsen,1,5,I have been a bit of a computer geek for the past thirty years.  I have purchased most of the popular protection software over those years and have found Bitdefender to be the best protection at the best price.  I would highly recommend Bitdefender to all computer owners.
Huy Pham,1,5,"I tried avg, avast, avira and Bitdefender is the one protecting my computer best. And don't mention kaspersky to me cause I hate this one the most. It's like ""Hey, I'm too good to have a free version or some ****"" Conclude: choose Bitdefender and be happy :)"
Kevin Herhold Larsen,29,5,"I'm protected by you on my android device and 2 computer. I want to thank you for a world class job. No one above, no one beside, simply the best.Ps. I looked at you and kaspersky when i wanted a new security provider. I tried both of you for a 1 month trial. I chose you and i have never looked back. Thanks again."
Sourav Bhor,1,5,"I have been using BIS since 2012 & I am really satisfied with it. No virus infection & most important it is battery friendly. When I installed Kaspersky or Norton on my pc before installing BD they were all resource hogger & battery sucker. But BD was an exception. When I installed it overall system performance improved drastically & battery lasts long triple the previous time. I personally recommend BD to everyone whoever asks me for Antivirus solution. Go for it, Best software ever used. About their customer service, it was fantabulous I would rate five star for their services as well as for their knowledge regarding the problem I was facing. Yes they took more time, but provided me with proper solution which was great. Thank you BitDefender team for creating such a great product for energy saving through Photon technology & Artificial Intelligence met Security 2016 product range."
Cliff Robison,1,1,"I purchased this software because it was a top pick. On install, I ran into a problem (that wouldn't allow install) and neither the company I bought from (Herman Street) or Bitdefender is reachable or has an FAQ that solves the problem. If what you want is to solve your problem quickly and go about your business, I don't think either of these companies is a good choice."
Wachyu Danyanto,2,4,"I have used BitDefender Total Security for many years and wouldn't want to change/use with another AntiVirus/Protection product from another vendor. It was great detecting many virus, worms, trojans, other threats and other vulnerability inside Windows. But two times I renewed the licensed with promotional Free 6 Extra Months and paid with Avangate, BitDefender expiration date always having incorrect expiration date (the 6 extra free month did not shows up in current license). I had to create ticket with BitDefender Support and showing the invoice from Avangate with the option 6 Free Extra Months. Finally problem solved and the expiration date have been changed and it works perfectly now. I am truly happy with the BitDefender Support eventhough I have to raise the support ticket to severity to 1 (highest priority) because of the license expiration date have near it's end date. Overall I am quite happy with the BitDefender Product and it's Support."
Heath,1,5,"I had a problem after the new Windows 10 update. I had attempted to solve the issue myself following some online support, as well as vague advice from a ""Tech"". All of this lead to a huge problem. I contacted Bitdefender, the staff was quick, polite, very specific with directions, and completely solved the issue even though they had not caused it. Extremely happy for the support, since the laptop manufacturer was of little help, even though I was well within the warranty and tech support period. Huge thanks!!"
J. Hunter Lincoln,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for many years and wouldn't want to use anything else. I was very impressed when I had a problem which I had been unable to solve myself. I had the pleasure to connect with ""Norman"". He was very knowledgeable and patient with me when I was having trouble following his commands. He kept telling me not to worry and that he was there to help me. finally problem solved and it works as before. Thanks Norman. I am disappointed that I had to uninstall several programs to get it to work again. Norman said that they don't work with Bitdefender."
Meskerem,1,1,"After running into problems during installation of one of their security software, I decided to use another software and therefore immediately within 10 minutes of making the purchase I asked these guys for a refund. They invalidated my license but are not making the refund although they keep on saying I'm going to get it in 48 hours every time I call their customer care department. It has now been more than two weeks after my request and no refund yet and nor would they say by when I'm going to get the refund. I complained, had that escalated but stil no resolution. PayPal (through which payment is made) is not helping me either.Apparently BitDefender's policy on refunds is that they effect them in 48 hours maximum but they're trying to deny me that for over two weeks and continuing.Horrible company. I've never run into such substandard practices by any company selling their products or services online. They basically are trying to rip me off. Beware of them! There're many competitors out there, usee their products! Don't deal with Bitdefender! Stay away from them!There're several bad experiences I learned from many product review websites about BitDefender practically denying several people of refunds and executing unauthorized license renewal charges.Finally, I will continue to try to get my refund and expose these guys of their worst scamming practices to The Better Business Bureau (BBB) and The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and so on.Finally, I'd like to state that even if they succeed in ripping me off my money, I promise it'd not be without a consequence to their actions. I'll work hard to get these guys get warned, corrected and perhaps disciplined by FTC."
Steve Cripe,1,5,"This application was recommended to me by a well-known tech/IT professional. Easy installation, runs silently in the background, updates itself without problems. Just install it and forget it! I recently had a question for tech support. They answered promptly, had me send them some log information and quickly wrote back with easy to follow instructions. I would recommend anyone install the Free Antivirus Edition, or one of their many other reasonably priced apps that do much more."
Captain,5,5,its more then 5 stars
Sal C,1,5,They Get Right To The Point And Fix It!!
Gary Wirsu,2,4,Very satisfied with product and recommend
Katherine Lawrence,1,3,"I had several issues with Bitdefender's mobile app soon after installing. The first problem was that the Anti-Theft module was too intrusive on my phone. I could not find any way to turn it back off, other than uninstalling, and there was no documentation on the website. I sent my question to tech support, and it took a long while to hear back. They were apologetic, but in the meantime, I'd tried to uninstall (following instructions I did find) and that had problems, too. (Essentially the process didn't work as it should.) Eventually, with tech support help, I was able to verify that anti-theft was turned off. After that, my Clean Master app, which monitors frequently restarting apps (among other things), was reporting that Bitdefender was repeatedly restarting (e.g., 7 times in 5 minutes). Again, tech support solved it, but very slowly."
michael leach,4,5,"Once you get to the online chat room you cannot go wrong, they will sort your problem out for you and not pass you around until you log off in frustration.all the best to your team Michael Leach."
Jon Masterson,15,1,"I heard good things about this product.  I had to buy to download.  The install went wrong leaving me without AV or Firewall protection.  The process of activation failed.  I finally managed to remove it and restore my previous protections.  I asked for a refund and eventually got a response offering me either help to fix or a refund.  I confirmed I wanted a refund.  That was a couple of weeks ago.  They are now ignoring me and I have to dispute the charge via my card issuer.  There are plenty of other good, less intrusive and more helpful AV solutions.  This product may be good - I never got the chance to find out but their  customer service is entirely unsatisfactory.  I would not buy from them ever again.UPDATEPlease note the reply from BitDefender below and I have now received confirmation of the refund.  This is good but it should not have taken so long nor a bad review on TrustPilot or me disputing the charge via my card company."
Wouter,1,1,"Good virusscanner! Has worked very well for me!Unfortunately, they are apparently not to be trusted. They set you up for autorenewal of your purchase, effectively making it a subscription. I was very disappointed to find this and have immediately terminated my connections with bitdefender. If you can't trust them with your credit card, how can you trust them with your entire PC?"
Paul,14,5,"After trying several Big Name anti-virus packages in the past and being disappointed by their performance impact on my PC, I tried Bitdefender a few years ago and found them to be great. In fact they just seem to be getting better.Their Total Security package is superb and doesn't seem to slow my PC. I have also found their customer service department to be polite, responsive and very helpful on several occasions.I would defiantly have no hesitation in recommending Bitdefender as a security solution."
Jacqueline Ali,1,2,"I purchased Bitdefender for my PC about a year ago and it was pretty good at keeping it clean. Shortly afterwards, my PC broke for unrelated reasons and I purchased a Mac. Little did I know that Bitdefender had set themselves up for automatic renewal so they could rip me off for $90 a year later. I found out about the charge when they charged a debit card I no longer use and OVERDREW my account. I called them to tell them that I no longer have a PC and therefore cannot use and do not want their overpriced product and would like a refund (on their website there's even a request refund button if they automatically renewed against your will). However, I have not gotten a refund and instead they just want to sell me their Mac version for half price. DO NOT trust these people or their customer service. I am still fighting to get my money back for a product I can't use (I own no PCs to use it on) and will NOT give them money for their stupid Mac version which I don't need (I already have a different brand on my Mac)Leave while you can, or they will charge you forever."
Nicolette Cuyler,1,5,"I have tried many antivirus programmes over the many years I have been in business. When I came across Bitdefender by sheer chance I thought, okay another one full of promises and no delivery. Tried it and ""lo and behold"" that was about 8 years ago and I am still with them. Never had a days problems, service is good and responses informative. My computer runs smoothly and I can be at peace knowing my work is safe. Carry on the good work guys."
Martha Cuthill,1,1,"I was renewing my subscription.  It started out the the activation key they sent me via email didn't work.  After submitting a help request they sent an email asking me to submit a help request which I did and got an email to submit a help request.  However, the problem resolved itself overnight.  I didn't receive any email notification that the problem was solved, I just discovered that it was all working.  Then tried to install on 2nd computer.  They sent an email with an APP to download, which would not connect.  Timed Out.  Sent another help request and got an email asking me to submit another help request.  Going nowhere fast.  Not resolved yet.  So far no real person has attempted to contact me regarding this.  Very unhappy.  My old subscription runs out tomorrow.  Want my money back or the problem fixed.  Now!!!"
Alan Chuang,1,5,Thre best and easy way to protect your pc .
Alistair,6,5,On line assistance was excellent with helping me with my security software renewal problem. The support team were Fantastic and extremely polite.  The live chat  experience was very positive and my pc was sorted after following their guidelines.
Dimitri Michailidis,1,5,Reliable customer care
Peter Kinloch,1,5,Bitdefender took the trouble to fix my small problem. Big companies are either bullies or friends to little customers. Little customers spread the word.Bitdefender was a big help. Spread the word.
John Bourke,1,5,First thing.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  For the first time I the peace of mind knowing that my system is truly protected.I recently needed confirmation about overlapping subscriptions. I had upgraded to 2016 Total security but I still had some time still running on my 2015 subscription.  The accounts were married and the time remaining extended.  Very professional staff and wonderful communication.  I am very happy with the whole experience.with thanks.John Bourke
Jonathan,1,5,"Bitdefender was suggested to me by others for computer security. I can definitely say it was worth it because features are on-point and easy to understand. They made sure everyone can easily clean up and optimize their pc's and laptops at a click of a button. Also, support answers back quickly and with easy to follow instructions for any type of concern. I'm very satisfied with their service!"
Rick,1,4,"I have used Bitdefender for a number of years now and it has improved over time. Customer service is excellent when I need to contact them and when they see a problem not only do they help me, many times they give me an extra few months for free."
Michael N. Petersen,68,5,That's how I feel with Bitdefender Internet Security. I trust it.
Nick,8,5,"Bitdefender Free is the easiest antivirus I've ever used. It's simple, compact and does not slow down my system like other antivirus software I have used. I know a lot of users still on Windows XP and Bitdefender Free is their only choice for security. Bitdefender customer support also gets a 5-star rating. Great job all the way around."
The Red Baron,5,5,"The installation of Bitdefender IS 2015 was tricky as traces of other 3rd party AV packages prevented full installation. The install program first of all downloaded a large file(s) and then told me that I had to uninstall a previous AV installation. When this was done, the setup program had to be manually restarted and again, the large file(s) were downloaded. My broadband connection is capped so I just ask, why must the file(s) be downloaded again each time ? In my case 3 times before Bitdefender installed. However, registration now proved to be a problem.Eventually I emailed Customer Support who provided me with links to download several clean-up utilities for the AV systems which had previously been installed and supposedly uninstalled but which had left traces behind which needed deleting. A frustrating but necessary procedure.After these were cleaned out, Bitdefender IS 2015 installed and registered fine.So kudus to Customer Support.The GUI is quite basic but does the job and I'm hardly aware that Bitdefender is working and I'm not aware of any system slowdown even when editing video etc."
LE GARS Yves,2,5,"I have a honed ""expérience"" with Awake Bitdefender 2011.I have just done this closed this application and i would like ti use it again.I wish you a good day.Cordialement. Yves."
Ali Sabouri,3,5,"I have been a satisfied user of Bitdefender for many years. It's just getting better and better. It could do with making protection even better against some nasty viruses that block you from starting your computer and ask for money to remove it. Also, strengthen the automatic updating - as, sometimes the red Bitdefender logo turns grey and you are asked to update manually. in my experience, Bitdefender is definitely the best computer security software in the market and its customer service/helpdeskis excellent."
Alan Lang,3,5,I have Been using bitdender for nearly 3 years now. Had a couple of problems with upgrading the software and when I upgraded my os to windows 10. Both times the support center was helpful and quickly resolved  the issues. I have recommended bitdender to a couple of friends and wouldn't hasetate in the future.
Karl,1,1,"Purchased Bitdefender Total Security Multi - Device on 30th September. Im sure the sofware is good but i did not like the way the firewall had to be configured, so i requested a refund via a support ticket on 5th October. I waited 48 hours and received no reply so i asked for an update on 7th October. After receiving no reply from them by the morning of the 8th I emailed again mentioning I would open a PayPal dispute if no response was received by 1400 that afternoon. I received a generic email a few hours later saying they are looking into it.On the 9th October having received no further emails I opened a dispute with Paypal and Bitdefender sent an email to say the order was cancelled, but still no word on the refund. Today i received an email at 1206 saying i need to close the dispute otherwise they cant refund me. I thought some progress was being made so closed the dispute and informed them of this. So far no further information has been received from them.Overall I am very dissapointed with the customer support, a refund for a digital product should not be this difficult to process. Unless you think you will never need to contact their support, I would avoid using Bitdefender products."
Paul Mcmahon,3,4,Had a few issues moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10 but all was sorted with a few emails back and forth  .
John Holm Olsen,12,1,"When I installed Bitdefender it uninstalled an essential bit of software for ASUS motherboards: ""AI Suite"" which controls the fans. - I asked for a refund because I cant live with a computer which sounds like a Jet. Most other antivirus software dont have a problem with the AI Suite, but Bitdefender does! - So if You have an ASUS motherboard; dont buy Bitdefender!"
Philippe Hung,1,5,Once that was done Bitdefender Internet Security wasn't responding and shortcuts were all gone. Chatted with support team member Vladimir who gave me all the info I needed to bring Bitdefender back to life.Thanks again Vlad.Happy Bitdefender user.
Dan,1,5,"Have used Bitdefender Total Security for a few months and can tell that is light on resources, offers very good protection according to AV-Test, has a very good optimiser included and the customer support team is top notch."
Michael Gough,1,4,"I bought Total Security 2015 for 3 devices in 2014 after using Internet Security for a couple of years before that. Both have given good protection and I have never had a serious problem with malaware. However, after a renewal earlier this year, I noticed that the information on the My Bitdefender site had become out of date (last update and scan information) and out of kilter with the correct information in the  applications on each device. I was guided by customer support and the eventual solution was to migrate to the 2016 version which uses a different on-line site - Bitdefender Central. Migrating the first device went smoothly. Migrating the second gave me twice the number of days left and migrating the third resulted in 3 times the number of days left. I did the honest thing and owned up to this and a bug was discovered, which has now been corrected. This was a long and convoluted process and I must commend Valentin Stegaru of Customer Services, who guided me with knowledge and infinite patience. A good outcome, with Bitdefender Central and all three devices now being in sync with one another, but I would have liked the system to be more bug free from the outset."
Brian Wood,4,5,"I recently upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 only to find that my Bitdefender 2015 Internet Security was not compatible, Once I contacted Bitdefender they guided me ( I am not very computer savy) through the process to solve the problem in minutes. A great service."
Bruce Macdonald,2,4,I had been using the free version of Bitdefender for some nine months without any problem. When I received an email offering the full version at a bargain price I accepted. My problem began when the free version was removed and the installation of the upgrade did not appear to be occurring. When I eventually did successfully download (don't ask me how now) I was advised this was a 30 day trial. I then tried to use you're online chat service several times without success as no-one was available apparently. It took me some time and a bit of Googling to locate an Australian telephone number for advise. The person I eventually spoke to was extremely helpful and solved my issues quite easily. Whilst most of this was probably down to my lack of being an IT expert I feel that the process could have been explained in more detail at the beginning.
Debbie Velky,2,5,"I don't have to ever worry about getting a computer virus when I am protected by Bitdefender. They have all the latest technology to stop any attack before it can do any damage to your computer. What I love the best is Bitdefender Wallet. I don't have to remember or look up my passwords or my information when filling out forms online, it fills in your information automatically, just double click on each box it it doesn't show up. I give Bitdefender 5 stars!!!"
Rob van Hofwegen,17,4,"For many years I´m using Bitdefender. After all these years I am satisfied with the performance of the product . By contrast, I want to mention that it is often an agony to get in touch with Bitdefender support. Just to send an simple email from the support screen is a hopeless task. From the button , Send a mail ' you get into a loop from which you never get in a mail environment . As a user, this is very annoying. If it succeeds to make contact, the reaction time is quite long. Positive is that I am helped well with the problems i had. The product is fine, easy to use, nothing to worry about , but ... in case of problems you need to be a fairly advanced user to contact the support department. If this improves Bitdefender gets five stars from me."
Nicky Gallardo Bijl,4,5,I've been looking for the best security solution for many years. Having tested every major brand out there over the past 10 years I've come to the conclusion Bitdefender is the very best one can choose.
Larry Ohlinger,1,5,"I have been a user of Bitdefender Internet Security for a number of years. I have tried other anti-virus programs, but have stayed with Bitdefender because of the programs ability to detect, and remove virus/ma;ware and protect my computer on the internet.  The program has done an outstanding job and I trust it explicitly and highly recommend it to others."
Dr V V Gaitonde,1,5,"Although the programme is very good, I am not satisfied on the Guide to use the programme.  I am still confused on how to use safepay and how it is linked with wallet.  When login credentials failed to get entered on some websites, I turned to Guide to find out the reason, but I found none.  Further, in some websites the login is in two pages and do not know if wallet is useful in such settings.  All information on how to enter data on websites is provided, but remedies on failure of operation of data is not available. I believe a better Guide to use the programme with a basic demo plus a trouble-shoot for each function is necessary.  Do correct me if I am wrong."
Ranjan Mb,1,5,"i did a lot of homework before getting my bitdefender antivirus plus 2015....atlast i was looking at 2 options ..kaspersky n bitdefender....trust me guys ,the decision i took on that day was the best decision of my life :D ... i love it interface...the power it packs...the silent kills...n everything abut it... n this is going to be my antivirus for rest of my life... good job guys... keep it up!! :)"
Stefan Hebsgaard,18,1,"After buying a one year subscription for I was directed to a page titled download and install. There was only one button on that page and pressing that my account was deducted a further $29.99 for a ""support incident"" without any confirmation and no possibility to cancel.That is simple fraud."
Tish Gia,1,3,"I was a custom of Norton for the past 20 years so got very used to their way of doing things.  Bitdefender was recommended to me and so I went with it.  Wait times on the phone are daunting, something I was not used to with Norton, and paying extra to have someone take over my computer was something about which I was unaware.  That said, the two times I called, the technicians were able to solve my problem.  If the problems are solved as quickly as they were the past two times, then I won't mind that someone won't take over my computer to solve the problem.  But I DO mind the wait time on the phone.  Bitdefender should consider a system where you don't lose your place in line but somebody calls you back as soon as a technician is available.  Lots of places do that now, so the technology is definitely there.  Above all, find a way to cut down on wait time, i.e., hire more technicians if necessary."
Dave,1,1,"I upgraded to windows 10, which necessitated a reinstall of bitdefender.  I got to the point I needed to enter an activation code and entered my license key and it said it was not valid.  I waited 45 minutes to get to a tech on the phone and after we just started to get somewhere, the connection was terminated on his end.  I tried a chat but no one was there.  I finally figured it out on my own based on what the tech said before he was cut off.  They completely changed to a new online registration system (thanks for all the notice on that by the way!) and you have to convert to that.  Now, trying to install on a second PC, if I try to log on to their new system, it automatically kicks you back to the login screen and won't let you log on anymore.  Really?  I'm ready to just put an ice axe through the machine and be done with it.  No realistic way to contact them, no way to get a resolution, and wholesale changes to their system with no notice."
Deby Watts,1,5,"This is the second year iI have puchased Bitfender, because I trust them 100 percent."
Mike in NC,1,5,"Having recently had the need for a 'fresh install' of our desktop computer's OS, I contacted BitDefender for a ""how to"" on how to reinstall our Internet Security 2015 software. We had about six months remaining on our product license and did not want to lose that time. This was the second time in the past 3-4 years I have had a technical question for the BitDefender team (not product issues, rather, technical glitches on my end), and once again I am so pleased with not only their product support, but the simplified, step by step instructions that never leave you wondering what to do next. I have, and continue to, heartily recommend the award winning BitDefender products to folks I know for their Internet privacy, protection and computer security needs."
Xinthia Albert,1,5,i have  tried all other AV but BITDEFENDER is the BEST! and support service is excellent. i would give 10 stars if it was possible not only 5!They deserve to be no.1 in the world.
mariner1,1,4,"I bought Bitdefender TOTAL SECURITY 2015 3 PCs 1 Year boxed CD Version. This installed  on my PC as only a 30 day trial version. I contacted Bitdefender on the issue and they said they would look into it.They then emailed me for further details [which I had initially already provided].  However, before I had chance to resubmit those details I noticed that my installed version of Bitdefender had suddenly `miraculously even` changed to the full 12 mth version.  I immediately informed Bitdefender of this asking whether this correction was due to something they had done at their end.  They replied that they were pleased the issue had been resolved, but they did not actually answer the question.       So........Whilst I am pleased to now have the correct installation, I am puzzled as to how it came about.  Why oh why do these organisations so often leave people `in the dark` ???"
Aravinda Babu R,1,5,"I love Bitdefender a lot and feel secured with it.I have referred Bitdefender to my family, colleges and my friends.My humble request to Bitdefender is,please provide call blocker facility for Android phones. I have installed Bitdefender security for his laptop, after installing it, laptop becomes very, very slow.I don't understand why it has happened? Please guide me which Bitdefender product I use for laptop,and desktop so that it shouldn't become too slow."
GranoblasticMan,1,5,"Contacted their customer service because I accidentally bought a ""new"" plan instead of renewing one I already had. They were able to merge the two plans no problem =)"
PJG,1,5,"I've had BD for 3 years and they have provided outstanding support for all my issues. They have provided solutions, not just timely responses.Their software is always on the leading edge. Looking forward to the 2016 version.Thank You.."
Brandon Rubio,1,4,"I haven't had this software for very long at all but so far I've had no issues what so ever! The one time I had close to an issue, it was resolved in a matter of minutes! Great service, awesome program"
ilpapacha,1,5,"Reliable and has a very low impact on performance! I also have to add that has a remarkable after sales support, as I had an issue with my account and was solved in a very short period of time. I would definitely suggest it to everyone!"
Waczoe007,1,5,Bitdefender is great!I've been dealing with their teams since the past 3 years it is an awsome easy to use product at an excellent affordable price!Recommended Bitdefender to many of my friends and they to are very satisfied!Thanks Pascal
Philip M. Levine,1,5,"My timing was perfect. Two days before signing up for Bitdefender's Identity Theft Protection I get an email from them letting me know of an event. This was my experience with ID theft. They were able to tell me the source was that someone used my name and ID to sign up for a credit card. The gave me the name of the bank where it was done. It's important to remember that the client (me) is responsible for taking action not Bitdefender. I got on the phone with a Bitdefender rep almost immediately. She explained to me how these things work - I had no idea. Now I'm a pro. I went to my police department and filed a police report, got on the phone with ID Watchdog who works with Bitdefender and started piecing together the way it all works. As a result I ordered credit freezes on the three credit reporting agencies ad took other steps to deal with this. As I mentioned this theft occurred 2-3 days just after I signed up for the ID Protection plan. I got lucky!"
Raviraj,3,5,I've been using Bitdefender for more than 3 years and very much satisfied with the performance as it uses less system resources and is very reliable and stable.
Pam Crane,3,4,"I have blessed Bitdefender every day for its vigilance over our family security. But there is a 'but'! ...I and many others have been having problems for months with image uploads to our Weebly websites. It turns out that they are being blocked by Bitdefender. The problem is unresolved, and extremely annoying, as the only way we can get our images to load on the page is to go into Settings, disable anti-malware, and put ourselves at risk.I have begged Weebly to sort this out with Bitdefender, and I sincerely hope they will find a solution as quickly as possible, as we are running out of patience. There is a Weebly Facebook page where the issue is discussed: Apparently Weebly 'took a ticket out' with Bitdefender early this year (2015)... yet here it is autumn and we are still having to endure this frustration and its concomitant security risk. This is, however, the only area where I have encountered a problem with this first-class software."
Scott McGuigan,1,2,"The software works well enough for the cost. It's not the best I've ever seen, and not the worst. But once a year, dealing with this company is absolutely a nightmare. You can't turn off auto-renewal on the website, even though it says you can. It just crashes every time you try. You have to pay $60 up front, and then the next day you'll get an e-mail that says that the software you just bought costs $25 on sale. But when you call to get them to credit you what you paid, they can't do it. Then some schmuck sends you an e-mail a couple of days later offering to just extend your subscription because it's ""difficult"" to process refunds. When you get the runaround, and tell your mom to call and stop her auto renewal before it takes place, the customer service people are completely sexist and won't help a woman."
Ian Lipke,2,5,"I expected that Bitdefender technicians would be able to fix my problem. That's what their training allows them to do. But technicians are not always trained to interact with customers in a cheerful and professional way. It took a long time to solve my problem. I thought Bitdefender technicians had given up. Not on your life. Weeks down the track they came back and asked me to do a Print Screen. That could have been a joke as I have never been able to do that. The technician allowed for that and taught me. Then he came back, told me my problem was no more, explained how he knew that, and wished me well.When I was a kid, there was a saying that meant a certain person or group could not do any better, because they were already the best there is. We used to say, ""They are the ants' pants and the cats' pyjamas"". Well done.Ian Lipke"
Merri Jones,2,5,I've used Bitdefender for the last 3 years. It's worked extremely well for meThe couple of small issues I've had were taken care of in a prompt manner. By taking advantage of their special price offers I've had peace of mind about my computers (3) security at a very reasonable cost. Plus it doesn't hog memory like so many other security systems.
Tim Surgison,1,5,I recommend using bitdefender as it is the least intrusive and least noticeable affect on the running speed of the  machine.
Ruth Sullivan,1,4,Have had Bitdefender on my machines for years and I have to say that having just recovered from a nightmare installation of Windows10 it is impressive that Bitdefender will go to any lengths to ensure that your product is working as it should with new installations like this.  It sometimes is difficult to find a consultant who speaks English but once you have the contact the service is superb.  Would wholly recommend Bitdefender to home and business users.
David,2,5,"I recently had some issues with upgrading and changing the license key over to support the latest version of Total Security 2015, as well as installing it on a second computer. Apart from a delay of 2 days in replying initially, the help given resolved the issues, and I was treated very respectfully and in a friendly manner. Thank you!"
Steve Westlund,3,4,"Excellent product, support is second to none and very reasonably priced.I have had two seperate issues that in fact weren't Bitdefender problems, the support staff were very helpful and assisted methodically, professionally and without getting too techie geek.Very impressed and I will renew when my licence expires"
Chantal Van Der Merwe,1,5,I've been using bitdefender for 3 years now and I would still recommend it to anyone. The support staff are fast and efficient. The program itself informs me immediately if there is an external threat or when I'm accessing a dangerous site. The part I love the most though is that I don't know the program is there. Absolutely love it!
Pierre Zambelli,10,5,I got complete satisfaction de way Bitdefender support center handled my problem I can only recommend this service
Espedal,2,5,Fast response from the support team. Step by step email to fix my firewall settings.
Sir RR,1,5,"I'm a returning BitDefender user. My first usage was around 2006-2009. I had an issue with BitDefender that left a rather bad taste - not due to the software functioning, but due to a lack of customer support in resolving the issue - I switched over to another vendor. Recently, due to AV-Comparatives review of BitDefender's exemplary performance, I decided to give BitDefender another try. I'm so happy that I did. BitDefender customer support is spot on. I accessed customer support via the user interface option and emailed them my issue. I received a timely response - and - they hung in with me as I worked my way through their recommendations. They stayed with the issue all the way to resolution! I'm happy! Not only an effective safeguard for internet exposure, but BD has obviously worked hard to build an equally effective customer support/technical support team. Thank you!"
Jean-Jacques HOCHART,1,4,I sent two messages as there was no answer to my first message after a couple of days.I finally got two answers with explanations. The second was useless of course as the first one had been really effective.
Christine Brewer,4,5,"I reviewed Bitdefender before I purchased it, so I knew it had a high rating, and so far I am satisfied with it."
Alan Ratcliffe,3,5,"In the years I have used Bitdefender, I have found their products do an excellent job. I recently had a problem we my Total Security after I had up graded to Windows 10 but the problem was Identified and a solution provided in a way that was easy for someone with my limited computer knowledge to apply successfully. Very impressed."
George DiPietro,1,5,"I have had Bitdefender installed on my system for over two years and I am very confident that my system is very safe. I am very comfortable with the level of protection.  During that time, I have had very minimal problems or complications and Bitdefender responded and resolved my issues/concerns in a very timely manner.  I would recommend Bitdefender to anyone looking for computer security."
The Hawk,1,4,When I could not get other software to rid my PC of a Trojan Bitdefender did.  When upgrading to Win 10 the customer service tech made the process easy!  Thanks Bitdefender...
Cynthia Brill,3,5,When I update To Windows 10 it cut out my Bitdefender.  When I contacted them we had to try a few things to correct the problem.  I was so impressed by the way they did not give up on me.
Don McPhail,4,5,"Have used Bit Defender for a number of years (ever since it was top-rated by Consumer Reports).  Never, I repeat, never have had a bit of trouble from any outside virus etc.  Anytime I have called Bit Defender, the representative I've talked  to has quickly answered my questions.I just can't recommend them enough."
Jon,1,5,"I had left it late to renew and when I did I could not get the connection, after payment, to activate the renewal. I communicated this to Bitdefender  and in about 2 days the renewal was activated and I was covered again but I had not had a reply to my earlier communication (panic). You resolved the problem but I was not aware of the progress.Thanks anyway.I have been using B/d for a few years now and it has informed me of risks when I have been on line and made me reject some suspect communications. I am reassured by this."
kenneth  Barry,12,5,"I have found Bitdefender to be reliable. It advises me if anything is untoward,immediately.  If I have a query, it is answered by one of their team and has always solved my problems.   I recommend Bitdefender Total Security.                        Ken."
Paul,1,5,"I still had 80 days on my subscription when I decided to purchase another year at a really good price. The installation deleted my old version and replaced it with the new one. Great! Except that I lost the 80 days. I sent a quick email and they promptly explained what caused the issue and that they'd happily add the lost time to my new product key. They gave me a time frame for when I could expect the remedy to occur. Bam, no fuss no muss. I expected either a headache from this process or no resolution at all. I'm surprised and glad that I was wrong. Good job, Bitdefender."
Martin Liberazzi,1,5,I had to reinstall Bitdefender after upgrading to Windows 10. No problem with the help of Bitdefender. Thanks.
Allan,1,5,"Bitdefender works very well, have used since 2013, if a problem does happen their team will help you throw it."
Jason Justus Betts,1,5,"This is rated from a gamer and semi proficient PC user. I found bitdefender to be extremely user friendly. It has kept my PC clean for over 2 years now with enough customization options that i felt it was doing what i wanted, not the other way around. Ive tried a lot of different AV options and they are either not catching enough and i end up with glitches and viruses anyway, or they are so over bearing and system heavy that they do what they want and i cant seem to customize them to do what i want. This product was a great mix of protection and flexibility."
Victor,1,5,Great product. Easy to use. The multipack really covers all my mobile devices including mac! Great and prompt customer service. Very useful product. Does not slow down my pc. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
Vicki Bailey,1,5,I have used Bitdefender for a couple of years now it works for me flawlessly. I couldn't be happier. I have now upgraded to Bitdefender Total Security 2015 and have a license for three PCs great value great products. I had a little issue with the install and the product key not working but customer support solved my issues  without a hitch. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone.
Afif Sarker,1,5,I am fully satisfied .
Jackson M1,2,5,"I came from McAfee, a few years back, as it was included in my Windows Vista. After two expensive virus removals, I switched to Bitdefender Total Security and never looked back. I promote Bitdefender every chance I get. Although I understand that Kaspersky is no slouch, it is located in Russia. Which is a huge turn-off for me."
Aleksandr Dubrovin,1,5,"As the title says. I have Bitdefender already more than a year and my pc speed didnt reduce in that whole time, nor did i get any virus that couldnt be treated. And theres no words for how Bitdefender works. You dont even feel how it works in background. Not eating tons of rams when just working on scanning your system for viruses.And customer support is fast and helpful. I am definetely staying with Bitdefender"
Leslie Moore,2,5,I was impressed by the customer service extended to me.  The solution given to correct a problem in relation to aftermath of Windows 10 installation was excellent.
Chris Saemisch,1,5,"I will say that BitDefender support has been excellent. I received an immediate verification that my email was received. I then received a timely answer, both times I used support. They assign  a ticket number to your support issue and that ticket stays open until the issue is resolved. Then they send follow-up emails asking if the issue was fixed, leaving the ticket open until you notify them that the problem has been resolved. Assigning a number to my problem and staying with it until it is fixed, now that's what I call support!"
Malcolm lane,4,5,"I have used Bitdefender  for 1 year and just replaced and i have to say it is better than ever, very easy to set up and works superbly, very impressed and satisfied. The only issue was trying to download the new licence from the link on the e-mail n- it didn't work.Thanks to you all"
Richard Jolin,2,5,"The Antivirus that usually comes with new computers is non effective and their customer service was terrible. Tried another top brand, but found it too interfering when doing work or gaming. Bitdefender was smooth and easy to use, didn't affect other used programs while using them. I love the feature ""Wallet"" that when I use my banking site it protects against any ""keystroke"" software that may be hiding on your computer. Only had two viruses sneak in and that's only after windows 10 came out, contacted customer support and problems were resolved. Never had an issue prior using windows 10. It was a top rated program before I bought it and have only agreed since that it is."
Tony Ugwuegbulam,2,5,"I am impressed with Bitdefender products especially on the safety aspect. Bitdefender warns its users when they are about surfing dangerous environment on the net with it`s funny ""TAKE ME BACK TO SAFETY"" alert and handles threats in a very clear and concise manner. The Safe pay is also another enjoyable feauture.I have been buying and distributing Bitdefender products since 2010 and wish it would be possible to be a recognized distributor of this product. My Clients are happy with the product. Install Bitdefender and use your device peacefully.In my IT work, I have tried and used  various antivirus products but I unbiasedly and sincerely  rate and rank  Bitdefender as number ONE.Now that the world is talking of Windows 10, Bitdefender has not left the hole unplugged. It has before others already filled in the gap with a relevant and suitable Windows 10 antivirus product.BITDEFENDER, Keep the flag flying.Tony"
Bandr,1,5,It's the best security software I ever used
Allan Christensen,92,5,"Easy to use, and one of the best in test anti virus program."
Tedd Springer,1,5,"After upgrading to windows 10, i had a little trouble with getting bitdefender to work properly on my gaming rig and laptops ( all windows 10 upgrades) i contacted customer supported and in a matter of a few days they sent me a link with the detailed instructions on how to fix it. I followed the instructions and i am running flawlessly. I did have to uninstall asus suite to reinstall bitdefender, but i was able to reinstall the suite software with no problems."
Robert Sterbenz,1,5,Problems with pop-ups and false Virus detection from bad malware and adware.  BitDefender responded quickly and requested complete BD scan and log file returned.  Response of their analysis received quickly.  Infections were not of the type that BidDefender protected against.They sent me valuable links to web sites that offered free fix software for the problems that I had.  Thanks to technical staff.  Fixes worked!
Maryetta Ables,3,5,I have come to almost take the Bitfinder for granted as it works so smoothly behind the scene. I look forward to Bitfinder also protecting my Blackberry.
Dion,1,5,Since using Bitdefender I not seen ad pop-ups which would show up when using other antivirus software.I'm very assured that I'm getting good security services by using Bitdefender on my PC.
georgeta gilda petre,1,5,I have had some sad experience with a company which I could not communicate at all.  I felt scared and lost like a wandering sheep.With you I felt encouraged in spite of my poor IT knowledge.Thank you very much!I wish you great success!G G Petre
David White,2,5,"I don't usually pay for antivirus but after several phishing attempts and dodgy emails that seemed to be coming my way I decided to bite the bullet and pay in the hope I would receive a better quality product. I am very happy I did, unfortunately I did have reason to contact Bitdefender pretty much straight away after purchase which did not bode well with me however their advisors were knowledgable and timely in their response and solved my issue quickly. 10/10 bit defender."
Ken Spong,2,5,"Open-minded support who respond in a timely, clear manner.Bitdefender Total Security has been protecting my computers for several years and has not let me down.Malware is always a challenge and sometimes I will run a secondary malware cleaner to make sure the system is clear. Running the second check program, all I get is a short list of PUP's - not bad, Bitdefender. No malware!"
Retana Johnson,1,5,My bitdefender was knocked out when I downloaded windows 10. The service I received from customer support was fast and easy to understand. I am a senior citizen and they were patient and delivered easy to understand steps. Great service.
Robert Bennett,2,5,In all the years I have been using Bitdefender my problems have been kept well in control.  It seems Bitdefender always has the answers.My last problem was with installation of Windows 10.  I E Mailed the question and the answer that worked exactly was sent immediately back to me.How great is that!
Murray Seymour,1,4,"I have found Bitdefender technical help to be excellent each time I've used it over the years, however the time it takes to get a response, sometimes days, is way too long"
Jon,1,5,A paranoid program when threats are around but not memory intensive to the computer. the program seems to learn for itself and once set so can be left alone to get on with the job you bought it for Demolishing sneeky Viruses and Hackers that try to spoil your hard earned computer work.Thanks Team
Vikram,1,5,After spending over an hour troubleshooting an issue cause by a Windows update the Bitdefender rep fixed it in one sentence. Every time I contact them they always come through even when it turns out the issue is NOT related to their product they still guide you to the fix. Great people.
AH,1,5,"This is the second year I've had Bitdefender on my laptop and been completely satisfied with it.  Upgrading to Windows 10 crashed the Bitdefender on my laptop.  Since Windows 10 came with no instructions or support, I contacted Bitdefender, who wrote a patch and very simple directions for how to resolve the problem (in Windows), which worked immediately and easily.  YAY to Bitdefender!"
Ronald B Money,1,5,"I have been in contact with the BitDefender team for a while now and for someone with little savvy with computers, they showed an unbelievable amount of patience with me. No matter what idiotic statements I would make about my problem, they would come right back with another link to click on to help resolve my problem. So, the product is highly recommended, but more than the product is the team that you deal with if you ever run into a problem. I have been using their product for many years and I just won't have anything else on my rig. It's BitDefender or nothing, PERIOD"
Mario,1,5,I had ran into an issue while reinstalling my Bitdefender software after the Windows 10 update. I emailed Bitdefender support and I received a reply within minutes and they walked me through the troubleshooting process and now everything is working perfectly. The support team was very helpful and they followed up with me afterwards to ensure that my issue was fully resolved.
Ardita,1,5,"I honest love my Bitdefender product: Total Security 2015. I love the use of web protection because you can never be too cautious over these things. Also the unlimited devices of PCs, Macs, Androids is a bonus. The optimiser is a nice clean up. Whenever I have a problem with my product I simply go to the support site and get a agent or send a email or look up at the FAQs. A couple of examples: The Windows 10 update came and my product was also compatible with Windows 10. I basically got a update notification from Bitdefender and updated. Simple and easy. Another time I once had a problem with my internet connection, I sent a email to Bitdefender and they replied back and gave me the easy detailed instructions of how to fix it. I followed the steps and all done. Also once it turns out I had a few infective files and Bitdefender resolved it all easy. And a site I visited had malware and it was it good and done by my product. Lastly, the Bitdefender weekly report is a good way to check up and it also gets you notifications of events from update, firewall, anti-virus, theft protection, file encryption etc. Overall, to sum up in brief a amazing product to use and have to be safe and secure."
Zeljko Pintarich,2,5,"I have been running Bitdefender for the last two and half years and in all this time I had problems twice caused by my own negligence, however each time I asked for help, Bitdefender responded in less than an hour (and I live in Australia) and solved my problem almost instantly therefore I can unreservedly recommend this company to any  computer user."
Costel,2,5,This is the best AV on the market. I can't complain about them and customer service? Simply great
Jeff Drury,1,5,"Bitdefender has been very reliable over the years, however this was a rare occurrence which happened with the newly released Windows 10. The firewall was blocking my internet connection and through troubleshooting I was able to determine that Internet connection sharing was the responsible component. I contacted Bitdefender Support who unfortunately did not have a solution at the time but kudos to them for not just letting it go, they worked on it and found a solution and contacted me with the solution. It's nice to see a company who really cares about their customers. Nice job guys!"
David,3,5,Very simple to use support service and a speedy response to my problem with very detailed measures to fix the issue which worked first time. No hard to follow technical jargon just straightforward instructions which is all that is needed. Excellent support service
Robert Haddad,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for many years and I am quite satisfied by its performance as well as by its customer service. I recommend Bitdefender to any user seeking the best protection with a personalized & efficient Customer Care service.Robert Haddad
Apotres,2,5,I have trusted Bitdefender since a few years.It's my first choice when installing computers.
Michele,1,5,"I've had this software for a few years now and can say they are as close to perfect you can get.  They are extremely responsive.  It seems like their responses are almost immediate.  They resolved any issue I had with detailed instructions or without any input from me.  Their customer service and technical service department are second to none.  Polite, diligent, rapid response are how I would describe this the company and it's service.  I have total confidence that Bit Defender will keep my computer safe.  I highly recommend this software, especially to people that are not very competent.  Bit Defender does not interfere with other software on my computer, nor does it slow it down. Bit Defender is the gold standard and second to none."
Khalid Al-obaid,3,5,What I like most about Bitdefender:Real Life protection.Light and fast does not slow down your PC.Ease of use and the GUI interface.Fast customer support.
Richard Fordham-Edwards,1,5,"During Win10 update, Bitdefender Total Security 2015 was removed from the desktop and archived in folder ""Windows.old"".  To restore BTS15 I needed the license key to be re-issued.  Bitdefender Support were prompt  and obliging in their response.  Problem solved."
Dave Malyon,1,5,"I lost my licence key number for a paid for antivirus (total security 2015), so when I needed to have the installation link after a hard drive wipe,  I couldnt very frustratingunusually difficult just to send this email off.why do I need to involve facebook?"
Don Pullinger,1,5,Other than several  unsolicited/unused features supplied as a free addition  - the basic package I've paid for is excellent. Their attentiveness to my problems (mostly caused my ignorance) impressed me more than any other software I've purchased since the early days of Microsoft. (I have had a commercial printing and pre-press company up to my retirement several years ago)
Szilvia Mogyorósy,1,5,I use the Bitdefender Internet Security 2015 on all my devices (3 current time) and I'm very pleased by its look and user friendly interface. Also it's quite unique and sensitive up to date software which would not interfere with your work but have your back 24/7.
BARRY MILLER,3,5,"WHEN I HAD PROBLEMS DOWNLOADING TOTAL SECURITY 2015 TOMY 3rd LAPTOP,  THE BITDEFENDER TEAM REPLIED TO MY EMAILIMMEDIATELY WITH A LINK, WHICH SOLVED THE PROBLEM FOR ME.BEING NOT SO TECH. SAVVY, ITS GOOD TO KNOW THAT THESEPROFESSIONALS ARE ON HAND TO GIVE ASSISTANCE."
Richard,3,5,"No unsolvable problems. User friendly, works in the background and tells me it has stopped infections."
Marie Friscia,1,5,I have had viruses in the past on my pc but since I have had bitdefender never had a virus again..Iloved the setup for 2014 not so much the 2015 but it does great!
Leslie Francis,1,5,"I had some issues at the start, the team could not have been more helpful.The program is doing all I can ask of it, without my having to do much at all.Very light on usage, just goes about it business . Leslie"
Jerry Deen,1,1,"I am a bonafide buyer and my order number is 800127748 on June 30 2015. Still can not get it registered and have only put it on one of My PC's which I ma greatful for. It has slowed down PC and can not even go to my banking sight etc. No Tech support. It says only daytime hours When I call during the day they tell me to call at night and recording says no one their to take calls. Do not answer phone messages or E-mails. When I purchased it, it had a very high rating on top ten anti Virus sights. Now they are not even listed. It had to be a bogus rating.     I am trying to get a complete Refund so for with not even an answer. Beware if you buy they will Dissappear.....      Jerry From Central Illinoios."
STEVE B,6,5,I've had BD on my laptop for a couple of months now. Once it's all set up & running the experience is pretty much seamless & hassle free.
Graziano G Bonomo,3,4,I’ve been using this EXCELLENT Internet Security for almost 5 years….Never had a problem…..I also have it on my SmartphoneBut  I think is a bit Heavy for the system…..Could it be a bit lighter in the future?
Roy Gearing,11,5,"I have used Bit Defender protection since the early 2000's and have watched the programmes develop and meet the current demand and grow year on year with regular additional facilities. It operates in the background with minimal effect on performance and has grown to be extremely reliable. I have had one or two issues over this period and I have always received prompt attention and helpful and satisfactory responses, something many other service companies could do well to follow."
Macky Carroll,4,5,"i've been using Bitdefender Total Security for a few years. it is very easy to clean up my computer--that is, the optimize feature is wonderful; and i feel very protected with the tools and options involved. i've tried other security programs and none come close-- not slowing down my computer is an important option for me. the customer service folks are terrific and manage to help me every time i've needed help"
Thomas Levine,1,5,I had a difficult problem concerning traffic light with Google ChromeIt took five or six communications to resolve it. The people at bitdefender stuck patiently with me until it was solved. They were quick to respond to all the emails that I sent them.
Mike Beattie,4,5,"I´ve been using Bitdefender since 2010, and have been very pleased with it - simple to install and use, but with all the bells and whistles you could want if you need to customise it. My only grumble? As a loyal and repeat purchaser, why does Bitdefender invite me repeatedly to renew at a cost of $89.95 or its equivalent in £ or €, when as a new customer I can buy the product for less than £20 on the open market (e.g. Amazon) or, if I wait until the last minute, from Bitdefender at the same reduced price. Surely to offer existing customers renewal at the market, rather than the list, price would encourage more to continue to use the product."
Prasanna,1,5,Requested an upgrade from Bitdefender Total security 2015 to Bitdefender Multi devise and I received a favourable response from Bitdefender support team within 2 days
Michael Kalyaano,1,5,I have confidence in Bitdefender protecting my PC. The user interface is easy to use. I have had no problems with viruses or malware since using Bitdefender. I had one occasion to contact Bitdefender support and they responded quickly. I was completely satisfied with their response. I recommend Bitdefender to anyone looking for computer security software.
Glen Reeves,11,5,"Such a fantastic program.  Having tried and use many PC security programs, including McAfee, Norton, Kaspersky, Panda, F-Secure and Avira, I can honestly say that BifDefender is the best.  I would never ever trust my computers security to a free program, and there is also a reason why BitDefender comes TOP time after time with AV-Test.orgs independant testing.  I even managed to win a 5 licence year of the Norton Security free while at a large shopping centre by answering pc secuity questions at a Norton stand.  I still use BitDefender!"
william spaulding,1,1,"the product did not work .  The customer service was worthless.  The only constructive comments I got from customer service came after I took my computer into a computer store and I asked for a refund.  I do not have the software installed on any of my computers, it never worked properly and I have never received a refund even though I have requested it several times.  Twice while within the 30 day window and I have also requested a refund outside the window.  The biggest problem is that they do not offer any phone support.."
James Smith,1,5,Had a friend get me a code for the bit defender and attached it to my e-mail all without my okay. Later that week I bought bit defender and inquired about the old cd-key attached to my email. They assured me bot keys were legal. apparently the one the guy installed is a promotional key for 196 days.  Bit defender is the best security program I found especially for the buck. I build/fix/upgrade/repair systems for people and recommend bit defender now.
Jon Bouye,1,5,After trying Norton's and McAfee's and finding them to unsuitable I decided to try your product. That's almost a year ago and I couldn't be happier. I am confident my system is as secure I can make it at a cost I can afford. I have only had to contact support once and was astonished with the service I received. Everything was taken care of with only a single contact. I recommend this to all my friends and family.
Richard May,2,5,"Looking good so far.  Needed assistance with a language change, tech support immediately (within the hour?) emailed me back with detailed, accurate, polite instructions.  These days, that goes a hell of  long way - normally find that ""support"" is treated as a necessary evil, i.e. once we've had your money, adios!  Well to whom it may concern, the quick helpful professional advice I received was very much appreciated, and helps stand bitdefender out from the competition.   H/t, Bitdefender!"
Lawrence Lindstrand,7,5,I sent in my problem on Saturday realizing that I probably wouldn't get an answer on the weekend. Promptly Monday morning I did receive a reply detailing in great detail what I needed to do to solve the problem.  I followed the instructions and everything now works properly.  I wrote them and thanked them for the answer--they apologized for not getting back sooner.  Based on responses from other companies I thought Bit Defender's service is excellent.
Hilary Wharam,4,4,I am no computer guru. I depended on a relative who has recently died. Left to my own devices the Bitdefender team asked questions I didn't understand and then helped me to do what they asked. In the process I stumbled over a possible reason for my problem. I acted on the perceived problem and it appears to have resolved.
menorcarob,2,5,best anti virus system I have ever used and will continue to use
Andreas,1,5,"It's the BEST security programm i ever experienced with. I totaly recomment it. For the full edition, the price over value is certainly worth it. Immediate response to problem reports, very helpful to any questions and real professionals."
Abdulqader_Jasim,2,5,I don't have to worry about my system any more with Bit defender.
ken pharoah,2,5,Once i realised how to get the help i needed i had no problems. At first i was sending emails that were not adequately answered but generated an automatic response that did not address my problem. Better woukd have been a direct way to dealwith my individual problem or to explain clearly what i as a nonexpert needed to do. I got there in the end and thanks for that.
Tan Hee Chai,1,3,There is a problem with the secured banking websites. The problem is unable to log into the bank website when converted to secured bitdefender.
Bob Fraser,1,5,"Don't hesitate to subscribe to Bitdefender, especially if you are not tech-savvy & need frequent help resolving computer/printer issues."
Morten Mobrenna,7,5,"This is a very good program that gives you everything you need, and makes it very easy to stay protected and up to date!"
Dennis Rodgers,1,5,I am an IT Professional and have worked in the industry for 40 years. You can imagine I have dealt with a lot of software and hardware companies over the years and have experienced the best and the worst of our industry. I have been using Bitdefender Total Security on all of my home machines and the software and support our outstanding!In this day and age of fast paced life I have experienced amazing customer service from Bitdefender for 2 years and will continue to enjoy the great software and customer service from them. I have purchsed copies of the software for several friends that need security software just to work for non-technical people.
Lisa,4,5,"The service representative was friendly and spoke English very clearly. After I had registered my paid subscription to Bitdefender 2015 Anti-VirusPlus program, I couldn't sign into my account.  It only took a few minutes for the problem to be fixed.  Thanks!"
Paul,1,5,Bit Defender is the best program I really enjoy using it and the people they're are wonderful too talk too!!
Grant,1,5,"I've tried all the top rated antiviruses, and this is the best. Excellent customer service, easy controls, and most important - it DOES NOT slow down your computer, as the others do. Will buy again."
Penny Stute,2,1,"September 2016-update to review posted July 2015My experience with Bitdefender is not a positive one.  I last wrote regarding an experience I had with them last year about registry problems that was never resolved.  Today I am sharing my most recent experience, one that has caused me to terminate my service with Bitdefender completely. I hope this sounds like a review but it may sound a little like a rant. None the less the experiences are genuine.In early to mid July, my PC, a brand new Toshiba became infected with adware.  I contacted Botdefender and they referred me to Chrome tune up or cleaner, and to Bleeping Computer to run an adware cleaner.  Well the first two did not work, the adware returned with a vengeance. I did this procedure two or three times with no relief from the ads, they were on every site I visited. I had heard nothing from Bitdefender in the interim, so I found a site that advocated running five tools in sequence to get rid of adware infections.  Imagine my surprise to find that Bitdefender has their own adware removal tool and was number four on that site, yet never once was I referred to BD's tool!  I found this very disturbing.  So while running the tools, number three requested a reboot so I checked OK, and suddenly my PC shut down with an odor of smoke.  I thought it was going to burn up.  After that I could not start it again.  It would turn on and click right back off again. Couldn't reboot it in safe mode.  In the meantime I am still waiting for BD's response.  Finally I contacted the designer of the tool I was using when my PC malfunctioned and he  immediately provided me with information on how to fix my PC and then he offered to pay for the expense of repairing it if it was repairable.  Still no contact with BD.  Finally, I called a repair technician who was able to fix my PC, because I could not get it to boot, still no communication with BD.  By this time I was ticked so I went to BD's help screen and opened a live chat with one of their repair technicians. She/he was unable or did not look at the chat screen, and kept calling me by the wrong name.  I asked her why BD did not refer me to their adware removal tool and she refused to answer the question and again called me by a different name.  She never did answer my question but said that somebody would get back to me.  Within a few days, I got an email from the original technician blaming me again for not checking off an offer that caused the infection because according to her I had I apparently downloaded software.  The entire communication history was about her castigating me for something I had done wrong!  I am by no means a computer geek but I have used a PC long enough to know that when downloading something one never accepts the extra stuff that is offered, so I was getting pretty hot when she continued to accuse me of doing so.  Then she offered me two extra months of BD!  Like that was going to  begin to cover the cost of  the damage resulting from following her advice! And to really light my fire she told me that they were continuing to ""investigate"" the problem.  And this, without ever answering my question yet again about why I had not been referred to their adware removal tool.  But hey!  They are investigating right?  Needless to say, by this time I had had enough of the investigating, the blame and accusations, the unanswered question, and the slap in the face offer of two months free BD, so I experessed my thoughts about the entire experience, still remembering last years experience with the registry issues, and have not heard from BD since.  This entire experience began in early to mid July.So, in summary and secondary to both of my experiences with BD, my thoughts are that BD can not be counted on to provide adequate protection to my PC's, their customer service is a joke and one must pay for their mistakes,  their chat technicians are unable to read and answer simple questions, BD has no confidence in their own software to protect their suscribers PC's, and  BD does not mind somebody else picking up the tab for their mistakes.  And finally, I suspect they are no longer ""investigating.""By the way, I did not accept the software designer's offer to repair my PC.  As far as I am concerned BD was responsible and I refuse to extort an innocent company. I picked up the tab.So any positive reviews I have written in the past are definintley negated by my previous two negative experiences with BD.  I am thoroughly disgusted by the service I have experienced with BD, and I hope you readers have not had similar experiences, but I caution you to be wary when requesting assistance from BD if your PC becomes infected~*~"
wes,1,5,What are your plans for  Windows 10?
surya,1,5,everything is good about bitdefender except the user interface.those colours look like sturdy.kaspersky user interface is better.
Wayne Worrell,1,5,"In 2 words, ""amazing service"" second to none that I have come across before.My computer crashed and I could not get into C drive and had to format, unfortunately I had lost my license key, I wrote directly to Bitdefender Support Center and with in 20 minutes they had written back and answered my question with my license key.Great service, keep up the good work and again thank you."
Gerald Herbst,1,3,I still don't know why I had to remove Malwarebytes from my PC.  I miss it because it seemed to find malware that would harm my PC and I don't see the save results with Bitdefender.  I check my setting and they seem to be set for everything I should have.  I also don't like Safepay at all. Its to confusing for me and I can't open my Wallet when I use Safepay. I wish it was easier to use.
Fred Stanvic,1,5,"Bitdefender is the least intrusive, has minimal system overhead and just works.Highly recomended"
jerome,2,5,"not very computer literate, i felt a bit overwhelmed by my problem and by the prospect of contacting bitdefender. I should not have worried as my problem was solved very quickly and made me feel I knew what I was doing. I am a very satisfied and loyal customer. Thank you bitdefender"
Fahad,3,5,"I used Internet security and Total security and I can say it helped me a lot on not effecting my connection while playing online games as some other security products do.  it has a gaming mode which automatically switches on, when you play anygame, but to not be too optimistic the game mode doesn't start automatically with some games if they were on window mode. but doesn't affect the over all experience.I highly suggest it for gamers."
Hamad Alobaidallah,1,5,"Intelligent, caring, and strong security.That defines Bitdefender.Always safe, any threat has been detected is dealt with right away. No pressure on the PC, runs smooth.They have a feature called  ( autopilot ) whatever you do, like: watching movies, playing or working, it adapt to it, so for example, while you are playing it disables anything running on the back ground that would slow your PC, and the same for anything you do. And it's optional too. Also they have a feature called startup optimizer, which it would disables or delay the apps that you have selected when you turn on your PC. And that makes the PC start faster. Moreover, one of my favorite features, OneClick Optimizer, it cleans the PC, browsers, deleted files... And lots more.The customer service, is fantastic! They don't take a long time to respond and solve the problem. Even if you don't know how to solve it, like what key should you press, they will tell you that. And they will keep contact you until your problem has been solved. And that what made me love Bitdefender even more, plus the high security.Highly recommended, try it for one year and you will see what I am talking about. You will see for yourself you won't regret it."
doug,1,5,Have been using this for 2-3 years and not 1 single problem encountered.Forgot password - contacted support who responded promptly with more info than needed to resolve issue.
John W. Kershaw,1,4,"My experience with Bitdefender Total Security 2015 has been varied. Let me start with the good news and then end with the poor part. Currently, I am thrilled to bits with the product. I've played around with it and used various options, finally setting it up the way I want it. At that point, I could pretty much just forget about it. My security report is ready each week, I look it over, take a look at the logs to ensure everything is up to date, then carry on. Yes, I love Autopilot mode !!!! I've found Bitdefender to be great for technical support and reasonably quick at turnaround time. I rate response time for security products much more harshly than most others, given the obvious. I give Bitdefender a tip of the hat and a 'well done'. Especially for almost instantly fixing the disaster created by one of their resellers in Utah.The 'experience' with the reseller would be best described as a major cluster f**k. Essentially, the product code they supplied was incorrect and the installation instructions for the bonus software were utter dross as well as yet again, having the incorrect key. Let us just say that it went back and forth in a true Keystone Kops fashion, but maddening to the extreme rather than slapstick. I've kept the email chain just as a stellar example of how NOT to conduct after sales service. Its the kind of 'script' that John Cleese could make brilliant in one of his business videos :).As to Bitdefender? After 3 weeks building Bedlam with the reseller, sent a quick note to Bitdefender themselves with the reseller email chain attached. They sent me back, the next day, simple, succinct and correct steps to install the software. Ergo, beware who the reseller is...... Product recommended."
Owen Pritchard,8,5,"Easy to contact, quick to respond. Knowledgeable and helpful."
JJ Sheek,2,5,"A good company that has an extremely capable customer services team that are easy to contact and fast to respond over e-mail. Would definitely recommend if you are  able with computers but aren't too sure on the technical side of things. Bitdefender are providing new technologies often and these are extremely easy to use. I feel in control and secure with my antivirus. I would however not recommend the windows 8 version but, if like me you decide to give it a try, the team will switch it with a different product if you are unsatisfied."
Manlif Barnes,1,4,"The last two times I have purchased updates I have experienced problems. Also, when I call customer service, I have difficulty understanding the technician some times. Their accent and rapid talk make it very difficult understanding them. Once it get the product up and running, it works well except it often interferes with my use of my computer when it is updating the antivirus protection."
Amogh Gokhale,1,5,"Installing Bitdefender Product using Online Installer method takes considerable time, but it chooses automatically the required 32bit or 64bit version as per your operating system.Fastest Method for installation of Bitdefender Product is download the required version - offline installer, and then run and install in required computer.Installation procedure is carried out fast.Every time you start your computer, it takes considerable time, means very long boot time due to Bitdefender product.However, after computer boot is complete, no lag in using computer due to bitdefender.PC Scan and Virus Definition update is very Fast.Customer Support - Especially Chat Support and Email Support is best that I have experienced till today.Overall - Value for Money."
Bird,1,5,"I am IT-challenged and mangle up a pc. With BD autopilot I feel secure. I have only had BDIS 2015 for about two weeks now and have made a few phone calls. I can convey my problem live and BD support has resolved it on the spot. The 24/7 telephone is a deal-breaker for me.For me, going back and forth via email for support is a very cumbersome as I am not IT-savvy and to be able to speak to a human being that knows their product (and it is a good product) is like I said a deal-breaker. Their is another bit of security software that I use that doesn't have phone support and I wait an average of 2.5 days for a response which doesn't mean I able to interpret it and resolve my issue. I grow weary of playing email tag for support. It like everyone assumes that I am IT-savvy.BitDefender's  the way to go for me. Thank you."
George Finizio,1,5,My experiences with both the Bitdefender Products as well as the tech support of the Bitdefender team have all been stellar so far. It's GREAT to have an excellent product with round the clock friendly and professional assistance for the product if it's needed. I am NOT a novice user either but do have a lot of experience on computers!
Aramstrong Douglas,1,5,"Bitdefender was the best choice I made to keep my system safe and working fine. Uses few resources, scans very fast and has a great support."
kracker1963,2,5,"I have tried other top name products before, and now I dont have the worries that come with product updates, protection or user interaction. Simple and effective.  Just install and let it do its magic!  I am a 100% satisfied believer and customer, Every year!"
Barry Z. Rose,2,5,"I was alerted to problem(s) in my computer, described the problems to BitDefender Support, and problem(s) were solved.  What more can a computer user want?  Thank you, BD, for being there for me."
Dylan,1,5,"The Bitdefender team went above and beyond my expectations to solve my issue.  This is the kind of customer service that is rarely seen anymore, but will keep me coming back year after year."
Roger Smith,1,5,"I have used various Bitdefender products for years and have a satisfaction level of 99.9% positives to report, and only once did I have to reply to advice in a negative manner and with their reply the misunderstanding was resolved, actually I feel I am being very harsh by even mentioning it. I feel that I will always use Bitdefender products as my first choice."
Dan,1,5,"Product is awerall good, no flse alarms so far. I had an issue with the older product on the new OP system, but after updating and following the steps of the representative, everything seems to be working fluently.It would be nice if the program could detect update/upgrade necessities and maybe warn th user for the most known incomptible programs, but all in all I am a satisfied customer and would recommend using Bitdefender Total Security to anyone!5/5 from me."
Craig K,2,5,"I have 3 computers that I bought Bitdefender for.  Two of the are Win 8.1 64 bit and the third one is Win XP 32 bit.  The downloaded software couldn't be run/installed on the XP 32 bit machine.  Tech support walked me through the getting the correct software and installation on the 32 bit machine, no questions asked!  Great to see a company care for their customers so promptly and efficiently."
Sal,1,5,Bitdefender Total Security 2015 is an excellent product. It has been tested by independent companies and has always been highly rated. I have been very satisfied with its operation on all my computers. I did have one problem and contacted Bitdefender for assistance. They quickly discovered that my problem was related to the fact that I had other security products on my computer that were not compatible with Bitdefender. Once I followed their instructions on how to remove these products the problem was gone. The Bitdefender team responded very quickly to my request for assistance and offered expert assistance. They know how to keep your computer safe from all the many threats out there.
Liisa Hirvonen,1,5,"I had a small issue, and Bitdefender solved it quickly and what matters most: understandable.This company has taken the customer support to a totally different level than other firms."
Gin P Khup,2,5,The customer service is exceptional
Ben  Fernández,4,5,"Blue screens started appearing shortly after installing bitdefender,I assumed it was the cause, however it was corrupt windows files which a very helpful member of staff then proceeded to help me correct and get back to normal.fast efficient staff.very impressed."
Vicki Richard,2,5,I love this product.  I was in a big hurry and did not read all the directions carefully and accidentally ordered two of the same products when it came time to renew.  I explained the situation to the Customer Service Dept. and they offered me an easy solution to my problem--they extended one of the renewals and gave me many more days protection than I deserved.  What a company!
Burgie,2,5,"I have had Bitdefender for a few years, and have been in the IT field for many years. Bitdefender is by far the best anti virus I have ever used. And they are always available for your needs. Highly recommend them."
Bill Bruecken,1,5,"I HAVE USED BITDEFENDER PC SECURITY FOR THREE YEARS. THE TECH PERSONEL HAVE RESOLVED ALL PROBLEMS IN A CURTIOUS , SWIFT RESPONSIBLE & COMPLETE WAY. I HAVE ONLY ONE AREA OF CONCERN & THAT IS IN USING DATA PROTECTION. WHEN REVIEWING MY FUNDS,BANKING ACCOUNTS ETC. THE INTERFERENCE INVOLVED IS SO EXTENSIVE THAT I WON`T USE THAT FUNCTION."
Donna Trahan,3,5,"After downloading Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2016 on a 3rd laptop, it did not work. I contacted Customer Care through a chat session, explained that it seemed to download correctly, it showed that it uninstalled the previous version then downloaded the current version. I was told that through the download process Bitdefendeder does not uninstall the previous version. I had to do that first, then download the new version. He told me to uninstall Bitdefender, restart laptop, then download the new version. We ended our chat session and I did just as he told me. I had no problems getting it to work then. But, there were 203 updates, so I let it run the updates first. This laptop had Windows 8. It took almost 4 hours, then I got a pop-up that it could not complete the updates and would be undoing the changes, not to turn off the computer. So I left it on, closed the lid at the end of the day, brought it home, and the next day when I opened the laptop it was still undoing the changes. It stayed at least 4 hours undoing the changes, then gave a message that Bitdefender was ""uninstalled""! I was a bit upset after all that time, but when I looked in the program files it was still installed. I successfully ran a full scan, had no viruses, etc.  I don't think I will ever run updates again when there are that many. I wish there was a way to get a list of the updates and you could check off the ones you want, all those regarding virus's. Windows 8 has a lot of conflicts and updating files sometimes messes it all up!"
g mihelis,1,5,I am very satisfy with cooperation and perfect security of my pc.
anthony s jackman,4,5,i got first class help and sorted my problem pretty quick thank u so much for the help
tommaras,2,5,"If there is a better virus protection on the market,  I haven't found it!"
Goochy,1,5,"I really appreciate the way that this company helps to resolve any technical issues 24/7 , and they were fast and friendly. The software found plenty of fixes and everything that I already suspected with Kaperskey came true."
Norm Tilley,1,5,"One email & options were given, these resolved my problem."
Sara Castle,2,4,I haven't used it much because I didn't get it registered until I'd had it almost two months.
Dennis M Carey,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender since 2012, and during that time I have not had a single virus infect either my desktop or laptop!  I have been in the IT industry for almost 30 years now, and Bitdefender is the only anti-virus and anti-spyware product I recommend to my friends and family.The only time I needed to interact with the support team they were very professional, courteous and resolved my issue (which was with licensing, not the product itself) within the same day."
Tom Pullen,2,5,"The program is so simple that there is hardly anything to evaluate.  You install it and it takes over all of your antivirus protection automatically.  You can tweak it with the Settings option, but it is pretty much perfect right ""out of the box"".  I had a small problem with the Wallet app, but an email to Tech Support got me the answer within ten minutes.  They know what they are doing, and they do it well.  Couldn't be better."
Craig Worcester,1,5,"I recently purchased Bitdefender Antivirus, following a recommendation.  Having used an alternative solution before, I was faced with an installation issue. It wasn't a Bitdefender issue, but the old software determined not to uninstall properly. The customer care team at Bitdefender made sure this was not an issue for me and solved my problem quickly and effectively by providing clear and precise instructions.  A very polite and helpful bunch of people with a excellent technical knowledge that they easily translated to a novice like me. They have a great product too. I can't recommend them enough. I am extremely happy with my decision to buy Bitdefender and have already Tweeted and put out a Facebook recommendation to all my friends.Craig - Devon. UK"
Terry Akkerman,1,5,"I actually never heard of Bitdefender until I looked up security software that could be downloaded off of the internet for one PC with a mobile device subscription as well. I also found the price to be extremely reasonable. For $35.00 a year for both devices, you just cannot beat that. I might add by the way, that the software is simple, has added features for upgrades & those are priced reasonably as well. Their support department is on the ball! For someone who just needs protection browsing the web & a few optimizing tools, this is the security software for you."
Gary Brighton,2,5,"Bitdefender always scores highly in reviews and living with it could not be simpler. Used to use McAfee but the annual renewal was always such a hassle, having to fully uninstall and reinstall new licences if you didn't pay their ridiculous standard renewal prices. TIP, as with all these products, buy your renewal from Amazon or similar for a fraction of the price their own website offers. The good news with Bitdefender is you buy a code which you simply type into the program already installed and job done.  As to how simple it is, I use a 3 licence pack to cover both our parents PCs and it is fire and forget!"
Levente Paizs,2,5,They resolved my issue in a fast and expert way. One of the best customer services I ever got.
Kevin Stendal,1,4,"I got the Bitdefender Family Pack so I was installing the software on multiple devices (desktop PCs, laptops, phones...).  Of course, with so many installations on different systems, I had questions about how to tailor each insstallation.  The Bitdefender Customer Support team is incredibly responsive.  I exchanged 15 emails with the team asking about different aspects of the product.  In spite of my MANY inquiries, I received a prompt and thorough response each time (including step-by-step instructions when i needed them).  Very impressed thus far with the customer support.  I am keeping my review at 4 stars only because this is my first experience with Bitdefender.  If the product continues to work well and Bitdefender continues to offer this level of support for the next year until I renew my subscription, I would unhesitatingly give them 5 stars."
Robin Jones,4,5,"The Bitdefender Total Security suite is, as its title suggests, a comprehensive set of tools. Apart from the usual antivirus and firewall, there are Web protection features that monitor sites that have been compromised or contain phishing or other fraud tools. It also monitors your update status and will manage system updates for you if you wish. Often, it notices an available update before Windows does.There are various other useful features. For instance, the Wallet stores passwords (among other data) and populates Web site forms automatically from them. Safepay enables you to log into a banking site without entering keystrokes so that keylogging isn't possible.Altogether, a well thought out, easy to use and reliable suite of programs!"
Lorenzo M,1,5,"...I would just like to say that from my first operating system in December 2008, I have always used this product Bit defender, and  have been recommending it to all my friends ever since the first install. Bravo to the bit defender team. And in conclusion i would highly recommend this product to anyone with a computer.Best RegardsLorenzo"
Falasca,1,5,"I had an issues, after setup BitDefender. I sent a e-mail and they respond really quickly.They was really good!"
Danilo,1,5,"I am using this antivirus for three years, and I never had a serious problem. It's very confident, and doesn't slow down an operating system. Once I had a problem, customer care team responded to me pretty quickly, and explained very well how to solve the issue."
Stephen Coleman,1,4,"bitdefender has done an excellent job untill the last week or so.  I use google chrome as my browser and I have found a redirect virus from somewhere.  Every hour or so I have to shut down chrome completely when I am redirected to a site for Rivera Tech Support.   there is a recorded message as well as a drop down instructing me to call 1 844 952 7284,  The only thing I can do is use the task manager to shut down the browser completely.  I need some help and I believe this virus is masking my searches for it.  Can someone help me please?"
MuhammadAwad Farag,1,5,"I used 2013, 2014 and 2015 Internet Security of Bitdefender, and year after year I found it more and more comfort and affective in dealing with all kind of threats specially this last one 2015."
Aiden Canepe,1,5,"Is honestly the best Anti-Virus software out there. Most other Anti-Virus softwares effect the performance of your PC but Bitdefender dosen't atall thanks to the amazing technology behind it. With Auto Pilot on you never have to worry about anything and even if you do Bitdefender sorts it straight away. A must have Anti-Virus, would reccomend to all"
Tony Anderson,1,5,"I was one of the Norton Antivirus beta tester in the beginning. One day, I plugged in a usb that contains some very dangerous virus (I would say it very serious). The norton software didn't scan the usb which I thought It should have started. Anyway I tell the it to scan and eventually it found something. However, this is where the trouble started, I used the setting fix automatically and I was so naive to think that everything is Ok. The next restart norton stopped working and it wouldn't update either. My friend tell me try Bitdefender and scan again. So I removed the Norton and try Bitdefender IS 2015. Weirdly, Bitdefender finished the system scan without any positive. The next restart the virus kicked in, they blocked me from open exe file, command exe, registry editor. They even blocked the system restored and window backup. I was all about to think that I would have to re installed the whole window system again to get rid of the virus. Luckily I decided to contact Bitdefender support team to see if they could help me. And after a dozen of emails and a couple of days, I have fixed by my all. I wrote this review, first to compliment Bitdefender for their wonderful customer service, secondly to encourage everyone who in need of system protection to give Bitdefender a try. About my case, I would say that it is very serious that normal user can't handle it even with the Bit team help and may have to send their laptop to fix for a few day. About Norton, I didn't think their service is not good enough, I did this because the situation was really bad and I have to take any other way to fix my laptop. Anyway Norton was in the beta phase so everything can go wrong. Perhaps I will try Norton antivirus again really soon."
Kate Gabriel-Jones,1,5,"I've been a happy BitDefender customer for 3 years and every experience I have had reinforces the excellent customer service and the protection is top notch with an exceptionally easy layout.  Recently, BitDefender even helped me figure out how to fix an issue with Google Chrome!  And, when a tragic death in my family derailed my planned schedule for technological correspondence, the customer service representatives at BitDefender were respectful, applied no pressure (even though it took me almost 3 weeks to get back to my computer issue) AND they helped me figure out my problem while providing superb education and customer support.  BitDefender is THE BEST!!"
LARRY  PATRIE,1,5,I found bitdefender a very good product. I highly recommend this product because the quality is as good or better than other antiviruses.
Mark CLark,2,5,"I took advantage of the ""free"" download Microsoft offered for Windows 10. Turns out that my version of Bitdefender was not compatible! I contacted Bitdefender via telephone, and I was back in operation in less than 5 minutes! You guys are the best!"
Bryan Elsner,1,5,I finally got weary of tweaking and adjusting antivirus software installations.  After installing Bitdefender Free Antivirus I found that no adjustments were offered because adjustments are not needed!It just works great the way it installs itself.Outstanding!
Darius Damon,1,5,Bitdefender is the best security solution out there! its Autopilot feature lets you use your computer with absolute ease! just turn it on and forget everything!
Eva Switch,1,4,excellent light protection even though it failed to delete a specific adware.  really helpful customer support.
Big Jon G,1,3,The customer service rep that helped me get registered had a very heavy accent and spoke quietly making it a less than desirable experience.
Copel Marcus,1,5,"Bitdefender has taken an active role in my PC life for several years. Every time I start the laptop, it insists that I take car of security business before I get on with my day. Today I experienced first-class customer service on the phone when I needed a little help installing my new Bitdefender. IO strongly recomnmend Bitdfender."
Bella Braganza,1,5,"I have found that, not only is Bitdefender Total Security the best security software on the market, but their support team is amazing and so helpful"
Christina S.,1,5,"The Bitdefender Total Security product is one of the best internet security products I've ever used (been using computers since the mid 80's). The level of security is among the best. I'm constantly connected to the internet so solid security is important. The installation was very easy. The user interface is easy to use and understand. I've requested assistance twice and both times the customer service was prompt, very helpful and follow up was great. One issue was to add an additional device to my existing license (they made it extremely easy and fair) and the second was to move a device from a trial account to my existing license (again very easy). I'm extremely pleased with Bitdefender Total Security and will be renewing with them later this year when my current license expires."
Michael,2,5,This is the best virus/malware protection I've ever used. I love all the special features included. The customer service is excellent. Some other products I've used have taken days for customer service to get back to you after you notify them of a problem. Bitdefender gets back to you immediately. I also like that you can reach them by phone quickly and they are very pleasant to work with.
Dave Menga,1,5,My issue was handled promptly and with procedural steps that I could understand and follow without help. Nicely done!
Graham Houghton,1,5,"This product does precisely what it says on the can.  It does it quietly and efficiently without razzamatazz or fuss of any sort.  I wouldn't be without it on my machine, nor would I use any other AV product.  I get popup ads for it quite frequently which is annoying as I am a user.  Perhaps they could build in some sort of code that recognises users' machines so it can avoid them and leave their happy customers in peace.  Shouldn't be too hard for the folks at BD.  Buy it, particularly when it's on offer at a discount."
Walter Benotto,1,5,This is my second year using Boyfriends. For what I have paid for total security  it is very cost effective  and does a very excellent job of protecting my computers. I would  have no issue recommending it to anyone.
Bob Pratt,4,5,"I changed to Bitdefender Internet Security on the recommendation of a friend and am very happy that I did. The interface is easy to use and understand, the range of protection is excellent, it runs smoothly without problems on my Win7 64 bit and the customer service first class. A problem I had accessing a particular site was addressed and solved the next day, I then received a follow up email asking for confirmation all was now well. They may well have millions of customers but manage to deliver a personal service. Recommended."
Donald GALLEY,1,5,"I purchased this program primarily as a virus protection. I found it did much more and provided services which were not anticipated or expected. The wallet, optimizers,  safebox etc. were all great bonus features."
Christopher,9,5,"Initially, I couldn't download updates - but support got back to me very quickly, and I have a product which works better than my previous AV - seemingly not having a performance impact."
Bill Fisher,3,5,"found bitdefender almost by default,but really pleased i did, would recommend them highly both for their product and their customer care"
Abdel Nasser Ali,2,4,"I think BitDefender is a well-designed and fully-featured security suite, performance and ease of use. It also offers fine level of customer service, including the ability to reach a customer care technician.But I don't know why the firewall is stop working when upgrade windows 8 to 8.1."
Rickey Cowan,1,5,"Reasonable price, excellent protection, and very good customer service."
Søren Schack,6,4,"Very simple and clear user interface, Well done!"
Rene LeBlanc,1,5,I am using Bitdefender Total Security 2015. On a number of occasions it has detected phishing attempts and several viruses that I somehow encountered even when not accessing any seemingly risky browser links. Bitdefender has been an unobtrusive ally that increases my confidence that my computer is being well protected against the increasingly sophisticated evil threats in the Internet.
Dale Beckman,1,5,"Normally when one has computer problems you hope for some help, but normally it takes some time, and often receive a generalized response which may or may not help.Over the years I have experienced the pleasure of dealing with a real person who shows that they care, and do work to provide the appropriate solution.The BitDefender service is so good that if they don't hear from you they follow up to make sure that you get your problem solved. Outstanding!"
Anthony Feimann,1,5,First class product and service.Total security and piece of mind!
John,2,5,"It's an actual antivirus which can distinguish a virus from a new unrecognized file or crack ect Over 12 months of use and I've had 1 false positive from a poker app, not a single virus and I've had one bad download which it caught right away, now if I was using avast or norton I'd have a million warings of trojans from the odd program I try from torrents always having to make exceptions ect, yet not with Bitdefender, it's clever enough to know whats a virus weather its a new file or not.  As somebody who torrents every now and again to test a new game/program ect I can trust Bitdefender to keep my pc safe from the odd unsavoury copyright revolutionary."
Glen,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender Total Security for almost a year now and I'm very impressed with this product.  It provides broad coverage, operates unobtrusively and seems to provide great protection.  I recently acquired a 4th PC and called the support line to add another user on my (3 PC) license.  The support person was very responsive and made the adjustment very quickly."
Tentaclejay,1,5,Feel secure after dumping the McAfee that Dell insists on installing on their computers.  It is the most ineffective anti-virus I have ever used.  Reinstalled my Bit defender after uninstalling McAfee with the software provided by Bit Defender.  Very convenient !!   Feel properly protected again.  Thanks bit Defender !!!
Ugonna Cypril Okpe,1,4,"I am Emmanuel from Nigeria. I started using bitdefender antivirus since 2012 when I saw it rated as the most effective antivirus. I am using Total security, and have confirmed that it is just as stated in the rating. efficiency almost 100 per cent. My only problem is the price, as a result of Nigerian dollar exchange rate. Bitdefender, you are tested and trusted!"
Jeremy,3,5,"I've used Bitdefender Internet Security happily for several years but needed to renew and also upgrade from 2013 version to 2015 version.  I followed instructions and the entire process was almost automated from removing the old version to installing and updating the new version.  Above all, it gave me reassurance that I was being protected during the process.  And it added the remaining days from my old license to the new one.  Brilliant.  Why use anything else?"
Paul Bosch,1,5,I would and have strongly recommend to my associates and friends to use Bitdefender on their Mobile and Computer systems.
Bob Joanne Vanderaegen,1,5,"This product is the best antivirus, anti-spam and anti-phishing product on the market. When I needed support, I received an immediate request ticket and a very quick response with point-by-point instructions on how to address the issue. It worked flawlessly, thank youR.Vanderaegen"
Chris,2,5,"Bitdefender Total Security 2015. I had to contact their customer service department recently regarding a special offer they were running to celebrate their AV comparatives award,  they were quick to respond, very helpful and ensured I was completely satisfied with the outcome."
Marc Van Hoof,32,5,"The most anti virus programs ar havvy to run but Bitdefender runs lite and smooth. It also take sudden tasks out of hand, like windows and other updates. So give it a try to get the best protection using innovative technology."
Matt,2,5,"This is the best AV out there. It has everything you need. The client is really simple to use. There are also useful tools such as a wallet where you can store your login accounts. And one of the features I love most is the Bitdefender safe pay. This allows you to pay online without any concern. As I said, 10/10 would buy Bitdefender again."
Vasudevan Venugopal,1,5,"A couple of years ago Bitdefender, while effective, was slow and the customer support was not up to the mark, which made me choose some other Internet Security then. After reading relevant reviews I now chose Bitdefender internet Security 2014. I made the right decision. It is very effective and light on the system's resources. The customer support is lightning best. Thank you Bitdefender."
Rose Putnam,1,5,"I was so tired of the high price of computer repairs due to crashes, hacking or needing a professional tune up.  The first two times I signed up for Bitdefender I only went for one year. It was such a pleasant experience not to worry about my computer. It runs smoothly, quickly and without any issues. And, on occasion when I have had an issues Bitdefender came to my rescue and solved the problem immediately without additional costs. This last time I renewed my account I went for a 3 year stretch, saved me money and I am worry free. I should also mention I had some trouble downloading Bitdefender but when I complained they offered me a fantastic deal whereupon they installed the program, cleaned and tuned up my computer by remote. I did not have to be on the phone or in front of my computer the entire time. It doesn't get more convenient than that. I have two computers and a laptop all with bitdefender on them and at one low cost. I love bitdefender and highly recommend it. It is money well spent."
Wes,3,5,"Since i have started using bit-defender years ago i have yet to see any flaws in it. Never have any issues what-so-ever, including no slowdowns for my computer at all!. The customer support is very helpful when i needed it . And the system is so easy i rarely have to use them. in the 4 years ive used costumer support on 1 occasion, and my problem was sorted out within 5-10 minutes. Thank You bit-defender for the great products that never cease to satisfy. I would and (do) recommend to all my friends/family to ((((Use this product))))"
John Kerwin,3,5,Had a problem which required the use of Bitdefender Support & after two attempts to resolve was fixed. Considering the time zone I'm in I consider this the best support I've ever had in 20 years from any kind of support desk. Bitdefender is Tops & would recommend to anyone.
sfcurling,2,3,The download instructions are somewhat confusing and different than other programs I have downloaded. Due to my own confusion I paid for two items I did not need.  No one at Bitdefender  has addressed my overpayment or come through with a refund.  I would recommend the program except for this issue.
JOORIA Satay Baruth,1,5,"I had sent 3 emails before. I was completely disappointed on having no reply. After that I noticed that I was emailing on wrong address. Once I have been in contact with the Support Team, in only one day everything was settled down. I even contacted one of the member on phone and He immediately responded and sent me an email within minutes and solved all my problem. I really do not know how to thank him. Moreover, it's only after the phone call that I realized, it was night time in America as in Mauritius it was 2 PM and with the difference of 12 hours, it was 2 AM in America. In spite of  that, the Member Team gave me all the necessary Support. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN."
Mohammad,1,5,I am an Iranian . I 'm in love with BitDefenderBitDefender is the best anti virusI want to buy my version of Internet SecurityThank you
Kim,3,5,A couple of years ago I had a VERY bad experience with Norton.  Very bad.  I then did a Google search and Bitdefender came out on top.  I have had it for a couple of years with no problems at all.  My husband recently bought a new computer and decided to get Bitdefender too.  He found a great deal on the internet for 3 years.  Since mine was due for renewal soon I decided to take up the same offer.  I expected the customer service at Bitdefender to make that a difficult transition.  Most places won't let you start a brand new subscription at a good price if you are already a customer.  Not a problem with Bitdefender.  Sorted the transition with a couple of emails.  A relief on many levels.
Jonathan R,1,5,"I've been using BitDefender Total Security since 2011 and have found the software extremely effective, very good value, dependable and non-intrusive, with a beautifully simply and elegant interface.I really value many of the additional tools it comes loaded with, particularly the Wallet and SafePay tools.In addition, I have always found the BitDefender team to be very polite, friendly, accommodating and quick to respond to any issues I may have had."
Margaret Lee,1,5,I am very happy with the level of protection provided by the Bitdefender program.  I am very pleased with the price and the fact that I am given the option each year to renew early for a special price.  The few times I have had to contact Bitdefender Customer Service with a question or a problem I have received an answer or solution very quickly.
Tanya McKew,3,5,Nothing but praise for Bitdefender at how my question was dealt with. Fantastic customer service.
Ruth Arotsky,1,5,"I tried Bitdefender for 30 days and when trial expired I was looking for some product info, pricing discounts, etc. The customer service reps went above and beyond in my opinion, were very courteous, knowledgeable, efficient and very willing to help me. I loved that I was able to communicate with the same rep and not someone knew each time. The Bitdefender products speak for themselves because they are so amazing and with the awesome customer service I must say that by far Bitdefender is the best."
Fg Chan,1,5,BT.was very workable.I like it very much.
mohammad,1,5,this antivirus the best
erwin,1,5,Using it and I'm very satisfied. It's very light and give me protection which I'm looking for.Now all of my family's device is already using BitDefender AntiVirus and i would recommend this product to whom i known which might be concerns about their security and protection.
Steph Wanamaker,1,5,in 2 years only had 1 issue and when I went on live chat support  had someone come on i 60 seconds and they solved my problem within 5 minutes! 100% satisfied with knowledgeable staff and superior product
Mr LC,2,5,"Easy to communicate with, professional support, solve issues quickly, easy to use, useful features, reliable, not very resource-heavy (win7), im very happy with the product i use (internet security) and would consider recommending and upgrading."
Bogdan,1,4,Thanks for the support received from Bitdefender representatives . I was helped to solve a problem that I encountered when installing the software.I was a little difficult to understand the role and how I can generate a support log.I think that would be useful if this tool can be accessed easily.I also think it would be better if we find more information about this tool directly in your website.
Siobhan Justin,1,5,"so far, Bitdefender seems to work well. I just wish, though, that I could get rid of about:blank. Nothing I've tried has worked."
Bethania,1,5,"I really am new to this antivirus, I used for years Symantec products I had Norton Internet Security, and now I feel so good because this product is outstanding!. My dealer recomended it greatly and he really was right!!I am starting to get accustomed to this product.And thanks a lot for the smooth perfomance and low memory usage!!Beth"
j. Deeley,2,5,"This is my third year using Bitdefender and I have'nt had any reason to change.For the first time, just recently I had occasion to seek the help of their support team. I found the team very professional in their interaction with me.  The gave me the information necessary to solve my problem in a prompt and easy to understand manner. Full credit to all concerned."
Victor Moses,1,5,"I bought a new desktop, installed Bitdefender 2015, and was unable to get a wireless connection to the internet.  I was able to get a wired connection.  The computer vendor indicated that the problem was with Bitdefender.  I was able to connect after uninstalling Bitdefender but the problem returned after I rebooted the WS.  As it turned out the problem was resolved after vendor upgraded the driver of the wireless cardI was really impressed with the responses and assistance that I got from Bitdefender throughout it all.  Their trouble-shooting strategies were impressive and it enabled me to convince the vendor that the problem was not with Bitdefender.It is truly refreshing to find a company with a responsive customer care department and one that goes beyond the ""call of duty"".  By the way - I was able to get Bitdefender to offer a special licensing arrangement to me: 5-users (WS) and 3 years.  Now that's service!"
NII ADJEIDU ARMAR,4,5,"I have been using Bidefender for several years now and I can confidently say that this is a wonderful product, and the back-up service which goes with it is fantastic!!"
dot roberts,2,5,easy and quick download and installationany problems tackled immediatelyearly days for me but have full confidence in product and companyrecommended to me by son who is delighted with bitdefenderam recommending it to anyone who will listen!
Pamela,1,5,I highly recommend Bitdefender to keep your computer safe and secure. I have also contacted their  company  with a  question and received  a quick reply.  The  exemplary customer service from a real  person makes this company out shine many others. Thanks Bitdefender  for meeting all my needs for making my  computer safe and secure.
Sujit S Nair,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender Total security for four years now. To be honest I have had issues with some settings in the past. But none of them lasted more than 24 hours thanks to the customer care team at Bitdefender. I have had a safe journey all along with Bitdefender on my side. Keep up the good work guys and gals.
Ted French,1,5,"Could not install Bitdefender on new PC. Went to support, and the return email had a link to load a new copy and the key to authorize it. When I originally bought Bitdefender, I received a phone call from their support team just checking to be sure I had no problems installing or setting it up. I highly recommend Bitdefender, not only cause it does a good job, but also because the support is second to none.."
Lisa Zillich,1,5,"I am on a 90 day trial.  I have used McAfee for years.  Because of Bitdefender's great reputation with the independant testing labs, I took them up on their offer of the 90 day trial of Total Security 2015.  They are lightning fast at boot time and I love the constant scanning that they do.  As all AV programs that are not cloud based, they are a little heavy on the system because my webpage loading speeds improved dramatically when I uninstalled the program.  However, they are not as heavy as McAfee.  They also don't bother you with constant pop-ups like McAfee does.  Also with McAfee, they have contracted with Yahoo so McAfee auto-configures your computer to use Yahoo.  I would rather have my choice of browsers and not be forced to use a certain one.  With Bitdefender, you can contact customer support by chat at anytime.  The customer service team had to escalate my ticket to the experts and it takes a couple of days for them to get back to you but when they do, they provide you with thorough instructions on what to do amd to let them know if you run into any problems.  I like it that they are concerned about what you think about their product.  They have had a great reputation for years and they also have a large amount of free tools to help people clean up their computers.  I think the Total Security package has a lot of features and you get your moneys worth.  Customer Service also will help you through issues that you have, and it appears that they are humble enough to still try to constantly improve."
stepenwolf,1,5,I have dealt with C C Team couple of times over last 18 months.On each occasion they have dealt with problem in Professional way.I recommend Bitdefender team and products to anyone who needscomputer protection and professional help.
stephen,2,5,The customer service was of the highest standard - In a world of automated responses they are a breath of fresh air - a pleasure to deal with.
Lars Fors,2,5,I use Bitdefender Antivirus Plus since 2013.Easy to install and work with. When I had some problems I got very good and fast support.I have also tried other programs but not found any better than Bitdefender.My first -2013- included licence for 3 pcs so I gave 2 to my best friends.Bitdefender is best value for money.Lars
Nikolaj Skaarup-Rex,4,5,Had problems with removing files from a competitive anti-virus program but BitDefenders service and engineer team solved the problem in a brilliant way.
Sebastian Hakkarainen,1,5,when i first buyed bitdefnder my computer speed whent up alot and it keep my computer safe from the most virus and malware i even tryed make some that aother antivirus wont protect me from and it keep my computer fast and smode i higly recommend to try this out :D
Rizki Kurniawan,1,4,BitDefender really good and affordable antivirus which protects your computer perfectly. Autopilot mode automatically protect your computer without any effort.
Sumedha Manabarana,1,5,"Hi,I've been using different types of security software for almost 15 years, both paid and free versions. Among them, I honestly feel that Bitdefender tops the list with regards to its impact on the machine, overall protection,  reliability of the software, and customer friendly after sales service.For example, I encountered an instillation and registration problem from my side. I contacted Bitdefender online chat help and s/he (named Cosmin C) helped me giving all the necessary instructions, links and guidance from the basics to a bit more advanced, taking 54 minutes and 04 seconds.    S/he was very helpful and patient throughout the process and answered all of my questions. Eventually I was able to settle the issue successfully. This is excellent valued added service of Bitdefender.Other good software is there, but in my close observation, I've found that Bitdefender is incomparable. It's silent, requires minimal user involvement, highly reliable. It also provides limitless live support well in advance before something actually goes wrong.      Thank you for reading.Best regards,Sumedha"
Michael,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for a few years now. I tried other ones which i thought i was happy with but bitdefender offers so much than the past antivirus programs I was using . I had a few small issues installing the new version in which I contacted customer service and they helped and i was up and running in no time.
Evan Totten,1,5,"It is very difficult understanding the Romanian representative whose English was heavily accented.  That said, he was very courteous, polite, and clearly understood my problem getting my product registered.  Without his help I would only have had a trial period 30-day to use my new software which was purchased to have a 365-day license for 3 computers.  Before contacting the representative I had followed the on-line instructions precisely, but did not obtain the proper registration."
Venkataramanan Ragothaman,1,5,My product key was restricted in my region. Then I wrote to bitdefender about the problem. They replied within a reasonable time and my issue has been resolved at the earliest. Looking forward to using Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2015
ghalem,5,5,"I use Bitdefender for 2 years and during two my computer system and very on, I have 6 PC on bitdefender, I strongly recommend him(it), very discreet, he(it) takes care putting has days of the whole system and we can verify the rest of the post(post office) have distance."
David Hamilton,1,5,"I tried Bit Defender before purchasing it and found that this robust solution eliminated computer infections when my current antivirus failed me.  That sold me on this product.  I have been using Antivirus for over 20 years and find that Bit Defender is the easiest solution I have ever used.  It silently protects me yet will provide as much or little information as I want to make sure that it is working hard to defend all of my computers. Also, if I do have a problem, the courteous support staff at Bit Defender are always eager to help me fix their product so I can get back to work."
Heather Moore,14,5,"I've had this antivirus installed for about 3 years and wouldn't use any other. When there is a problem, which is very rare they are very prompt at coming up with a solution."
linda anstey,1,5,Thanks to the Bitdefender support team for guiding me through the installation of the Bitdefender Internet Security.
Bob Sperry,1,5,"I have used several virus protection programs over the years, and Bitdefender is by far the best.  They are prompt in their responenses and accurate in their suggested solutions.  I have never had to contact them 2 or 3 times, and still get incorrect information.  There is no ""Click on this and you will see that.""  With previous protection programs, that was a common suggested solution.. And i never seen ""that."""
Yolanda Mendiveles,1,4,"I needed help with uninstalling an old Bidefender program I had and they helped me uninstall the old and put in the new Bitdefender. No problems, they made it easy."
Lisa Lilly,1,5,"I have been very happy with their anti-virus product. I have never had any problems and anytime I have questions, they are there 24/7 with fast, competent and friendly help. This anti-virus has caught stuff the others would have missed completely and they are resolved immediately. I don't have to do anything. The program runs itself and notifies me only when there is something I need to know about. I have complete confidence that I am protected at all times.  I have tried several other so-called anti-virus products and so far, Bitdefender has been the best.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a reliable and easy to use anti-virus program for their computer."
Billy Wilson,1,5,"Answered my question , and provided the answer I Needed to resolve my issue in record time ,  Fantastic support   Thank You"
Piet Berrevoets,1,5,"I am very satisfied with the way you people responded to my problem. I experienced last year too how quick and correct your people respond and act and come with a solution that works. For this big problem I had now, all warnings were in red, you produced a solution within 2 days and gave me a link to get rid of the version a had a problem with and gave me a complete new version of the software. To carry out your instructions was very easy even for me ( I am not a real computerfreak)  .. Also how the system works and how complete it is, is very good.  Chapeau for your team."
DK Chaturvedi,1,5,"I have been using Bit Def. Total, for almost 4 years continuously........No other Anti virus come close to it. I strongly feel the PC is now in safe hand. I last four years, I have never noticed that my PC is attacked by any virus........BD fought so silently that I could hardly notice.......Customer service is so Great .........Like 7 Star.........Thank you BD.......DK Chaturvedi New Delhi NCR India"
Daniel,2,5,I've only had Bitedefender a few days now but this software is brilliant. I used AVG in the past and AVG destroyed my PC's Performance. With Bitedefender i've seen no hard hits on my PC. What I truely love is Bitedefenders auto pilot mode where it does everything for you. I am a gamer and Bitedefender knows when I am about to game and will optimize my system to give me the best gaming experience possible. It's great! The customer support are amazing also. Special thanks to them again for helping me out with some problems I had with my key. There is a reason why this software holds the number 1 spot for PC protection and performance. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you to the team at Bitedefender!
Syafizi Sazali,1,5,"I've been using a lot of security systems since the 90's. Starting from (not in order though) Trend Micro PC Cillin, Symantec Norton, McAfee, Avira, Kaspersky, Avast, AVG and even Panda.But nothing comes close to Bitdefender!Bought my 1st license in early 2013, now on a fresh new license to run into 2017 and would definitely continue subscribing it till the end of time for its reliability, second-to-none, top notch performance and not to forget the ever helpful Support Team too!I would highly recommend it to anyone from the most newbies to the most advanced PC users anywhere!"
Aj Peake,3,5,"Used BitDefender few years now and satisfied w/various means of computer protection.  Service (reps) & price #1.  Also appreciate popups that advise not to access url that is suspicious.  Btw, get Total Security 2015 or the newest version on it when updated."
Tom Pegler,1,5,"Not only does Bitdefender offer a wonderful product for a very reasonable price, it also has the most helpful, polite and capable customer support services I have experienced. They are always friendly and welcoming and happy to help. I found myself having paid for two subscriptions accidentally after upgrading to a newer version and after quickly rectifying this by removing the older version entirely they offered to give me 4 years free service on top of my new upgrade. Again, truly exceptional service and the best product I have found."
Eadie Wiggins,2,5,They're product is excellent and I recommend them. I have only had one minor problem which was solved easily and fast. The Support Centre were very polite and helpful.Great product. Works well. Will be staying with them.
Phil Hanley,8,5,The best anti virus available
Robert J. Montgomery,1,5,"I've tried a lot of products....and now I stick with Bitdefender.....Customer service is great....and the product is quick to pick up on potential threats.....where others have failed me.....definitely worth the investment....as I have had several computers ""Retired"" in perfect condition for upgraded technology, versus, I need a new computer because I just got a serious virus......Buy with confidence....."
Joan Conley,1,5,"We renewed our services with Bitdefender as we have been so satisfied. I chose to  do the 'process' on my own, but am not the most computer savy. I purchased, downloaded, and ran it, but at no time could I enter the 'activation' code.  I emailed the support team.  At first I got some generic feedback, then they asked me to send screenshots.  Since I still didn't understand, they emailed me a 3rd time, quickly mind you, on exactly what to do and easy way to understand.  I got it.  It's done.  No problem.  Thanks Bitdefender!"
George Trialonis,1,5,"I had tried a few antivirus and internet protection software in the past. Bitdefender tops them all. It is very trustworthy, effective and offers excellent technical support."
Sebastian Cord,1,5,"Bitdefender is the only virus suite that I trust. I've used them all from free to Symantec and Bitdefender is the only one that actually does what it claims. It is light, fast and worth every penny!"
Robert R Allison,2,4,"I've no problem with Bitdefender instructions for upgrading and/or fixing PC problems. However Bitdefender is a complex program and a hard copy operating manual would be welcome. Further, when I don't respond immediately to Bitdefender fix-it instructions, I get a canned message that implies that I'm not being responsive. Also, multiple emails for upgrades are not welcome."
Raivo,1,5,Deffently the best antivirus program ever!Customor support is very good and they knowig what they are doing!Maybe more languages needed (ex. estonia)
Mike,4,4,I had requested a review of my days remaining on my Total Security sub.This took several days and happened without me receiving a final notification.This resulted in a poor rating that I have since rescinded.Emailing me about the change would have helped....otherwise all good now.
Bob Hilton,1,4,It took a while to get an answer but it came in time and solved the problem.
Hans Revsbæk,4,5,Ordered Antivirus 2015 from a reseller who delivered an invalid activation code. The reseller was not able to solve the problem. Bitdefender solved the problem less than 24 hours after contact to Bitdefender support.
Iwan Zolobanuik,1,5,Happy Happy :]
Zannie Griffin,3,5,"I had a problem with my activation keycode provided by another supplier. After providing my proof of purchase, the problem was immediately corrected and activation of my product was completed. Very efficient customer care services. Thank you."
Thomas Richards,1,4,"Very good, as I said very professional. 👍👍"
Robert,1,5,I have BitDefender Internet Security 2013. BitDefender support explain that in order to remove the detected malware/virus they intentionally cause  'About Blank.' From what I read on the web this malware/virus can be in multiple locations to recreate itself with many different names causing it to take over the browser homepage over and over again. Once I felt all the bad files were quarantined by the Bitdefender product they sent me a link to a download to remove the 'About Blank' and put in my original browser homepage. All is working fine again. They earned  my 5 star rating.
Gerry Conway,1,5,I purchased Family Pack 2015 for 1 year and  installed it on a desktop. Using the link provided by Bitdefender I proceeded to install it on my laptop. I ended up with BD Total Security good for only 30 days. The problem was likely me selecting the wrong radio button but I didn't find the options and explanations clear on the provided link.Your tech Irena was great. She was patient and very helpful.  I was however surprised to be asked for my credit card info. I would not provide it and Irena was able to send me instructions on how to fix the problem without the card info. The problem is now fixed and I was very satisfied with your tech support.So far I'm impressed with the speed and unobtrusiveness of BDFP2015. and I'm grateful not to have to confirm that every bit of software I have and every time they need updates is OK. I had used Dr. Web for 3 years and found it good but frustrating in that respect.I also find BDFP2015 is what I need for a 4 person with 8 computers and 4 smartphones. Great value for the cost.
Geoff Warnock,4,5,"I've been using BitDefender for about 5-years now. During that time, I've moved from a single license to purchasing two 3-PC protection packages for me and my family / children's computers. Ease of installation, extremely fast background operation and coverage and immediate notification of any issues that arise. If I have a question, I ask the BitDefender Tech Support team and usually hear back from them the same day with comprehensive, complete support AND they follow-up with me to see if they met my needs. It's a rare company in the IT business that has this level of customer service. I'll be with them for as long as they continue with a great product and even better technical support"
Paul Horrocks,1,5,"I had a problem with my license key.  I called Bitdefender and I was immediately connected with a representative, no waiting time.  He quickly understood the problem, and said I would be e-mailed a new license key.  This came a day later and the problem was resolved without hassles.  I would definitely recommend Bitdefender to anyone."
John Marini,1,5,"After trying many different Anti Virus programs, i have come back full circle to Bitdefender AV. I have it on 3 of my laptops at home and it runs smooth with no affect on any of my systems.I would recommend at the least to install the Bitdefender Anti Virus Plus 2015Customer Service was fast, friendly and supportive"
Steve,1,5,Had issues upgrading a product on a new laptop. Tech support replied asap with  simple step by step guidance that solved my problem quickly & perfectly. Could not have had a better experience.
Mike Frewer,1,5,"Bitdefender cleaned up my system quickly and operates seamlessly with my daily routine. It doesn't slow my computer down like some other virus programs I have used. It's in the background, where it belongs....slaving away to help me and never asking me to change my style. Love it. Just like a good hunting dog...loyal and hard working.Regards: Mike"
Lyn M,4,5,This seems to be a most trustworthy program with ever-ready support behind you if for some unknown reason the program developes a fault.Viruses and malware don't seem to get a leg in with Bitdefender running
DennisK,1,5,"Fast and easy install ...Works fast and more thorough than others I have used,(Norton,avast,windows defender etc).Very very low impact on speed if any that I have noticed except for boot time...Cleans all cache on all browsers with one click...So much more than just an internet security or antivirus program....Love It!"
Les Rogers,1,5,"This is the first security ive ever bought,and it feels great.I get reports on events automatically,just put it auto pilot set you settings and surf knowing that you are protected,no worries."
Norman Hancock,1,5,"No problem with the installation, but when attempting to register I was told  the supplied code wasn't valid for the country I was in. However the Bitdefender staff responded promptly to successfully resolve the problem."
Timothy Porter,10,5,"I have used many big name, top dollar antivirus products, and still my computer developed severe infections and died horribly.  After reading the information at Bleepingcomputer.com, i learned about BitDefender.  Of course i was skeptical, after all, i'd been screwed by the best of them.  the antivirus developed by the guy who killed his neighbor, the one named after that guy on the honeymooners, or the one whose initials means ""average"", were all just completely useless.  After rescuing my computer for what would be the last time, i tried BitDefender.  And then i bought it.  And then i bought enough licenses for all of my machines.  And i have never had to rescue my computer since.  On the few occasions when i have needed their support, i got answers via email withing 24 hours.  Now, i'm pretty good at describing problems in ways that tech-heads can give me good answers the first time around, but BitDefender support staff are so intuitive, and have obviously seen a lot of disease-ravaged machines in their careers, that they really give outstanding, detailed, step-by-step advice that works the first time and every time.  you don't have to take my word for it.  download the free version of their total internet protection and toss your antivirus to the curb for a month.  visit some high-risk sites, like viooz.co, or some of those scary russian movie sites that promise the latest movies streaming for free.  If it's safe to watch, you'll get to see a free movie.  if it's not, BitDefender will tell you, without fail.  if it warns you, heed the warning and get out of there.  And BitDefender often has great promotions on their products.  i got a year of protection for 5 devices for 30 bucks.  Try that with the murderer's antivirus!"
Dale R. Ackerman,1,4,"The product is good, but trying to communicate is so hard because everyone is speaking mostly broken English.  Then you folks sent  me an e mail that there was a situation that had to be taken care of and I do not know what that was.It started with a number 20 something"
H2T,1,5,"Delighted with Bit Defender Total Security 2015 performance, tools and excellent costumer support."
Brad,4,5,So far this has been a very pleasant experience
Nicholas Flint,1,4,A little problem became confusing when 2 companys answer each in there own way.Avangate not understandable.Thanks to Bitdefender for your solution.Nicholas Flint
Sharon Jensen,2,5,This is the second time I have had an issue resolved quickly and efficiently by Bitedefender.  I am really impressed with their service.  I would highly recommend Bitedefender.
Debra Knight Malaney,3,5,"Personalized service is almost unheard of these days, but Bitdefender Tech Support renewed my faith; specifically Narcisa Cocei and Mihai Ionita. For some reason, I could only connect to the internet by turning off my firewall and was promptly inundated with pervasive adware that attempted to trick me into numerous downloads and so much adware that I could barely uncover the true content of website pages. Your Tech reps sent me detailed directions for solving both issues. I could not have solved this on my own. What a relief! Your product is well worth the small annual fee and I will be sure to mention Bitdefender to my colleagues. Sincerely, Debra Malaney"
Stephen,1,5,"I had a problem with my bank site being blocked by BitDefender an easy fix.  Most important was hold time less than 10 seconds amazing.Figuring out which product to buy is a different matter.  I wanted a business solution, but there was inadequate  documentation to make a decision, so bought home solution.  Home solution is extremely fast and doesn't slow down my computer like other security software has in the past."
Foppe de Jong,1,5,"Because off being hackt, We had a real problem, after writing to Bitdefenderthey answered in very short time with a perfect solution for my  problem.We give them 10 out of 10.Best regardsFrosty Ice Mining"
christopher Mahony,3,5,"Re Ticket No 2014050110370001.To Edis Sejfula and Cosmin Grigore and the Bitdefender team, my sincere thanks for solving the issues concerned. The follow up was first class, I must admit, it was I who was lax in following through on the recommended solutions. But the Bitdefender team pursued it to a final and successful conclusion.Many thanks and kindest regards.Christopher Mahony"
Robert,2,5,Have used Bitdefender for over 3 years now. 1st year with their free product and last two years with their paid for product. I'm very happy with the standard of protection and performance from both the free and the paid versions. I've also found their support team to be excellent. Fast response times and speedy resolutions. overall very very happy.
Wylker Pereira,2,5,"Great AV. Help me a lot.I've 5 Computers at home and all they have a 3 years licence.If you want a simple to use, safe and cheap Anti Virus, buy Bitdefender."
Bryan Uhl,1,5,"I have had most of the Anti virus packages out there. For ease of use, security and support there is no better choice than Bitdefender."
Irene,18,1,"Hate their safe-pay, it doesn't work all the time. Hate the pop-ups. Hate their ""Secure Mode"". It slows the system. I have Norton now, and I can't feel it's there - I hardly notice it. My PC has never been so fast!!!One isn't able to cancel the auto-renewal on their own site. You have to create an account at Avangate, and manually cancel it yourself. Too much trouble. So goodbye."
Nolan Colvert,1,5,I bought Bitdefender  year ago and was very happy with their service and if I had a question about something and emailed them about it in no time I had a reply back from them. I am pleased with Bitdefinder and I have even renewed my service with them for another year now. I would and have told my friends about Bitdefinder  and I recommend it to every one to try it. Thank you Bitdefender your the bestNolan Colvert
Matt,11,5,"Bitdefender far surpasses my previous system ( Norton)as it is faster, and I feel more secure with using it when dealing with financial matters. I have been using it for 2 years now and it has always kept my computer secure.The Support Team have been superb, one problem I had was dealt with by them within 3 days,  it was caused by Norton NOT removing everything when I removed the programme.The other great thing is that when they develop a new product you are able to update to that on your current active licence.Bitdefender has won a number of awards and I can see why, this is one product that I will stay with while they are this good and and wel priced."
mark kughes,1,5,Bitdefender - it really is the best protection for my computer.
Paul Seamans,1,5,Great support services ! They've always been there whenever I've had a problem and have fixed it fast. Always friendly and courteous and professional !
Don Kannon,2,5,Bitdefender is a very good product withexcellent customer service.
JoeDGeorge,2,5,The password I was using simply stopped working and the Bitdefender Team was able to solve the problem and now I have a new password and all is well.Great job.Joe
David T Wright,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for more than 5 years and would highly recommend this Antivirus company.During that time I have never had a problem that was not quickly solved by their outstanding help team.The product runs seamlessly in the background and has so many facets to its usefulness that the product is sure to satisfy even the most discerning user
George W Caso,1,5,"I asked, you responded.  What else could I expect?"
Simon Marks,9,5,"I've used Bitdefender products in the past, including my latest piece of software Total Security 2015. It works fine, in the background & is unobtrusive during my computers use. If I have ever needed to contact support they have always responded in a timely fashion until my query was sorted out."
SceneShifts,4,5,"I have used Internet Security on my PCs for years and have never had a virus or attack problem.  The resources used by BD are imperceptible to me. I recently contacted BD about a number of Android phones and tablets I have and the customer service changed my subscription to Multiple Devices Home so that I now have Total Security on my PCs and Mobile security on my phones and tablets. Upgrading the PCs and installing the Android devices was a breeze. Rather than charge me for the upgrade, BD subtracted about 10% of my remaining subscription days.  This was all done with courtesy and efficiency ... other companies would certainly benefit by looking at the support that BD offers."
tobie.botha,2,5,I find the persons at the help desk extremely kind and helpful and pleasure to deal with. Very professional
Katarina Wikström Dagerskog,2,5,"I changed to bit defender a 6 months ago , being very disappointed with my other antivirus program and I must say it is excellent. Easy to handle and a very quick and friendly response from their support center. So far any isse has been solved immediatelyFive stars!I can strongly recommend this product to everyoneKatarina"
chris,7,5,"I am not very computer literate, I have relied on Bitdefender for my security/protection for three years now and never had any issues. Having needed to change my computer I had a problem loading the software with my old licence key, the problem was entirely my own and Bitdefender exchanged four prompt, courteous emails in a jargon free form that I was able to understand pasting a link for me to use when I did not know how to send them a report from my desk top. They could not have been more obliging."
Ivelina Stoilova,1,5,"Bitdefender Total Security is, by my opinion, the best anti virus and firewall software. I have used it for 3 years and I'm perfectly satisfied with its services. It's not hardly to work with, has a very accurate support and the most important - keeps my PC's safe."
MvP,1,5,Easy installing. No nerdy uncomprehensible terms. Everything in one bundle. Great extra features! Took the 3 PC - 3 Yrs for the 3rd time. Good and swift helpdesk. I had to use them for a problem that involved some specialized software on my PC.
PT,17,4,"I am not especially knowledgeable as a computer user, and not at all knowledgeable in more abstruse technical aspects.  That said, Bitdefender Internet Security seems to work in a stable and reliable manner.  I have once, in a year, had to seek support on a niggling problem that didn't affect security;  the matter was dealt with promptly and effectively.My only reservation is that while the program does not most of the time slow my computer noticeably, when engaging in one of its automatic updates it sequesters almost the entire resources of my computer - not a serious problem for me, although a business user might find it an irritation.  This could, of course, be a problem with my machine rather than with Bitdefender."
Adam Govier,2,5,"Have been with Bitdefender for 3 years and very satisfied with the quality of the product.  I have requested support on 2 occasions and been very impressed with the way my issues were dealt with quickly, professionally and courteously."
Todd Hawkins,1,5,"The product is excellent, and have used Bitdefender for several years now on the initial recommendation of colleagues.The 2015 Upgrade presented some initial difficulty for my system, but the patient support of the Bitdefender support team eased my concerns and eventually resolved the issues.  Of note, the issues were not with Bitdefender, but some of the settings I had already on my system.  On adjustment, everything works better than ever with no lag and all continues to be safe, secure, and functioning well."
William Hawkins,1,5,"I recently had to call BitDefender Tech Support for help with my multi-computer subscription.  I was having problems registering the product and my wife's computer was experiencing serious issues without an active BitDefender program.  The Tech Support person who took my call was extremely patient, competent, and thorough.  I was very pleased with the level of service and good humor this guy displayed throughout the whole process.  I only regret that I cannot remember the person's name!  After this experience, I feel very comfortable recommending this product to anyone who may need a first rate anti-virus software program that is backed up by really great folks in Tech Support."
Martin Price,13,5,"Opened computer 1 day (don't think I did anything different on preceding day) and couldn't log on to Hotmail or Microsoft account using IE, Firefox or Chrome.  Tried Microsoft and despite efforts, could not help. Tried Bitdefender and they fist checked firewall (no difference) then SSL scan (?) which when turned off allowed me to access Hotmail.  Was advised to update for free to Total Security 2015 which solved issue.  Support staff on chat line were very proficient and knowledgeable. Would recommend !!"
Maurice Paul Laviolette,1,5,"Over 5 years of excellence in dependability & reliability! Not a single virus has got past Bitdefender's defenses since I've installed this program on my computers in 2009! Great online offers and pricing with the option to have one, two , or three year protection plans at better than in store pricing. In my opinion, if your looking for better than average virus protection, that has minimal too no significant impact on your operating system, then I highly recommend Bitdefender over other virus protection products."
william,1,5,I have used Norton before and I lost two computers because of them and I was having trouble with them again . a friend told me about bitdefender and I tried the free one first and then I bought a two year subscription.
Leslie Needham,2,5,"I have tried a few internet security suites in the past including,Norton,Webroot,Kaspersky. There is still only one for me and that is Bitdefender Total Security. For ease of use and all the little extras it includes I would recommend it to anyone. I love the Secure Wallet for storing passwords and other sensitive material. I find the price is excellent value and I will certainly be renewing my subscription next year.Well done to all the Bitdefender team and long may you reign. Thank you."
Maurice de Wert,13,5,"Since a few month I have now Bitdefender, I am very satisfied with the program. Just bought a Macbook instead of a windows laptop, and the where very helpful to change my license into a PC and Mac license."
Kelly Illian,1,5,"Impressive product, easy installation, great customer service!"
Jay Plowright,1,5,"Ipurchased the Total Security Product during the ""All for one"" promotion. I had to have it removed due to very slow computer, especially with opening Windows 7 and any downloads more than 5 or 6 megabites. I also had many frozen screens, some when I was working online. I can't afford these freezes as my company does not pay me for problems with my computer. When I call your support team, they are all very good customer service foks and speak profesionally and are very considerate of m67y time and issues."
Tony Noahs,4,5,Bitdefender total security in my mind is totally unequalled in every way.I would never have anything else now!
Ian Forshaw,1,5,"I've used Bitdefender on various operating systems throughout the years and it has always served me well. OK, we've fallen out on occasion but a quick email to the help team son sorted me out.I now use Bitdefender on my Win 8.1 PC and my Xperia Z2 smartphone and I am more than satisfied. I know that it's working away in the background keeping me safe. Bitdefender gives me peace of mind and that's worth a lot to me. I'll stick with the winner."
Vatsal Patel,1,4,"Bitdefender is good and effective antivirus. Its customer support is also one of the most friendly and effective to solve your problem. However it has too much influence on performance of your pc, especially new version. I suggest to review whole bitdefender before using it as it may influence your pc in negative way as it may delete you recycle bin if you command to optimize your pc without reviewing its options. However some new upgrades like automatic switching pc performance as per your activity like gaming, work, movie is appreciable. It is also one of the fastest antivirus to scan your devices and give accurate report. Autopilot function is also nice as you just need to switch it on and forget about maintenance of your pc. It requires minimum attention from user about performance. Overall nice and effective product for virus removal and safe browsing, especially new edition."
irenco,2,5,I do recommend Bitdefender because I had some problems with another paid anti-virus program. I could not remove it and I contacted Bitdefenders Service Department.They were very helpful and reacted fast to my questions.
Ali N,1,5,"For me the story of BitDefender starts couple of years ago, when many of my friends suggested it to me, Like always I reject their comments and told them, come on BitDefender is not that good.(that time BitDefender was still a new company)Until one day me and some of other friends give 5 different top antivirus software a try by installing each of them in separate computers.All those computers that we tried were similar in terms of having same software and we knew that they all having lots of viruses.The result was amazing, BitDefender was able to:(in compare to other top 5 softwares)1. Detect more number of virus, spyware, trojan 2. Able to eliminate all of them (more than other softwares)At that time the detection and mitigation rate for other software differs,Let's say:Software A Could detect 800 infectionsWas able to defect 7955 infected files could not be eliminated for different reasonsSoftware B Could detect 850 infections (more than A)Was able to defect 750 (less than A)and so onSince then BitDefender is still the best"
Georgi Nedelchev,2,5,The best product and service. Great packs - perfect solution.
Duane,1,5,I recently renewed my subscription to Bitdefender and ran into a firewall snag with my printer/scanner.  It ONLY took one phone call that was answered by a LIVE representative (Gabriel) to solve the issue.  In total I invested approximately two minutes and my issue was corrected.  Thank you!
Mariusz,3,5,"I have been using Bit Defender for a year now and am very satisfied, recently I had to contact customer support with help regarding the upgrade to 2015 and it was simply nothing but a great experience.It's been a couple of years since I started using bitdefender and I can honestly say that I am completely satisfied and I recommend it to all my friends and family."
Sheeko,1,5,I started using Bitdefender total security for my PC security after a lot of product research and I have no hesitation to recommend it to my family and friends for its product quality and support from Bitdefender.Bitdefender keeps my machine virus and malware free and the system scans are very through. On a few occasions that I have had to contact Bitdefender support I found them to be very well trained and professional.
Steve,1,5,"I've used bit defender since 2009. Set up is easy and it works in the background with no problem. Also has easy controls if you're a hands on person. I've recommended this to all my friends and coworkers as well as my kids. Superior to macafee, AVG, and Norton."
David Edwards,2,5,"Sent In My problem to the team and they checked my Computer and replied next day when I switched on my computer, asking for more info but I had resolved the issue."
Ron Francoeur,1,5,Product has performed very fast and seamless - love the autopilot feature. Recent problems resulted in a service request being made. Very quick email response from support team. Easy to use tools to capture data and provide support team what they needed to effect a timely correction and upgrade of the product. Best Antivirus I have ever used.
Terry Marks,1,5,"Bitdefender IMO is a better product than most, I was using Norton and after I opened a file that Norton said was ok to open, it had a very bad malware in it.  It took me a few days to get rid of it all.  My son who uses BD is the one who told me about BD so, I downloaded a trial used it for about two months and was very pleased with it so I bought it.  So far BD has protected me very well but, there is always room for improvement.  What I look for in the best anti-virus software is resource usage - must use little, speed scanning of everything, getting all of the viruses and malware not just the easy ones and able to keep PC running in top shape.  So far BD has showed me some of that.  Thanks!"
raymundo c supena,1,5,i bought 2 units and i am planning to install the other one to my pc at the office.
Graham Jones,15,5,"After years with another well-known Internet security software provider I switched recently to Bitdefender. I am glad I did. The software is much easier to use and has far less impact on the running of my PC. I had a recent question which I needed answering, though. Their service was immediate, helpful and spot-on, answering my question precisely. None of the copy and paste lark you get from some other companies. I am very pleased I switched to Bitdefender, not only is it a great product but the company has excellent service too."
karen,1,4,"I couldn't get logged in to my free bitdefender antivirus, which had come highly recommended!  I was frustrated but kept my cool and the customer care did come through for me (when I thought I'd have to get another antivirus, as the trial period had ended).  I think the program is great, I think my problem might be because I have Vista!"
Roy Maine,1,5,"Not only does Bitdefender provide an excellent security product they also  offer an effective, timely support service."
Shelley Brunson,1,5,"This is the first anti-virus program I've ever run, that didn't mess up everything else in my computer.  It's very easy to use the program.. and I'm an amateur.  I had a LOT of questions that I sent to customer service at Bitdefender... and their staff did an EXCELLENT job at answering every one of them.  They were very patient, quick to respond, and made their answers completely clear. Even providing answers in a step by step fashion.  I'm using their 30 day free trial right now, because I didn't want to get stuck with another crappy program.  It's wonderful the way Bitdefender lets you try the product for 30 days before purchasing, to know what it does, and how it works!  I WILL be purchasing Bitdefender, and since I'm SO pleased with the product, and the customer service... I'm going to buy their best package.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone!  This company goes that extra mile to make sure you're happy, and able to use the product easily.  They are quick to respond, thorough... and able to be reached 24/7."
Fiona parker,6,5,"I am a total dummy when it comes to anything techie. The representatives I spoke to were very patient, and helpful in making me feel confident about the product I was buying, and I love the fact that they have phone numbers I can ring with real people on the end of the line, that actually answer the phone, in good time, and can resolve my issues. Brilliant.Fiona P. England."
Bostian-Slovenia,1,5,I am using Bitdefender protection since 2008 and even these days they are doing a great job helping users to use them PC's safe from any kind of malware or viruses. Program works in a background and user will not even noticed work of software protection speaking of using system resources. Everything works fine and I can suggest/recommend  Bitdefender security to all PC users if they notice system hangouts with other security software.
Eddie Gair,1,5,"I had an issue that I couldn't solve on my own so I contacted the help centre at Bitdefender, I was pleasantly surprised to receive the guidance I required to resolve my problem within a couple of days, excellent service & I cant rate these guys highly enough on their performance & response."
"Bas, The Netherlands",7,5,"Bitdefender total security is excellent in my opinion. After a short while it does just what it needs to do: secure my windows 8 computer. It does most things silently, so without asking questions. In a former version of Bitdefender I was quite some times annoyed. They learned from that.It has antivirus, firewall, and things like system optimization removing rubbish on my computer in no time. And the good thing is also that I have 1 year of the program for 30 dollars, for 3 computers. That is much less than I would pay if I am a first customer. Just before my 2013 version would be ended, they sent me an email with that nice offer, and i made use of it (hope they do that in the future again). Great program and excellent support by email."
Basharath Sharieff,1,5,"I've been using bit-defender since 4-5 months.. and apart from services provided, bit-defender is the best anti-virus of all... as no other antivirus company provide such facilities like pc optimizer, disk de-fragmentation, pc clean up, registry cleanup and many more options. it reduces half of the work when we sit down to solve the issue like disk clean up..... best anti-virus I've ever had!"
Loraine Lord-Morgan,1,5,"My PC was churning, creating hundreds of thousands of Temp files and folders, not letting me download files using IE, and basically running so slow it was unusable.  I downloaded Bitdefender Internet Security 2015 to replace my old AV.   It seemed to help somewhat, but a Bitdefender popup reading ""Disinfection in progress"" stayed on the screen constantly.  I wrote to Bitdefender Support about it.  They requested that I perform a scan of the system, and sent instructions on how to do it.  I sent them the results of the scan, and after a few days they sent me a tool to remove the infection (the Poweliks Trojan).  It worked like a charm.  The popup is gone, the problems went away, and the PC is fast again.Excellent customer service!M Morgan"
Peter Hart,2,5,"We experienced a few problems when upgrading from Bitdefender Total Security 2013 to the 2015 version. Our questions were answered quickly and the tips to enhance computer performance were excellent. Communications with Alexandru Leahu, BD Sr Tech Support Engineer restored our faith in using tech support services when required and we recommend both the product and the people as a result. Thank you."
Anatoli Lioultchenko,1,4,"Bitdefender can do more and something better to protect the PC from problems and a user from additional hedache then other similar Tools. Study,try,analyse,compare and make decision to enjoy."
Ray,10,5,I use Bitdefender on all 6 PC's on my network and also on 2 laptops and the support is always first class.
Peter Alberts,1,5,"i have had bitdefender for four years now and i can honestly say i think it is the best security software i have ever used. before bitdefender , i tried all the major players-norton, mcafee, avg, etc. the only one i ever renewed was bitdefender. as someone who is not tech savvy , i can say it is the easiest and best of all of them. just load it and set it and you never have to worry about anything. it has kept me out of trouble for four years and it is the only security software i will run on my computers. the customer service has been top-notch and they have always helped me whenever i needed it. no run-arounds , just  the correct information i needed to keep going. i highly recommend them to anybody who needs  superior protection on their computers. for me , they have proven they are the best year after year."
Emre,1,5,2015 interface with Autopilat and Optimize option be stronger and beautiful.(Turkish language installer except lack of)
Karl Byriel,3,5,Bitdefender is the best anti-virus product I have used in over twenty years as an IT user and professional.
Aaron Fisher,1,5,"I was having a problem clearing a virus/malware, so i sent in a ticket along with a scan log.The rep directed  me to a place that i kept overlooking in my settings.In no time i was cleaned up and running .In all this issue from scan to resolve was under an hour and on a weekend evening to boot!Great service and highly recommended software!"
Richard Sutton,9,5,"I was impressed with the way Bitdefender dealt with my support query, and the product appears to be a first class defence against internet nasties.  My frustrations with the unfamiliarity of the product at first were really my own impatience, and not a fault of the product.  Bitdefenders support sent an analysis of my PC to them which enabled them to pinpoint the problem as conflicts with other protection software, and they provided detailed advice to resolve the issue.  Excellent"
T.K.,1,4,"Nothing wrong with the product, easy to buy, install and configure - or just leave on autopilot, works fine for home use. Encryption feature in Total is not the best, but the rest of the apps work well enough. Customer service top notch, chat available 24/7 with good English skills and knowledge base.Bitdefender have resorted to intrusive advertising campaigns in the past, e.g. pop-ups on the desktop, but have not seen them after opting out (I never opted in though!). I'm with Bitdefender for the third year in a row and they protect me, my business and my family without interfering with our daily routines, said business or gaming, video services or messengers. Solid product, friendly company that seems to learn from their mistakes."
michael callaghan,2,5,"i recommend this product for its price, reliability and support."
Barbara L. Eastwood,1,5,"I needed help in downloading the version of Bitdefender that I purchased.  When I first downloaded it, I accidently downloaded the wrong version.  The representative stayed on the phone with me for an hour helping me to download the version I purchased correctly.  He was very professional and courteous."
belkin,1,5,Had an issue with a virus - the Bitdefender support team asked for my computer logs - they solved my issues the same day.  Great product and outstanding service.
Eduardo Prado,1,5,"I really recommend Bitdefender because the products are very good, reliable, the support center solved problem I had quickly. If you are looking for a company that trully respect costumers, I'm sure you'll be very satisfied with Bitdefender."
BSchulz123,4,5,"I am very impressed with my new BitDefender Total Security 2015 Family Pack.It runs on 7 PC's now, with Operating Systems from Windows XP, Win 7, Win 8.1 thru Win 10 Preview (build 9879).My first impressions are: very competent and easy to manage.Performs its job quietly in the background.Recommended!"
Paul Baker,1,5,When I had to reprogram my computer I found I had lost all my files and I had to start all over again. I turned to Bitdefender because I had just renewed. They helped me by giving me a new registration number . I now have it reinstalled. Thank you guys for helping an old man out of a tight spot.
Rockne White,1,5,Very good customer service! They solved my problem quickly and seemed very interested in what I had to say. The anti-virus program seems to work well. Just what I was looking for!
Dennis Ondo,1,5,buy it today. protect  your pc.
Father Lenny Nelson,2,5,"Most High-end Anti-Virus/Network Security applications work pretty well at preventing & eliminating threats. None are perfect. But it's what happens WHEN you have a Virus that sets these companies apart. I used Norton & Avast (Paid) for years but when I did get an infection & called for Help, I had to PAY to get rid of it.I recently got a BAD virus that affected my machine that NOTHING picked up. I emailed Bitdefender that I was in trouble. They wrote back in less then an hour with a request for Logs & told me how to get them.They uncovered the Virus & Two days later sent me an App specifically designed to eradicate THAT virus, and it worked perfectly. That followed up and kept be informed the entire time AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY for their help!!!!I will NEVER use any other Anti-virus/Security application. These guys treat your issues like it's their own and that is worth EVERYTHING."
Paul,1,5,"I upgraded from my 2013 total security to the 2015 total security.  After the updates, Bitdefender completely froze. My computer worked fine, but I was unable to manipulate Bitdefender - could not open it, unistall or delete the files. Bitdefender's customer support was able to help and now I am completely up and running.  Very pleased with the results"
Vladimir Angelov,1,5,I found the best antivirus software. And i really mean it. its name is - Bitdefender. And for sure - the best customer support. Well done !!!
Alex,1,5,"I have contacted Bitdefender's customer support multiple times to sort out renewal and licensing issues. They open the support ticket immediately and responds very quickly, most of the time the next day. They get right to the point and provides me with exact answers I need every time."
Darren Starr,1,5,"Most antivirus companies have really poor support, waiting days or weeks to get a response by email. I wasn't even a customer and yet found 24 hour support that was fast and efficient and answered my questions. Bitdefender was recommended to me by family, then I read great reviews online as I was becoming a little bothered with Kaspersky and it slowing down my system enormously.I will be buying 2X3 PC licences for 2 households. Way to go BitDefender!"
Tom Hines,1,5,"You folks seem to have your act together.  Your response to my problem was prompt, accurate, and easy.  The survey you sent was straight forward, simple, and short.Thank you;"
Cliff Garwood,11,5,"I use Bitdefender on both my partners and my pc,s, and I think it's excellent. I feel safe with all that I do online, and I know my bank details are safe too. Would recommend it to anyone. Definitely the best security program I h ever bought."
BLAAG,2,5,"I have tried a few of the other A-Vs(external references), none of them come close. Once I went to Bitdefender-I will never go back. I had heard in numerous forums how Bitdefender would slow down or cripple your system. I can tell you that is so far from the truth.It has never slowed my system down. It is lighter on resources than most of the others. Also, if you ever have any issues, there support team will respond back in a timely manner to help you. Why? Because they care about their customers. These folks are on top of things-constantly trying to stay ahead of the CyberThreats. Bitdefender is top-notch, hands down. AWAKE!!"
James Costine,3,5,"The best protection that i have used: Bitdefender 2014 proved to be an excellent choice,ran smoothly no noticeable effects of slowing down PC.I have just set up 2015, they gave 421 days by using left over days from 2014, can't say anything bad about Bitdefender, just to say keep your  firewall going till 2016 and i will be a very happy chappy.Yours Mr J A Costine"
Martin Schelble,1,4,"It took me an hour of following the download instructions and another two hours and two phone calls to customer service.  Joe solved my issue with the last call.  And it wasn't operator error.This problem happens every year I buy the product.  I've purchased the product for approx. six years now and every time I get more frustrated.I have to admit though, overall I'm very happy with the product!"
Miguel Angel,3,5,"I´ve been using BitDefender Total Security 2014 for one year at three computers. No incidents at all. Very secure, easy of use and don´t waste resources, I think it is really light about use of memory and computing resources. I´m completelly satisfied with it"
Michael Anderson,1,5,In these days of do-it-yourself troubleshooting it was amazing to see the responsiveness and support of teh bitdefender team.They worked with me over a series of emails and my busy travel schedule to make sure our Trovi issue was fixed. You don;t see support like this much today unfortunately.
ReverendAntonio Lobato,1,5,"Its seamless, not intrusive and requires minimal occasional attention. Perfect for any discerning individual or organisation seeking the best possible protection. :)"
Bernard,2,5,Bitdefender internet security has truly amazed me as it doesn't take a lot of  resources to run. Excellent choice for gamers.
Luc Smet,3,4,A few months ago I experienced a serious problem when using my browsers. Nor IE or Firefox would start up. The problem arised after an update of the Norton Internet Security suite. Four hours of communication and interventions with and by the helpdesk did not solve the problem. Suddenly all communication was stopped. I was hoping for an email or a telephone call but nothing came. My conclusion: they were not able to solve the problem. That was the moment I decided to go for another Internet Security suite. I chose for for Bitdefender because of its reputation. I hope I will not be disillusioned.
Martin,3,5,Bitdefender scans and clears my computer faster than any of the other five antivirus applications I have tried. It is also unobtrusive with update downloads taking a fraction of the time other do and without annoying pop-ups.
Robin,1,5,"I cannot recommend Bitdefender enough for your mobile device.  I am one to research my products before I make a purchase and last year my cell had been hacked and I lost some important photos due to my own mistake of never properly guarding it as I surfed the web.  I had researched where ""Bitdefender"" was beating out Norton's and MacAfee on different levels....in particular, what mattered most to me is that they really minimize all the unnecessary bells and whistles of a user interface in order to 'not' chew up your valuable battery time.  I bought a new smart phone for practically pennies on Black Friday last year and was amazed that for a small cost of $14.95 a year, ""Bitdefender"" gives me my own personal Army for my mobile device and it allows me the ease and comfort of knowing it is own my side, scanning for malware as I surf and checking my new app's,  as I ad them to my phone, by telling me what is safe, or what may be a danger.  I have spent the last year telling everyone I can to make the switch to ""Bitdefender.""  From safe surfing to Anti-theft, and the quickest, most professional customer service I have ever received from anyone (including from whom I bought my device!)....I cannot say enough about them.  After all....these days, who wouldn't want their own personal Army?"
Amanda Doran,1,5,"I wrote to Bitdefender after experiencing a problem with malware.  I was informed that the situation I encountered isn't dealt with by Bitdefender because this is a legitimate software which does not contain any malware traces. However, I was given a detailed account of how to solve the problem.  It worked like a dream and I thank them so much for that.  I call this 'over and above the call of duty' - thank you for supporting your customers so well.  I have been with Bitdefender for years now (having tried other companies before) and would highly recommend them to anyone - even Nana's!"
George Meingast,2,5,"Not much else to say... I reported an issue, was sent a message that it's being worked on... 2 days later the issue was fixed. Considering they are a global company with lots of clients, that's pretty impressive to me!!! :)"
Martin Schoenbachler,1,5,"I wrote earlier to resolve my problem of having paid for Bitdefender 2015 and being placed in a Trial Version. After forwarding an e-mail to Bitdefender about my problem, I received a prompt reply indicating that I failed to enter my ""registry"" or ""license"" number (r/l#) which caused my placement in a Trial Version mode. However, I cannot find an r/l# anywhere on my computer or in an e-mail. My present Trial Version expires in three days (Nov 20). On that date I will have two choices: 1)  Leave my computer exposed to viruses, etc., or 2) Pay again for Bitdefender 2015. As a 75 yr old, on a fixed-income, I'd prefer not to pay again for some error that I have made in downloading your product. Any assistance you can provide will be most appreciated. Regards, Marty"
Robert Thompson,1,4,"The techs all (that I have spoken with seem to have a very thorough knowledge of the technical aspect of computer operations, and they never leave an issue unresolved. (even if short-cuts) are needed to use along the way to the desired end."
Dr. Ruben Abraham Mathew,1,4,I am terrible with computers and their programmes. Had a problem with my Bitdefender. Asked friends - tried all methods - could not solve it. In desperation I wrote to bitdefender. Surprise of surprises !! I got an immediate response. Next came a email detailing what I should do.  Problem solved...really impressed.
Hansophos,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for over 5 years. I have turned a lot of friends and associates on to BD since then. I work for major IT company with 3 letters as initials. I work in technical support and have had a PC in my house for the last 32 years. I know what I am talking about. I neglected to update BD with the latest version and paid dearly for it. I have 3 PCs in my house that I use alone. My wife has her own and my daughter has 2. After six months without BD on my system found a virus and SPAM pop-ups. I cleaned up the registry as much as possible but I knew I needed to get BD. Ordered, got and FIXED in about 30 minutes. I will keep updated even if I don't eat. This also included contacting technical support. I do it for a living with IXX (leaving out he other initiials). The technical support guys at BD assisted with every question and were fast in their response. I had a small problem but when I contacted the company that I purchased BD from I got no response to this day. I contacted BD Technical Support and got a response in a few hours. I have to give it to the product and technical support. BEST!"
Julie Rector,1,5,"Bitdefender provides the best protection for all our pc's.  It has never failed where Norton, McAfee  and AVG have.  Customer service is exceptional."
Arca David,2,5,They're very good.
Kirsty Erikson,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender since I got my new computer. They were able to help me set up the system; and any problems I had were quickly resolved--I'm NOT the most computer savvy person, but they were kind, efficient, and fast at setting me up. The system runs without needing my help, which is a great thing when you're not a ""computer person""..! The older version stopped a bunch of virus attacks, and the new upgraded version checks links before I even click on them, so I can see at a glance that they're safe. It's really and optimized experience. And the value can't be beat! I read and compared 4 different services before choosing Bitdefender, and I couldn't be happier.Kirsty E."
Trev Eden,12,5,Experienced an ongoing issue with Bitdefender periodically advising my internet connection was secure. The support team identified the problem and were able to send instructions as to how to change my Home network to secure.
C. David,2,5,I had a two year license with more than half the time left to expiry when I received a message re a new product for 2015. Upon inquiring I was told that I was eligible for a free upgrade along with instructions on how to do so. The uninstall/install procedure was smooth and easy.
DiaborMagics,3,4,"I have been using Bitdefender for about a year now, maybe a little more. I started with 2013, but could freely upgrade to 2015, which is a big plus. Especially in 2013 I sometimes had the problem that for a few months my Wallet didn't work. I love the Wallet, so it was very inconvenient for me and the customer Service couldn't really help me. They tried their best, though, replied quickly and the rest of the software worked great.Now I have 2015, the only problems with the wallet are caused by the Google Chrome extension (and most likely the account-sharing) system. The software still works great, although I have a little more of a problem navigating through the menu; I was used to the way it was in the past and the features I often check are now a little more hidden, they require an extra menu to go through.Still all in all a great program, it makes me feel safe, the support is great although they cannot help with every issues, but that's the world of computers. I'll definately keep using it and can recommend it to anyone!"
Paul Diaz-Berrio,3,5,"Bitdefender features many useful tools. Its antivirus program is top notch and its extra system accessories are very thorough, simple and communicate both problems and feedback very clearly. The monitoring system of Bitdefender is efficient and never lets anything bypass its security. I am proud to use it."
Graeme Floody,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for several years now and have had no difficulties at all and on the odd occasion where I just required information the person on the phone knew exactly what I required and assisted very quickly.  Over the years I used several types of antivirus program and none came close to being as user friendly or as thorough as Bitdefender. Ten out of ten from me.Gra
Joni Fitzgerald,2,5,"I ran into a problem with trying to open a job search website through Google Chrome and couldn't figure out why or who to contact to ask.  So I emailed Bitdefender with the issue.  They confirmed my email right away and by the next morning had emailed me back with several options, all very thorough and easy to understand.  The first one work!!!  They also checked back with me to ensure my problem was solved.  Very awesome customer service and the product itself is great!!!  A definite must have over Norton, McAfee..."
Steve,9,5,Had a problem when Bitdefender dropped of my computer. Contacted the help desk who very promptly advised the fix and also informed mehow I could get the updated version. Very impressed with service. Thank you
Brad Rooksby,1,1,"Regarding the quality of the software, I honestly can't say anything negative or positive. Until this point, the 2014 Total Security, performed like any other software. However, in terms of product support, the support I have received from Bit Defender has been anything but helpful or positive. Disappointing to say the least."
Mahfud Rasmussen,6,5,"I made a ""big mistake"" by not reading properly the add/promotion sent on my News letters. I thought that I will get the BD Internet Total Security 2015 for the same Price as the BD Internet Security 2015 and purcharged it. When trying to install it I realised my mistake as my prior License key was rejected as ""Not valid for this product"". I contacted the BD Support and explained my problem, and in no time after openning a ""New Open Ticket"" they solved my issue by canceling my purcharged BD Total Security and transferred the 365 days validity to the remaining days of my BD Internet Security 2013. Thanks a lot to the team."
Hans Arends,1,5,"Bitdefender Internet Security 2015 behaves very modest on the background but is very keen on pointing out an abuse!The online service works outstanding and responds prompt and vigorously on support requirements.I am trying out Bitdefender now for more than a month, after using Norton Intenet Security, and are until now very charmed of this product!"
Tomasz Klosowski,1,5,"I would recommend it to everybody. Yes, I really would. Because even if there are problems - and we all know that nowadays that's inevitable - their Team stands by you in person, not in virtual machine."
Reinard,1,5,"After scanning with Total security 2015, picked up and cleaned up virus and malware which went undetected with other paid AV products.The support and turnaround time of Bitdefender is awesome! I would definitely recommend it."
Bill,1,5,"I have had several antivirus services over the years.  None of them leave a phone number where I could get questions answered or problems resolved, leading to my search for a different vendor.  The email trouble shooting process or the 'Q&A'' generic solutions offered on line, with other vendors, was always poor and did not target my issues.  Since switching Bitdefender, I  have contacted you several times over the last few years.  You always picked up the phone immediately and worked with me to resolve issues.  This great customer service has been quickly disappearing in many industries.  It is so nice to get that kind of personalized service with you!  Keep it up!!"
Rob Del Torto,1,5,"Out of nowhere I was having issues connecting  to several web sites. Bitdefender upgraded me to the newest product for FREE and customer servise talked me through correcting the issue. I have been using their product for several years based on reviews and never had an issue until recently. It turned out that it was no fault of their product and after having dealt with their customer service, I'm convinced they are truely the BEST. Thank you Bitdefender, You are a ""10"" in all ways."
Dave,11,5,Gives peace of mind for little outlay and support is good too.Detects all kinds of malware and finds/locks/wipes and/or rings your phone when lost (map display on your main PC).
Arnie strope,1,5,"After trying the free version, I still had a little problem the ads kept popping up.   I opted to try the paid version thinking I could return if dissatisfied!    It installed so easy, seemed to be thorough, and I did email support about a final problem ( I didn't secure empty trash)  support was quick, and everything is back to normal.   With the addition of online protection as I browse.   Thanx"
Andrew Mcknight,1,5,"As if I was talking to a friend eh! Well  I would have to say "" Don't boggart that joint & pss it here Vin!P.S. You guys & gals (if applicable) Have a wonderful day and keep up the excellent work!"
Ken Dixon,7,5,i have been using Bitdefender for around two years now with no problems. The only query I had on renewal a renewal code and my query was answered within 24 hours.
Butch,1,5,".I purchased BitDefender Total Security 2014 last Christmas. I had been a loyal Kaspersky client for four straight years but I did not like the background, continual, scanning. That scanning felt to me to use way too many of my PC's resources, and the PC felt sluggish. I seen that BitDefender was rated higher than Kaspersky at the time so I jumped ship and purchased BitDefender Total Security 2014. AM I PLEASED THAT I DID !!!!! It's been almost a whole year now and I remain PLEASED AND IMPRESSED with the ease of use and setup. Then a Bitdefender email arrived that asked me to pay $39.95 to upgrade to Bitdefender's 2015 product. I emailed Bitdefender asking why I should pay to upgrade, even though I have to pay to upgrade many of my other softwares when a newer ""full version"" is introduced. To my AMAZEMENT, BitDefender's customer service rep; Corina replied WITHIN THE SAME DAY !!! Corina kindly and RESPECTFULLY informed me that once I have purchased their product, it remains upgradeable at NO CHARGE during the LIFETIME of the license I purchased. Simply put, if I had EVER been responded to as quick and as kindly from Kaspersky I probably would never have bought BidDefender. I just bought ANOTHER YEAR because I'm so happy with Corina's professional conduct and BitDefenders efficient Anti-Virus software that has ""sent me back to safety"" at least THIRTY TIMES since I bought my license. I rate BitDefender 11-teen outta' 10 !!!!Butch 20141031.."
Jos  Schulpen,3,5,Ik ben heel tevreden over Bitdefender. Goede service gemakkelijke installatie zowel op mijn PC en Mac.Google Translation: I am very happy with Bitdefender. Great service easy installation on both my PC and Mac.Jos
Geoff,4,4,"I was more than a little put out at first. My renewal of Bitdefender was almost due & so I looked firstly at some alternatives but after a trouble free years usage previously, I decided I could do a lot worse than purchase a further years subscription. I downloaded the install file & ran it. That's when the problems started. Several times it froze during installation & when I did finally get it running I found my period of usage was still only for a couple of days. I made several more attempts at installing from the original download file, but was not able to complete successfully. During the ensuing period, I opened a 'ticket' through the website & conversed with a couple of agents Although they tried to help, the advice was rather predictable, as in, try re-installing or re-downloading the install file. All pretty obvious steps I would have thought. Eventually in desperation I looked at the Bitdefender folder within Windows & came across a file named ''bdwizreg.exe' entirely at random. Double clicking this file opened Bitdefender at the stage where it prompts you for the registration key Although, obviously, this should occur during the normal install routine, in fact it never reached that stage. However, after entering the registration key, the programme ran perfectly. Even extending the expiry period to the full year! A very haphazard way of achieving a successful install. I was on the point of opting for a refund (which had been offered along the way by a Bitdefender agent), but now that the programme is actually running I happilyaccepted the agents' offer to extend the expiry period by a further three months. A strange experience, but one which eventually worked out fine. So, the main problem, as far as I can see, seems to lie with the 'install file'. I seem to recall problems of a similar nature 12 months ago, but they were also overcome & as I stated, I am happy, now, to continue using Bitdefender."
anjujacob20,1,5,I am very happy to experience the customer caring aspect of Bitdefender software. Bitdefender  is with  customers 24/7 to help them out for solving their issues. What else a customer need more than this.
Arthur,11,5,"I have used Bitdefender for a number of years and always found it to be easy to use. Their latest upgrade for 2015 is even better than the 2014 version, again it is very easy to use and set up,  I had had to use their customer services on a couple of occasions and they are very quick with an answer if you have a problem. You don't even have to explain the problem as Bitdefender analyses your computer and sends the results to their server. Fantastic Company, will renew again next year."
Anush,1,5,"Been fully satisfied with the level of protection Bitdefender has been providing. Their customer  service is a very personalized experience. The autopilot mode is really true to their slogan install and forget. My system does not lag due to the antivirus. It's the best product to keep your system safe. Would recommend this software to anyone, its that good. And I want to thank the Bitdefender team for keeping my systems safe."
jc ayers,2,3,"For the second year in a row I had to call BD tech support just to renew my subscription. They sent me an email with a discounted renewal rate. But when I tried to renew using the links, no discount was available. I also wanted to upgrade to the 2015 version while extending my existing subscription, but no way to do that using links provided by BD. So it took two calls and 20 minutes just to renew. WHAT A WASTE."
Pat Sotis,1,5,I recently had an issue stating my facebook was corrupted.  There was nothing I could do; I contacted company and was upgraded to the 2015 version of Bitdefender.  The problem was a false/positive notice.Thanks guys-you had me worried for a moment.  All is well.  Nice service techs.
Tyler Franz,5,5,"Thi s is the BEST internet security suite I have ever used! When first installed, you can choose to let Bitdefender set the profile for you, and autopilot does exactly the rest. The firewall and antivirus protection is the very best in my opinion, it has not allowed any type of malware onto my computer! In addition to tuneup tools that allows you to clean up old files, and registry entries that are keeping your computer from running at its maximum performance, with just one click of the optimizer button! I have used other competitors antivirus, and NOTHING comes even close! BITDEFENDER has NO WEAK LINKS!"
Carmen,1,5,"I called customer service three times in one day and got the same person twice, I could not believe I was so lucky, I was pleasingly surprise because this gentleman was very, very helpful and his voice, my o my I told him he sounded like a pilot and he said he use to work on a plane. He was so pleasant and he took the time to make sure I understood what I was doing and everything worked. I must say having used customer service from other companies this was the best of the best."
Alan Henley,4,5,The Bit defender anti virus product is outstandingProbably one of the best available if not the best.Support is also very good for an Internet company.
Rick Okada,1,5,Service rep Vladimir was very professional and knowledgeable and solved the problem in short order. Way to go Vladimir.
George Wheeler,2,5,IT IS THE THIRD YEAR WTH BITDEFENDER AND CAN ONLY TALK GOOD OF THE PRODUCT
Rosta Plachý,4,4,I am really very satisfied!
Eric,1,5,"I had a unique challenge to Bitdefenders' firewall solution. The issue was resolved quickly and efficiently by a expert support team. Though my implementation was likely not commonplace, I feel I was treated as equitably as if though it were. A modern product I recommend from home use to enterprise."
randall poff,2,5,"Fastest antivirus I've used.  Doesn't use up a lot of system resources.  Doesn't slow down my system.  Love the various tools that are included to keep the everyday maintenance caught up, without buying a lot of extra software.   I had an issue and emailed tech support late at night, had my answer the next morning.....the email contained all of the necessary actions to rectify my situation..I've owned a PC since 1985....this has been the best antivirus I've used for my particular needs......."
Janet Desrochers,1,5,Recently purchased Bitdefender 2015. I had some issues downloading due to a problem with my PC. My reply from tech support was quick and the instructions were easy to follow. Bitdefender runs seamlessly on both of our PC's!
USMC@64298,4,5,"Bit Defender's security has protected my family's PC, iMac and two tablets for over two years. We have never experienced an intrusion. They provide proactive, up-to-date and tight security against constantly evolving viruses, malware and other intrusion attempts.  My confidence in their vigilance is expressed annually in my automatic renewals.  Thank you Bit defender team!"
Brian Wilkes,1,5,"Bitdefender is a company that meets it's obligations. Cyberspace is crammed with free offers and outlandish claims by get-rich-quick operators that fleece and flee. I recommend to you Bitdefender Security for three reasons: first, value for money security; second, integrity; and third, it's customers are valued and treated personally. Brian Wilkes."
Jim Allen,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender Total Security for three years and have found the product to be excellent. If I did experience a problem the support staff were extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of their product. I would recommend Bitdefender to everyone who owns a computer for the best antivirus coverage!!
Tom Currie,10,1,"Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is the single worst program I have ever seen in over thirty years using computers.  I have had this garbage on my computer for about two hours now -- I would have uninstalled it an hour ago after finding out just how bad it is, except that there doesn't seem to be any way to remove it once it gets its claws into your computer.  The so-called User Guide claims there is a remove option in the menu, but this is false. You can't stop the program from Windows Task Manager, you can't even turn it off from its own control screen.  It ties up all your CPU time and constantly keeps displaying different numbers of files that it claims are infected or quarantined and keeps wanting you to restart the computer -- but no matter how often you restart and no matter how often it says it fixed the problems it just keeps reporting the same thousands of files.   This program is WORSE than most viruses."
Kenn Papp,1,4,"This is an excellent protection product. It is easy to navigate and the tech assist is pretty fast, considering you have to do it via e-mail.The only complaint is that you have to wait for the scan and up-date to complete before you can open your browser. Other than that I would recommend Bitdefender for any protection-concerned user."
Karim,1,5,"Well I try it many anti viruses programs but really I found that bit defender program is a very powerful software that make you feel so secured from viruses, Trojans, worms beside the program is not slowing down the performance of the laptop which is very important for users, moreover the technical support team provide a professional service for that users for any issues occurs, I really like Bit defender and I do recommended a lot"
Geoff Turner,3,5,I had a question about using other security products in tandem with Bitdefender. Received a very quick response which not only answered my question but provided links to uninstall additional products which could cause conflicts. How refreshing to find a softare provider which goes the extra mile!
Clark Oehler,1,5,"Yes,I definitely recommend Bitdefender. Some technical misunderstanding were my own.After realizing such, I took corrective action to fix the issue(s).The Bitdefender Technical Service team has always been very courtesy to me,and I know that if I experience any future technical issues that require troubleshooting to Bitdefender's excellent technical service team,the reported issues will be resolved.One suggestion I would add is if Bitdefender would allow for longer periods of time than one day to one week for customer's to respond back to/with Bitdefender,I feel this would help.Many of us have at times and consistent vigorous stressful office,networking and work schedules to adhere to,and I feel if more customer/consumer oriented response times were reviewed and considered as Bitdefender customer and technical service policy,this would cushion and allow for a more comfortable time for Bitdefender customer/consumers to respond before support tickets and cases are closed. Thank you."
Richard Greene,2,4,"Bitdefender is a good program.  A little complicated for the beginner, but provides internet safety with a number of good programs.  Easy to install and learn how the program works."
John Dutton,2,1,Atrocious. Two years now and it's still darned near impossible to contact these people. I've had a gutsful. I've been trying to contact them for the last twenty minutes. NOTHING.
Andrew Dementyev,1,5,"Powerful, and at the same time is absolutely not a demanding user program! Acting on the principle of ""set and forget"" - exactly what we need for the majority of home users! We wish you a successful continuation of the project Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition! Stay with us! Thank you, Bitdefender!"
Richard,1,5,Excellent customer service for a great product.I highy Recommend Bitdefender to anyone serious about internet protection.
Mrs. Judy Tait,1,5,"I wanted to try a new anti-virus/total security software, so I did a Google search.  What seemed to stand out for its reviews and awards was Bitdefender.  So, I bought the software.  I have had a couple of problems along the way, but their Technical Support staff has been there for me the whole way and the problems were fixed every time.  I give Bitdefender,, the software and the staff, a total thumbs up!  Highly recommend!"
Bill Heilbronn,6,5,"I have always found Bit Defender and easy to use program.In a recent update, I accidentaly called for their ""wallet"" subprogram which called for using a password every time I opened the computer.A quick contact to their web site with a request as to how to turn off the facility resulted in an immediate answer that explained how to deselect and select the facility"
Alex Surugiu.,2,5,I really recommend using Bitdefender Total Security solution. I'm using for more than 4 years and it's clear the best one. They are so many good things to say about the Bitdefender... that I don't have the time for all of them. So the conclusion is... use Bitdefender with trust.
George B Pope,6,5,"I have used many different virus protection methods over the 50 years I have been a computer user and builder. When I changed to Apples IMAC I took a gamble on BitDefender in conjunction with MacKeeper and recently AVG cleaner; as I had bitdefender on my old Windows computer it was covering both and but was not required for Windows. Bitdefender Tech support were able to extend the coverage of my iMAc to almost 3 ears without costing me any more. I have recently had my ""Plastic Brain"" fail and needed to reset some passwords. BitDefender was extreamly quick and easy.Thank youG B P"
Haresh Shukla,1,5,Bit Defender Antivirus 2015 is really fantastic. I think all previous version problem is solved. Thanks for upgrading S/w.
Maarten,2,5,Nice appUser friendlyLight for your pcUp to date virus recognition
Seref,1,5,"Replaced hard drive, was unable to find download link from Bitdefender website to reinstall Total Security 2014 software which I purchased not to long ago, hence made the request by email for the link to download the software and before long I was sent the link and was given the latest version, 2015. So thank you for solving the issue and also giving me the latest version, much appreciated."
bozonose,2,5,"I have used software of several brand name security and virus protection brands but until I switched to Bitdefender 5 years ago, all of the other brands still let in viruses and made my computer crashed. Now my computer is safe and never fails me. They even contact me to alert me to my subscription status near renewal time. I am a happy 5 years user of Bitdefender and will stay true to the brand. Thank You."
Fillup Rasmussen,1,5,"Great support, the only negative is that it was difficult to hear the tech.  I don't know if this was the phone system's fault or if the tech could not speak louder.Need to put on the phone support page the following info:  Your phone call to BitDefender may incur international telephone fees.  Please make your telephone call in a quiet room that is also free from distractions."
bill gayle,1,5,Thanks so much for the quick response and clearly defined resolution steps. I was very impressed with extremely fast solution to my problem
Fred Mills,1,5,"Bitdefender products are the best, accross the board, for having a team of reliable, intelligent and responsible people who will protect your devices and be available around the clock to assist in any way."
Charles Armstrong,1,5,I had some trouble on the install but the defender support team was great for figuring out my problems. They were great. I would recommend Bitdefender to anyone....
Don L,1,5,I just had some obnoxious computer difficulty and didn't even  feel like dealing with it. I sent a ticket to Bitdefender support and did what they asked and presto--my computer is clean. My wife says thank you.
leonhoen,1,4,"Because I'm familiar with software tools Bitdefender is a valuable tool. The only catch is that lesser experienced users have trouble with the software, because they don't always understand what to do. F.i. automatic mode scans every DVD which gives no hassle free computing for those who just want to watch a movie. It takes too long to start the movie. Safe but not hassle free."
David Sharrock,1,5,After reading positive reviews on Bitdefender Security I purchased and installed the product yestetday on 2 computers.  Before registering I had some questions and had immediate answers from the call in telephone line.  Later I needed some additional help on installing the software on a small notebook without a disk drive.  I tried the chat line and received excellent help and a download installer from Bitdefender Support Engineer George Paunescu.  My old security software stopped telephone customer support which is one of the reasons I changed yesterday to Bitdefender.  The product is up and running great today.  DS
Joshua,1,5,I've used BitDefender for many years and I've never had any problems with my computer since. I recommend BitDefender to everyone.

Abd Alilah Elallam,1,5,i love you so mach
Riaz Qureshi,1,5,"I tried many computer security programs (antivirus) in the past but in vain. Then 8 year back, one of my best friends, shared his experience and recommended me 'Bitdefender'. Since then Bitdefender won our trust by securing all computers at my home satisfactorily. The technical support is instant and program is highly trustable. I strongly recommend Bitdefender."
Phil,1,5,I had issues and they did not give up until all were resolved. Thanks again
Savvas Potitsopoulos,1,5,The best anti virus on the market it protect 100% and the support center by troubles is very trusty and i am with the service full satisfied!
rikkitik,1,5,"Used mcafee for years. when it came time to renew, wanted to pay with my paypal acct. couldn't get a link, so called customer service. he must of been having a very bad day, because he was the most rude and disrespectful person I have ever dealt with. anyway said I couldn't pay with paypal because they had to have a credit card on file for auto renewal. only persons that can use paypal are new customers and it was $30 dollars extra. decided to fire them all. deleted mcafee from my pc, and still had to use a special removal tool to get the rest of it out of my system, before I could download bd. so far im very happy with bitdefender ."
Martina Barry,4,5,"I had been searching for a great Antivirus for quite some time and tried many, including norton and panda, but none were satisfying until I found Bitdefender. I started using Bitdefender back in 2004. The first version I used was Bitdefender 8 Professional Plus. I was only a teenager back then and needed something that was easy to use, affordable and something I could depend on. Bitdefender gave me that. Bitdefender has proven itself as the best Antivirus software to me. I haven't had a virus on my pc since I started using it. Bitdefender has come a long way since then. With the launch of total security in 2009, I think, I saw it becoming more than just an Antivirus. Total Security has so many tools for my pc, including oneclick optimizer, pc clean up, disk defragmenter, registry cleaner and startup optimizer to name a few, and it also has fantastic privacy tools. I was able to give up quite a few other pc programs because of it. I am now using bitdefender for almost 10 years and couldn't be happier with it.  Bitdefender offers a 30 day full trial on all of its products, has many special offers if you choose to buy a subscription and is very affordable with these. The customer service is fantastic and responds very fast to any queries I might have. I would highly recommend Bitdefender to everyone."
Duane Birth,1,5,This was as straightforward an experience with the computer as I have had.
Robert J. Wassenaar,38,5,I stepped over from one well known manufacturer to Biddefender because it stands head and shoulders above the rest little less than one year ago. The possibilities have not disappoint me and have even surpassed my expectations.
Chris Moler,2,5,"I have had numerous anti virus software protection services over the years. Even our Cox email provides us with the option for free anti virus software, but the local companies (two of them) recommended Bit Defender to us about three years ago. We have used them since then and have had little to no issues over that entire time. I now have 5 units in my office, and this system has always worked for me. Recently they helped me with a transaction that was above the call, so thank you Bit Defender. You got my vote.Chris Moler, PresidentSTAAR Solutions"
dave single,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender now for almost two years. I have used a number of these type products and none of them come close to Bitdefender. I had several issues with my computer and had to configure it on two occasions recently.  In doing this i lost all data on my hardrive including Bitdefender. A short email to the support team and i was up and running, not only with a reinstall but a free upgrade from Total security 2014 to Total security 2015 with a host of new features. Mate this product rates the best with me, and i reccomend it to anyone who wants 100% safe cyber surfing."
Eddie Grayson,16,5,"Bitdefender Total Security is the best security package I have ever used, so glad I found it. I was so very frustrated with other packages which seem to take over the PC running updates. I never notice Bitdefender updating so it must work in the background without affecting performance. On the few occasions I have contacted their help desk my ticket has been delt with promptly and efficiently.  Reasons for changing packages were performance and customer service Bitdefender win hands down on both accounts. So far no reason to doubt that my PC is well protected from the nasties. Highly recommend however I am just a user and not an expert in Internet / mail security matters"
Aaron Rutledge,1,5,"I had a key-logger Trojan and an infected network malicious software Malwar that ate the HDD and disk drive on one of my network computers. Everything was compromised and close to destroying my gaming rig.  I had Bitdefender before , but uninstalled because I could not configure the interface.  Now they have auto-pilot and I am definitely a returning customer again. I installed the trial version and even in the middle of the night they helped me so much . I would and will tell all of my friends and family about it. Actual live support blew my mind , especially when was only 2 days after installing a trial . My thanks to the Bitdefender team."
Tony Sicuro,1,5,Their # 1 ranking says it all.  I have had Bitdefender for several years now and wouldn't use anything but Bitdefender.  Have had  no issues since using there software.
Solod Am-Aek,1,5,Fast service make me feel good and very impress.
Pulak Kumar Roychowdhury,1,5,Bitdefender is fast powerful liteFully secured and good looking userfriendly security software which is top reted by world. Thanks to Bitdefender.
David Storey,1,5,"I have used most anti-Virus programs over the years and then I came across Bitdefender. Started with the basic version and eventually moved to the complete package. Although at first a couple of issues which tech support assisted in the correction of these, issues were not with Bitdefender rather another piece of software on my system. For anyone looking for the all round best solution for fighting against the intrusions from outside and spoiling our computer enjoyment Bitdefender in my opinion is the best on the market today."
John Morris,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for a few years now and I can honestly say they are the best--in speed, detection, tools and support. Years ago I worked for Norman Data Defense Systems and was exposed to many AV software vendors. I have used quite a few products, some as primary tools, others in specific instances. I once had a case, a tough one, where Bitdefender was the only tool that worked. I began using it more often as my ""go to"" fix and, over time, I was completely dedicated to the product. Now, you may see a variety of stats published by the multitude of computer security magazines, websites, blogs, forums, etc. and sometimes Bitdefender may be beat out for speed or detection or some other facet of a particular  product ""shoot out"" but I will tell you to take these tests with a grain of salt. Often they are biased by one thing or another--industry politics, money, friendships, pick a possible motive. In the end, the Bitdefender product suite comes out on top, always works, and if for some reason there is an issue the excellent support team is dedicated to finding a resolution, fix or offering timely help. They are quick to respond to any concerns. As for their business model, I can attest that their clients are highly valued and the company is honest--they stand 100% by their mission statement:  “We are here to defend the welfare of all users, no matter the platform, the nature of the user nor the magnitude of the challenge. We will do whatever it takes to keep computer users safe from harm and help the Good prevail. Always.”I give Bitdefender my full and highest recommendation.John Morris--former IT Security industry Sales Engineer, current Simulation & Game Development student"
Maulik Shah,1,5,"I had problem registering as the purchase was from other country which i was not aware . So i sent mail to customer support & i got an immediate response with the solution . I still have not used the product , so i cannot give feedback about the product but yes i am 100 % satisfied as far as Customer support is concerned. Being in Sales & Marketing i think Customer satisfaction means a lot to retain the customer & fetching more business as well , as word of mouth publicity works the best across the universe."
Lawrence Robinson,1,5,I had a problem with spyware and virusesthat jammed my system. I ordered bank checkson-line but because of corruption in my computerthey could not process my order. Bit Defender cleaned everything up and I got my problems solved.
Joseph Lam,1,5,"I have found Bitdefender total protection to my satisfaction, particularly the responses received to my enquiries and problem solving. I would recommend it to anyone who needs PC/Internet protection."
Stephanie Matuza,1,5,"I've been a Bitdefender customer for several years and I am very satisfied with their service.  Whenever I've had an issue, whether it's with the software, installation or whatever else, they have always answered my emails promptly.  You are assigned a person that will stay with you until the problem is resolved.  Also, they don't take DAYS to get back to you.  So far, I will get a response either the same or next day.  This is a very important feature to me....good customer service!  I highly recommend Bitdefender Security to everyone."
A.  Franklin,1,5,"As the owner of a tech business, it's my job to recommend the best products for my clients' PCs. I've personally used many different anti-virus products through the years but, Bitdefdender has the others beat. The depth of coverage without taxing the system resources is incredible and the learning curve isn't overwhelming for my customers.  There isn't another AV package on the market that offers what Bitdefdender does for the price or for the peace of mind."
Waldo_14,1,5,"Best Program EVAAAA.!!!!there's probably another user who bragged on this program so i'm just going to agree with what he/she said..only thing im going to add is the tech service online. They respond quickly and are willing to help idiots who respond to the question ""What type of computer do you have"" by answering "" The white one""... yup, these people  are pretty much bored.. They sent me 2 links to upgrade my software... I just had to click twice and the antivirus system was upgraded within seconds.. im not joking.. within seconds!!! it was that easy!!!"
Rich,2,5,HiI have been using Bit Defender as my AntiVrus Software for over 5 years. It came recommended by a computer savvy friend' . I have had an odd problem (not due to the software) but their customer support team have solved the problem quickly every time. I have no hesitation in saying it is better than some of the well known av software and does not mess your pc up unlike some of the preloads purchased with a computer.
Michael Murfitt,3,4,"Having used Bitdefender internet security for the last 12 months I am totally satisfied with the way it works and the minimal affect on pc speed. However when I clicked renew the price offered caused me to have second thoughts, but when I saw in PCpro a special deal £20 for 1 licence I took the offer. Had problems getting the new licence accepted even after totally removing software and rebooting, still showed 15 days remaining but email to Bitdefender support soon provided answer and now all fine."
Thomas Hatfield,1,5,"As a long-time computer programmer, I can see the quality of efforts and results for BitDefender -- so, I'm glad to pay for their top-rated protection and peace-of-mind."
Ms l,10,5,When i eventually gave up trying to install my new bit defender myself and contacted Bit defender. The first person gave advice & uninstallers for old Bitdefender stuff. No luck with getting new program on. second person went through the programs with me until i identified an unknown McAfee program that was stopping installation. even provided an uninstaller but it did not work. however he empowered me to sort this out by getting an up to date uninstaller and voila problem solved. Dignity intact and one happy user.
Michael Watts,1,5,"Bitdefender internet Security is the Best as when I start my Computer there are no Delays on Start up time, unlike other internet Security I have tried where start up is very Slow sometimes taking over 2 minutes to Start. But Bitdefender starts with in seconds.I highly recommend Bitdefender to anyone who is looking for a Internet Security that Keeps you safe while Browsing the Internet.always knowing that your always safe while online & keeping your Files Securer. I rate Bitdefender 10 out of 10."
James Moore,3,3,"I like your product. BUT you need to make certain functions easier. If you could model your product like I Obit. I would uninstall I Obit. I Obit has certain functions that helps my computer that Bit Defender does not offer. When I started with Bit Defender, I was under the assumption that your system would remove any virus infection I have. Your product only blocks certain viruses it does not remove them. I Obit removes my viruses.  I downloaded your program based on best reviews. I would like to have a program to block, remove and quarantine viruses. I want a program that functions by itself without uploading or downloading tools. I should have all the tools at my disposal at all times. I want a program that will ensure my internet security and virus protection at 100% on auto pilot.  Look at advance care systems from I Obit and explore the possibilities. I want my Email programs monitored for spam by your system. I want all of my files scanned weather in a vault or not without password use 10,000 times. I Obit Offers a Uninstaller, Security Mail ware viruses removal! Defragmentation, Driver updates. The cost of your programs are 20% more and quite complicated to average users."
Thomas Morgan,2,5,"Bit defender I was a sceptic about this company but no more I got allthe help and advice, top of the range no messing and I am not a spring chicken and no expert on computers it pays to deal with the best.I say get it  and ant you wont look back.Thomas."
Caren Baker,1,4,"I'm finding it somewhat expensive to add additions to the basic program.There appears to be no threat that has not been addressed. I don't always understand written instructions. This is still a challenge with Bitdefender, though improved. It could be just my poor conception of things in general, but I'm starting to understand the purpose intended. I already have a basic understanding of online protection services. I chose the protection software for Windows 8/8.1. Thanks for making a program specifically geared to my operating system."
Sumayya Patel,7,5,"I have been a Bitdefender customer for the past two years and I shall be renewing my annual membership once again. Having encountered several antivirus software over the past few years, Bitdefender absolutely stands out as a winner. It is simple to use, trustworthy to keep your device free from infection and maintaining high performance all the time. Always reliable too so that you know you're in safe hands when it comes to an antivirus software. It's very easy to operate, practical, everything from installation download to scanning your device requires simple application to keep your device free from infection and maintaining high performance. My customer service experience has been excellent, helpful and 100% resolved in just a phone call, immediately. Bitdefender lives up to its name and standards!"
Toby Blammon,1,5,Read loads of reports about how this anti-virus and that anti-virus did this and that tried them all But this bit-defender really does do the business and most importantly is doesn't hog your computer its lets you still your machine.
Ed Moritz,1,5,"I first tried Bitdefender in 2011 and it has done a perfect job ever since.  It occasionally warns me of a threat and I retreat immediately.  Nothing has slipped by, though. Excellent customer service, too.  When I have had a problem, the response has been quick and helpful.Great program."
Jon James,4,5,Had massive problems with tech support of Kaspersky (not working on weekends and holidays!!). Contacted Bitdefender to see what their tech support would be like. Got a speedy response on the same day when the OTHER av company wasn't helping their customers.DUMPING Kaspersky and going with Bitdefender asap!
Yi Tsou,1,5,Bitdefender support team do a great job!
steve b.,1,4,it's a bit difficult to understand what does what. i really don't understandeverything or it's function. but if it works and i set the functions assuggested i feel safe and put my trust in bitdefender. maybe a morelengthy description of what everything does would help the not sosmart like me.
Anthony Balch,1,5,"This application has been my favourite for several years now. I am very conscious of safety when working with my PC on the Internet and because Bitdefender rates high on every comparison table I have seen I have no hesitation in using it and even paying extra for the Premium Version.  If you want safety, reliability and excellent back-up service Install Bitdefender - you will not regret it."
mr Dennis W Parker,5,5,"I had a lot of security problems before I installed bitdefender total security, 2012,2013,2014 and now 2015, now I have no problems at all, absolutely brilliant."
Jor Cookie Imvu,1,5,"This has to be the absolute best program to protect my computer.It is non intrusive, it provides safety when using internet banking, it keeps all of your information safe.I can be running a system scan whilst doing a vulnerability scan at the same time and my laptop runs with maximum performance.I have told many people about Bitdefender. It is hands down the best. Well done!!"
Dwight Coles,3,4,"Bitdefender Internet Security has been a good, effective product for protecting a couple of Windows platforms.  Simple to use, seems to stay updated well, catches the occasional cookie-based identity tracker package, too.Just wish the licensing was slightly clearer and that BitDefender would accurately record what annual version you have updated to and then bill renewal with the correct version in their notice.  The renewal key works with whatever version you are running, so if they get fuzzy on their concept of what version you are on, it's not much of a big deal."
Laura Hoffos,1,5,"I couldn't get some of my software to work and I do take my gaming seriously, these days. After consulting on line with a Bitdefender Tech, they fixed the problem and even did more than they had to. Many told me this was the best program, but, they didn't tell me they had the best team as well."
Saba Khodabandeh,1,5,"From the first time i was advised to install Bitdefender for my PC security, I just got to know the best Anti-virus service in whole world. There is no virus that can stand the power of this dragon and i feel totally safe while I see its icon on my desktop."
Alfredo Pichardo,1,5,"YOU KNOW, I ALMOST WENT BACK TO ANOTHER RENAMED SECURITY PROGRAM BECAUSE OF REVIEWS BUT AFTER TESTING THE REFERRED PROGRAM MADE THE DECISION TO GO BACK TO BITDEFENDER LATEST INTERNET SECURITY 2015. IT WORKS SUBLIME AND I WILL NOT CHANGE IT FOR ANYTHING ELSE.TEST IT SOONEST POSSIBLE AND YOU WILL FIND OUT, PLUS THE TECHNICIANS ARE ALWAYS READY TO ASSIST YOU. THE PROGRAM IS FAST AND SECURE."
Luke,1,4,"I have always liked Bitdefender Internet Security, but over the last couple of years I have been very annoyed with the unsolicited popup offers. I am glad to see that this has been rectified, in the 2015 version, with the addition of an option to turn them off (better late than never). I am a little worried by the Firewall however, which seems to work on autopilot, even when autopilot is turned off. Meaning that if it lets a new program connect to the internet that I don't want to connect, then I need to go into the settings and change the allow to block manually. What happened to ""paranoid mode""? I prefer to be asked before letting any software connect to the internet. Other than that I am very pleased with the product."
J J,1,5,I was getting all kinds of viruses and funny things happening. So I contacted Bitdefender and they soon sorted things out for me..
David M Burns,1,5,"bit defender has been outstanding in standing by me when my computer crashed, they promptly answered my questions and guided me in re-installing their product and also advised me when they had an update available. so many other companies forget you once you pay them, but not bit defender! I am using total security for home, and swear by it."
James Kingman,3,4,"I have used Bitdefender for many years and think it's the best Antivirus software. However their upgrade notices always offer a great renewal price which always turns out to be more when you get to the website. If you contact the Customer Care team you will get the price offered, but I've had to do this for 2 years running now which is tiresome."
Scott Foreman,1,5,"By nature, I'm suspicious of most things I don't know much about.  The fact Bitdefender was rated the best antivirus by a company I knew of and respected caused me to give it a try.  A big discount from the published price factored into my decision as well.Since using Bitdefender for almost a year now, I can honestly say it has kept me out of trouble and protected my computer to the point where trust it completely.  I still use common sense about opening unsolicited emails...they hit the junk box immediately.  If you try it, I think you'll like it.  I recently signed up for my second year at a huge discount.  Always like saving a buck."
Elizabeth van der Riet,1,5,"What I like about Bitdefender is that they are constantly improving on their product, making installation easier and the actual software does not slow down the computer in any way.  I would just like Bitdefender to improve on the Wallet tool.  For me this tool is still a grey area in that when I access a site requiring passwords, etc Wallet does not activate and fill in the details automatically in spite of having added sites requiring passwords.  But this in know way will deter me recommending Bitdefender to anyone or stop using the package for myself.  Over the years I have really enjoyed owning this product and will continue to make it my own!"
stacey,1,4,...2 qualities uncommon in customer service these days.
Torsten,1,5,Win7 - homegroup / home network was not recognised after changing internet provider and in spite of upgrading to new 2015 BD TS version - solved with 2 emails within 72 hours. Thank you BD service team
Douglas Demlow,2,5,"Recently I was ready to improve my computer security.  On several websites I noticed that BitDefender received top ratings, so I knew I had to check it out for myself.  Truthfully, as great as the ratings were, they really didn't come close to telling the whole story about the product.  First, it is extremely comprehensive in all of the protection it provides to you and your electronic devices.  Second, if you have questions, they have made the User Manual very user friendly.  Finally, and this is the neat part, I had a couple occasions to contact support which proved to be just as impressive as the product.  They were prompt with their response, the response was right 'on target' in answering my question, and they did it very courteously and professionally.  How refreshing it is to find a company that really cares about customer service!  I have no reservations about recommending BitDefender to everyone!"
Doug Tarella,1,5,Bitdefender works seamlessly in the background and doesn't interrupt your work- which is a huge improvement from other anti-virus programs I have used. I had a problem with some remnants of McAfee on my computer and Bitdefender tech support sent me the information and links to McAfee's website to uninstall. Incredible experience- simply unexpected in a world where good customer service is as rare as hen's teeth!
Jim,1,5,Did a scan  with my Bitdefender. Came up 2 things it could not clean.Contacted customer service and they sent me instructions to sendthem scan results. The sent me back detailed instuctions on whereto find the program and how to get it out of my system.
JP,1,5,I've been using Bitdefender for 4-5 years and after a trial installation decided to install it on 6 computers of family members that I take care of.  Customer service has always been quick and helpful.
Andrei Radulescu,3,5,"Bitdefender has a good product as well as excellent customer support. From the many companies that I've interacted with, Bitdefender is one of those very rare companies for which the thought of having to contact customer support doesn't make you cringe. They are knowledgeable, professional, effective and eager to help; and they do this consistently. I strongly recommend them."
roze albina,2,5,"I had been looking for a reliable antivirus ware but was unsure of what to buy. I read the high ratings on Bitdefender and tried it. I don't regret it what-so-ever. It is the best protection for your computer. It takes care of any spyware, virus, or threats that come against your computer. All I know is that I will never use another antivirus ware again. Also if you have any problems, they will resolve them and are more than generous with your solution. Thank you Bitdefender!"
samdav7,1,5,I like my Bitdefender Total Security programIt's piece of mind .. set it and forget it .. Autopilot feature does everything required for total protection in the background ( 24/7 none stop ! )
Geoff Ranson,2,3,"Once installed the product worked well.The problem for me was getting the installation to work, the Bitdefender website was useless, it just kept sending me round in a loop asking me to buy the product again.The ""helpline"" numbers manned 24 hours a day just rang out with no answer all very frustrating.I eventually found another number, got straight through and the software link was sent no problems.Pity the first link sent did not work"
sadek_za,1,5,This will be my fourth year with Bitdefender and  I am highly satisfied with the product's performance. It usually indicates beforehand which sites are safe or not and will signal immediately when risky sites are encountered while surfing the net. Bitdefender does not encumber the functioning of my PC in any way as I've noticed some other programs do. Its scanning of the machine is extremely thorough while it also ensures that essential updates get installed whenever they are available. Bitdefender renders me a very high degree of safety and secutity and I will recommend it to anyone anytime. sadek_za
Paul Larocque,1,5,"This product is excellent for anyone that wants to have a program running in the background and doing all the work for you.  It is very stable and does not bog down your system.  It also does what it is suppose to do, which is help protect you from malware/spyware and viruses.  The features that come along with this product are very convenient and for the price of what you are receiving is definitely worth it."
Cheryl Wearne,1,5,a pleasure to deal with BitDefender they are so professional and helpful.  Your queries are answered promptly and the seek to find solutions to any problems and are always willing to assist. Very refreshing to find this kind of service today.  Definitely a 5 stars and congratulations. Keep up the great work. And Thank You for resolving my issues.
Curtis Smith,2,5,I had some issues with false positives regarding Microsoft Visual Studio development platform where I had to turn off my Bitdefender in order to code and debug. I also noticed that Bitdefender tries to modify my web browser which I had to deny it permission in order to use my browser correctly. Also be careful with the aggressive registery cleaner and duplicate files finder although it comes with a system restore feature. I recently upgraded to Bitdefender Total Security 2015 and am pleasantly surprised at its operation and features. It has always protected me over the years and provided great customer support. It is easy to install and uninstall if  you want to make modifications to your system. I feel much safer and more confident on the internet with Bitdefender on my system. I am greatly pleased with the new version 2015 and will continue to purchase and use this product as it has improved my system quality and performance enormously. Thanks Bitdefender Team!
Andy In Oliva,3,5,Bitdefender is great value for money and SafePay is superb.
Brian Brigg,3,5,"My original review, still retained below, was made some time ago. i have installed Bitdefender Total Security 2016 several times recently on different systems and I can say that Bidefender has improved the install experience so that it is now mostly trouble free. Whereas previously I had to remove a disk from my system to get the install to work this is no longer the case.The download portion seems to work better now with no problems even on my often patchy connection. The scan process works more smoothly too with far less time taken than the earlier version.The only caveat with the new version is that SSL connections over Firefox were failing all the time. I had to turn off SSL scanning to be able to make connections over SSL. Chrome works okay even with the SSL scanning enabled but I like Firefox and having to turn off some protection to be able to use my choice of browsers is not optimal.Below is the original review of the 2015 version of the product.*********************************************************************************Bitdefender should check the default browser during install and then give a warning to the user about the problem. Once this has been sorted out I would consider the suite fully worthy of 5 stars.I had been using another security suite for some time even though I had a valid license for Bitdefender so when I received an email about a new version (2015) I decided to try it.The security suite works well with a light footprint and almost no required interaction from the user. Bitdefender Total Security scores very well on independent reviews so I feel that my computer is well protected.The biggest hurdle to overcome is installation. Installation is done using a live installer and is in three parts. The first is a system scan, the second is downloading while the third is installing.The scanner kept locking up at 89% on my system. I tried searching the internet for a solution and found one which was on Bitdefender&#39;s own forum but I was not allowed (Sorry, you are not permitted to use this board) to view the solution even after signing in to my Bitdefender account.I later found that you need a separate account from the &quot;MyBitdefender&quot; account that all users have to view the forum. I view this as being a very poor policy from Bitdefender. I wasn&#39;t asking to post a message, merely to SEE a resolution to a problem that is fairly common if I can believe the search results.I have three drives, one MSATA for the system and programs, one conventional drive for the data files and a third which mirrors the data files using a synchronizing program. This simplifies my backup to cloning the MSATA drive after significant updates.I unplugged the backup drive and tried again. The scanner reached 100% and the download began! The download stopped before reaching 100%. I don&#39;t blame Bitdefender for this as my connection can be unstable. I cancelled and restarted, happy to see that the download picked up from where it left off. After some time it stopped again.Cancelling and restarting the install, which requires a system reboot, got me the same result. This happened three more times but the fourth time it reached 100%. Great! No so fast! The install stopped at 27%. Restarting the installer again saw me back at the beginning with the installer scan halting at 89%.This went on for several iterations with varying results and the entire download was done about five more times, sometimes the progress bar for the download initially showed 100% but then ticked back to zero, maybe because of updates.I finally gave up and contacted support who gave me links to the remover and the full install package. These worked straight away.Bitdefender needs to do some work on the live installer. The progress bars sometimes appear to be stalled but the scan/download/install is still going on. Waiting ten or twenty minutes is not always enough to see any progress as I found when I removed and then reinstalled the program using the live installer.The scanner portion needs to show what drive it is scanning and restart the progress bar for each drive.The download portion should be broken up into main program and updates and show how many Mb it is downloading. Adding the download speed and estimated time of completion would also help.The install portion should show program modules then update installation separately. If the updates fail there should be no need to start the entire process again. Allow a restart and then have the local program download the updates in the background.My only issue with the program after installation is with the updates. The only information provided shows how current the update status is on a daily basis only. It doesn&#39;t show the last update time. The pulse updates from Norton may be a little gimmicky but they are informative.Kudos to Bitdefender for providing a very capable security suite which is, apparently, fully updated as installed. This is different to Norton, Eset, Outpost and many others which install easily but have huge updates required before they are usable."
Tilda Harder,1,5,I downloaded the free antivirus program. I had tried many ways to get rid of RRSavings ads and nothing worked. I had so many popups my computer was basically useless to me. I did not want to go back to factory default and tried Bitdefender.  It took care of the problem in the first scan! I am very impressed with the support team. They are very helpful and courteous.
zebra1944,3,5,"i have the best anti virus software bitdefender. i do not worry about anything,if i have a problem i just contact them and they will sort it out for me. how easy is that."
Зелимхан Мустапаев,1,5,no load on the system. very convenient to use. from phishing sites 100% protection.
Jasmine Maclean,2,5,"Customer support is really important to me and I was impressed with the excellent communication and support from Bitdefender.  The team gave me clear, precise and easy to follow instructions.  It was great to receive a reply email written so articulately and eloquent.  I loved the follow-up email to check how I got on too.  A good choice by me ... woop woop!"
Paul Stevens,4,5,"I had problems installing the new BDIS2015, which I had purchased to replace a soon to expire BDIS2013. I contacted the CC team and in less than 12 hours I received advice on what to do. Unfortunately it didn't work, so I contacted them again. I again received a reply in less than a day, asking that I send them a log. They examined this and advised me that I had traces of old IS products blocking the installation. I followed their advice and it installed without any further problems.  I installed the second licence on my wife's laptop - no problems. Up and running in less than 10 minutes."
Jason James,1,5,I have three laptops running Bit. I have had great customer experience via support when going thru upgrades which always seem to be free :-). I've put all my friends on this product and far as I know they have all had the same great experience I have. Cheer BitD
William Waltenberg,1,5,I've tried the others before and they failed to completely protect me or they used too much system resources or there were software issues but since coming to Bitdefender I no longer worry set it and forget it!
Tressa,1,5,"Bitdefender was recommended by my family computer ""guru"" .  I bought it for 3 of my computers.   When I had a little trouble loading it on the 3rd computer, I chatted with customer service.  The rep was very helpful and we resolved the issue easily.  I only know enough about computers to mess things up.  It was nice to have someone available who painlessly walked me through to resolution of the problem."
Virginia Spong,1,5,"Hi, had to speak up and say Bitdefender Total Security is very user-friendly and also most effective in clearing out those bugs.The Bitdefender Service Dept is efficient and responds with real solutions in a most timely manner - I mean, when the chips go down  it's great to know support is close by.Glad I bought the program.RegardsKen"
Marjie Correa,1,3,I feel very safe having Bitdefender on my pc's but very frustrated having to deal with someone I cannot understand when needing support. The issues get resolved but it is difficult and time consuming working with someone who's first language is not English. Marjie Correa
Veronica,1,1,"I work for a virtual office, so being online and available is very important to us. We also work with large companies around the country that want their data protected and free from viruses. Last year we used Trend Micro because it was offered with the new computers we got for the office, and there were no problems. It ran so seamlessly we didn't realize that a year went by. When it was time to get a new anti-virus we looked at Bitdefender. We went ahead and bought 3 licences and it collapsed our office. We installed it on our machines and the one machine the one with Windows 7 completely broke. It would not even turn on. On the newer ones it corrupted their hard drive, complete with random shut downs and failure configuring. One machine was recoverable but unfortunately, the other one had all kinds of files deleted that were unrecoverable. I talked to Bitdefender and told them about all the problems that had happened because of their software, but instead of offering me a solution, they tried to get me to upgrade my Bitdefender so that won't happen again. NO WAY! Most of the programs that were deleted were easily recoverable but I lost my Microsoft Office Suite and there is nothing they can do or and offered nothing to fix it. Never ever use this product."
Nikolay Ananiev,1,5,The is amazing and now I am feeling safe eith it. I recommenf it to everybody to buy and secure all your files and computer.
Marceda M. Guild,1,5,"Bitdefender is a great site.  It guards all of my banking and sites that need to be guarded, such as two banks, Discover, Paypal, & other important sites."
william freiwah,3,5,"I've had bitdefender since 2012 (Internet security) and have found it an excellent program. I've had to contact support a couple of times (I forgot a password I put in) and they usually replied within the next business day and had a reply specific to my case which solved it. The one time that the solution did not solve my issue, they upgraded me to Bitdefender 2015 at no extra cost, while still keeping all my account details. In general, I've found the internet security suite an excellent product, and the company offering excellent support for the occasional times when you would have to contact them. Very highly recommend."
Ignatious Jovith,1,5,Best automatic silent worker who takes care of all your computer's security concerns. Keep this good work forever.
Bruce Wilkinson,2,4,"I rely on products and services like yours because I don't have the skills/knowledge to protect my equipment on my own.  Therefore, when Bitdefender tells me (as result of a scan/report) that there were some issues detected, but it didn't do anything about them---I have to wonder what happens next.   I don't know if a problem/issue still exists, whether it is important or not, if it will be ""monitored"" in some way, if I am expected to make a personal contact to ask for follow-up.   If the report indicates  ""go to...."" for further info, I am already there, so I get no additional info."
Ciyborg,3,5,"Gaming, surfing or just plain document writing. Bitdefender is like a ghost in the wind, it works in the background and without interfering too much with whatever activity it is you're doing. The detection rates are solid and it has saved me a** a lot of times, be it on P2P connections or when gaming, got notified of a port attack scan or any other significant threats straight away. Its very seamless so donot worry about it effecting your work. Also, this is THE anti virus solution to go for if you're really the dora the expolorer of the internet. Customer service gets problems sorted out nicely too."
Gary,1,5,"After Acronis 2014 crashed my PC ( grrrr. thanks for that guys!!!), I had to reinstall Win7 and all programmes. Retrieving Bitdefender 2014 was too difficult. Using my laptop I contacted the Bitdefender team. Several attempts to resolve the problem failed. I was not confident due to some mediocre reviews about service written in 2013. On the contrary, Bitdefender kept coming back to me and asking if the problem was resolved. They did not let it drop! Eventually, I restated in plain English (no jargon), what the problems were; the “penny dropped” and a perfect remedy was provided to me. Full marks on your current Public Relations process Bitdefender team. Many Thanks."
richard,1,5,"The Bitdefender team is a truly professional, knowledgable group of people dedicated to doing all they can to make our life on the internet the safest possible.When you are installing upgrades or renewing your subscription you may get a website that will redirect you to a company who will say they can help you.Really they want to sell you their ""Maintenance"" service - AVOID THEM.One name I know from experience is iYogi.com from New Delhi India.AVOID - AVOID - AVOIDBitdefender is 24X7 - use them, trust them."
Michele Findlay,22,5,"Bitdefender is a super internet protection service. The program runs in the background without slowing the computer, it update regularly and since I have been using Bitdefender products (2013) I have had no viruses or infections of any kind on my computers. Additionally existing customers get really good money saving offers to renew their licences and helpful support when needed. I recently changed one of my machines over to a Mac and wanted to convert my 3 machine licence to include it. The Bitdefender people were very helpful in guiding me through the process and even added 120 days to my licence because of the slight difference in the product I had migrated to. Thanks Bitdefender, you are second to none."
Kori-shea Dupasquier,1,5,"Bitdefender is easy to download, install and use. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a friendly follow-up phone call to make sure I was satisfied with the software. It does a great job of blocking infected websites without slowing down my computer. Most of all I love the secure web browser for my online banking and how it doesn't bother me while I play games or watch movies."
Earnest Cox,2,5,I have used Bitdefender for the last 5 years and it has not failed me.  There have been several times while browsing the internet when a warning was given about the safety of a particular site and I have been directed.  The technical support has been spot on as well.
Corissa Yow,1,5,"I've had BitDefender Internet Security installed and running on my laptop now for two days and so far I'm glad I made the switch.  I've used both McAffee and Norton for years and have not been happy with the performance impact each of them had on my machine.  It does indeed seem to have a very small ""footprint"".  It was VERY easy to download and install.  I did have one small glitch:  after installing when I viewed my online dashboard it was not showing my laptop as device.  I hadn't yet activated my account.  I got online with BitDefender tech support (chat) and within a few minutes I had the problem fully solved.  It was really ""user error"", not the fault of BitDefender.  But I had a chance to test the online chat support and was pleased with their speed and effectiveness.  I feel confident that their 24/7 support will be there if I should ever need it in the future."
John,1,5,Bitdefender 2015 is easy to use and it really does protect my pc I have not had one virus issue since changing to Bitdefender. However I would like the temporarily disable feature to be easier to find and use as I found out after needing to roll-back my Windows and failed several times and had to resort to a full uninstall and install of Bitdefender to achieve.
sabrena rowley,1,5,"If you are looking for a friendly, honest, helpful company for security, cleaning of your computer, contact Bitdefender.  They have a free version and for more protection their upgrades are in the same range of other companies.  I was having a problem and e-mailed them about the problem, and was contacted immediately and the problem was resolved with two e-mails.  Well, try it and have the same great experience I had."
Vera Cringanu,1,5,"Considering that I have used for some years now Internetbanking, and I have navigated through hundreds of internet sites, and have downloaded and played a lot of games from internet without having any security problems as long as I have used BitDefender, there is nothing more to add!"
Pat Sierra,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for many years now and am very happy with it.  It feels like a true friend running in the background always there always reliable.  What more can you ask for.
Silver Scorch,1,5,"Even though practicing safe computing habits & executing common sense when browsing the Web or checking emails is like second nature to me, I know that I am no exception when it comes to the ever-growing threats of the Internet that seem to lurk around every dark corner of cyberspace; just as well, I am proud in knowing that my back is covered by the never-resting effort of my Bitdefender product. Light on resources but a heavyweight in effectiveness, this anti-malware suite has proven itself time and again over the past several years I have been a user: Trojans & port scans are constantly thwarted by Bitdefender's firewall; viruses & worms never stood a chance against its real-time behavioral scanner, whose admirable detection rate nailed them before they could do any damage, and infected websites failed miserably to deliver whatever blow they intended to hit my PC with; in the VERY rare instance something HAD initially gotten past my defenses, clean-up & removal have been a cinche and a half...Bitdefender's user interface is always comprehensive, appealing and easy to navigate. (Autopilot sounds nice, but I prefer to tweak the settings to allow maximum protection best suited to my needs, to get the most out of my product.) I like the widget that's always on my desktop, though I must admit I kinda miss the little scanner graph that showed real-time port traffic between my computer and the network that was available a few releases back.In addition, I found Bitdefender's Safe Vault feature to be quite handy, as I'm all about encrypting my sensitive data that I have stored on my devices with an extra layer of protection. Anything to make the worse-case scenario for me even harder for culprits.Just an awesome product overall, I wouldn't pay for anything else. Thanks, Bitdefender!"
Mike Deez,2,5,"I recently updated my PC rig and got a new one. Along with this new purchase I had to be sure that I got an antivirus protection service that was right for me. After my buddy told me how happy he was with Bitdefender, I did my homework on them and found the right plan for me. There were many to choose from. Although it wasn't that cheap it also was not very expensive. Money and bs aside, after I had my first problem with the PC I realized just how awesome these guys are! Problem was solved the next day. Anyone who gets this is definitely getting there money's worth."
Wayne Jones,1,5,Easy to set up and does great on antivirus and privacy applications. Have recommended to my work and my brother. Best and the price was great.
H1d5nough?,2,5,I purchased Bitdefender Total Security about 1 year ago and needed to also replace the internet security system on my other computer.  I had difficulties with passwords and messages. One phone call to Bitdefender and the rapid response and fantastic help solved my problems in minutes. A real asset to any business!!  Try Bitdefender before you go anywhere else.
Robert,4,5,"Some time ago my computer crashed and I had to rebuild my system. After that it turned out that the version of Bitdefender Total Security I use was unavailable on the Bitdefender's website.I contacted their Tech Support by e-mail. I got the reply AND the solution barely 45 minutes later! Not only did they solve my problem, but also offered further assistance in case something went wrong! That's what I call Customer Support and that's what confirmed that switching to Bitdefender was the right choice!"
David Feu,4,5,Gets consistently top reviews. Install & upgrade sytems work well. Intuitive user interface. Very helpful staff whenever I've had queries: even helped me with an issue that turned out to be unrelated to their product: very pleased.
Şakir Avcı,1,5,Bitdefender is hard working  so go with succesful.
Jean Troy,1,5,"To download the product and make it function, a piece of cake for a ""boomer lady""."
Amylar Shammary,1,5,World’s Best security system becomes easiest to use.
RB0411,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender since 2011 when I bought my PC. For me, it is the best antivirus because it has lot of features. My PC has not been infected since  I used Bitdefender."
Zardoc,2,5,"This is the second year that I have decided to move to Bitdefender. Not once have I been dissapointed. Why, because if something goes wrong, I call support and they try their best to fix the issue.Not one of my issues has remained unsolved so far.I have worked in computers for the past 15 years, this company is one of the top ten!"
zoran,1,5,"Bay this product, it is the best what I seen."
GeoffreyBobbles,3,5,"Having used a number of paid and free antivirus solutions - some were good, some were bad - after reading the great reviews for Bitdefender, I decided to instal it. I haven't looked back. I have never had a virus and I know AutoPilot is protecting my PC all the time. I have recommended Bitdefender to all my friends. Highly recommended, you won't regret it."
Manuel Sousa,1,5,"The software is very easy to manage, it doesn't bother at all. It so light you almost don't notice its there. A true silent protection..."
Hown Kwan,1,1,Its services freeze and stop responding almost every day!I tried to contact tech support via email several times.Its been more than one month now.But I still have no idea what is going on and no solution at all.Last reply was about one month ago and said 'currently working on it'.I sent several emails after that but no reply at all.So basically its useless.Ticket No: 2014061104130002All necessary info. and files have already been sent to bitdefender long time ago.
Ian McCulloch,1,5,"I had Bitdefender in the past and made the mistake of switching to another antivirus software. Not until I used the other for a while did I realize what a mistake I had made. The version I chose this time is Total Security and already it makes me feel totally secure, as do the Bitdefender representatives I dealt with before switching back to Bitdefender. You receive a quality product you can rely on along with quality people you can also rely on.If you pick any other product or company you have settled for less than the best and put your computer at risk."
KS101,2,5,"Try it. Very different to any other brand I have used before. Grateful to the Computer shop that recommended Bitdefender to me, after another product failed to prevent the blue screen of death from a Trojan on the old PC. Thanks Bitdefender for this simple, fast and effective product."
Konstantin,1,5,"Hello everyone, BIS established in 2015. Loaded system longer than usual. Why removed aggressive mode in the network screen? This is very bad. The product does not pass synthetic benchmarks and became very vulnerable and unstable. Firewall is very weak. And why in the product, system optimization function? Persistent messaging center support Vindovs that disabled firewall and anti-virus protection. Generally one disappointment. Previously used 360 IS+ Online armor, very strong defense, your product vomnogom inferior. Disappointed and I will remove your product. Have a nice day."
Kelly Rocheleau,1,5,"I have never had a problem with Bitdefender doing its job everyone I have recommended BitDefender too still at this time have also , I have even bought BitDefender at sale prices for people to try out and they still have it too. The Staff are magnificent as I had to phone twice over the years only because of dll problems of my making and they were always glad to help, and fixed my problem.. Kudos to Bitdefender Staff   P.S. just a phone call away, Im in Canada"
David G Anderson,1,5,"I could recommend Bitdefender as a complete protection package for your internet, banking.The customer service is very good and helpful."
Donald Campbell,1,5,"I like the way it does not require any user input.  It also has a very basic interface, which stops me from making choices which would reduce the effectiveness of the program.  Apart from the icon on the taskbar, there is no indication that the program is running, which is as it should be."
Doru Dumitru,1,5,"I really enjoy the antivirus, I had the chance to compare it with 3 others (Norton, Avira, NOD32) more and I can say it is far away better. In the last years became more friendly interface, and easy to use. I have activated the 2013 license in 2014, with 353 days left. I have purchased another license in 2014 which will be installed soon onto 3 other OS. I received 3 other licenses to recommend them to somebody else. I gave 2 licenses to somebody who needed them and never had the chance to use BitDefender. I still have 1, but I did not find the person yet. I really hope they will become user clients next year. In one computer, I have one dangerous virus, stored in a .rar file. It can destroy the OS in a second. The name and the proprieties were changed, I know where it is and I know that BD find it every time it is scanning, compare to the others 3."
Chris,6,5,"When I purchased Bitdefender for download about 10mths ago I wanted to test it's abilities on my laptop before downloading it onto my wifes PC.Bitdefender has worked flawlessly since installation on my laptop running windows 7.As the software was purchased for use for up to 3 computers I was ready to install Bitdefender on my wifes PC. I had misplaced the the download link email from Avangate (bitdefenders software supplier) so I needed to contact Tech Support.The Support technician ""George"" listened to my concern, was very understanding and polite and immediately sent the download link to me after confirming my account details.Great service what more could you ask for?Chris PMelbourne, Australia"
Terry MacDonald,3,5,"I've used various Bit Defender products over the past 5 plus years.  In the time I've been most satisfied with their products and their support.  So in a nut shell yes I'd recommend Bit Defender Anti Virus, Internet Security, and Total Security to anyone who might be thinking of purchasing coverage."
Gilbert,1,4,"when i bought your product the first thing that made me choose your product was the 24h service but to my absolute dismay it was not avalable in my country witch is Canada in 2014 this sould not be an issue you know now a day we can talk to someone anywhere,from anywhere at anytime.for the problem solved 8/10 it took it took a week  still a little long but a lot better than last time, around a month.for the product i rate it 8/10 it run's great but there's still a problem with my update im gonna communicate with support later love safe pay it took a few minuts to understand and work's great.keep up the work to make everything even more userfrendlyas we dont all love computersGilbert"
Osama Abdel Rahman,1,5,"I was experienced  a problem with Bitdefender package  : I received a message that my computer at risk and I need to download a fresh version . I tried manytime to un install the old version but failed . I contacted the support team . Elena guided me how to un install and install a new version . Being not profisional and old man , I could not un install the old version inspite of several trials. I lost my timber and sent her several hard e mails . She was very patient and guided me step by step . Finally : I managed with her assistance to solve the problem : un install the old copy and install a new one and my PC gets protected . During this process , I discovered many interesting features in the Bitdefender package which I was never aware of before . Thanks  to Elena and to all support team"
Mark Lane,1,1,Thanks for deleting my files and not being able to restore the quarantined files that are not viruses!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Product sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
James Furey,1,5,"Over the years I have tried many of the security companies out there and then I found Bitdefender. This product is on another and far higher plane than any I have tried in the past. I have had no problems and feel fully protected while using my computer.Set on autopilot and worry no more. It is simply the best product on the market with a fantastic back up if you happen to have any query. I have recommended Bitdefender to all my family and friends and will continue to do so in the knowledge that if they purchase the product, they will be as satisfied as me."
Jan Muller,1,5,The best recommendation for this kind of program is that one never notices its presence on ones system and at the same time does not experience any malware. No malware program is perfect but bitdefender is very close to it.
Bob Skelly,1,5,Support fantastic no question too much trouble and quick reply.
Karen,1,5,"After having tried most every antivirus software on the market I found Bitdefender surpasses all of them.I originally bought the total security, but upgraded to the family plan when I found it covered every device my family owns, including Androids, iPhones, tablets, etc.BitDefender does more than any other antivirus software I used."
Sam Matthias Hayward-Vernon,2,5,"Works very well, isn't spec hungry like Norton/Mcafee and it works! It doesn't think it's a virus like AVG does itself. I goet a serial for 3 PC 1 Year for £9, Can't moan at that! Would recommend."
Robyn Oneile,1,5,"I've been using Bit Defender Antivirus for many years now and have watched it develop over time into a highly sophisticated and effective AV program. Queries and problems, although rare, are responded to promptly. The steps provided, whether by phone or email, have been straightforward and have always solved the issue, restoring the full functionality of my Windows 7 PC. My recent problem was caused by a 3rd party security solution (I didn't know I had it) running at the same time as BDF, and it came in with a Microsoft update on ""Patch Tuesday"" which is when the problem started. The BDF instructions were easy to follow and the issue rectified. I have recommended BDF to several friends over the past 3 years after being called in to disinfect their PCs from viruses & browser hijackers that their own (well-known!) AV programs failed to block, unlike the effective BDF. I really recommend any of the BDF software solutions."
Perine Pretorius,1,3,After my Kaspersky agreement ended I did what I do every year. Go online and find out what program is viewed as the current best program on the market. After reading several reviews it was clear that Bitdefender is the first choice of most for 2014. I proceeded to press the purchase button thinking I would be led the official site to purchase. During the purchase I noticed i was being led to a different site - it did not occur to me that this would be a third party seller . Since I never purchased from Bitdefender before I foolishly assumed that this is their particular method of selling. I am by no means a gullible user and kept checking that I am in fact buying the actual product. After using Bitdefender for a few days I felt convinced enough to change over my whole family. I just made contact with Bitdefender to find out how I can add more users and was told that IF I purchased from the Bitdefender website I would have had 2 extra users included in my original purchase price. Since I bought it from a third party seller I now only have a license for 1 user. I feel very foolish for not knowing this BUT I also feel cheated. I did the research and made the mistake thinking I would be led to the original website after reading a review. I have done this many times in the past and have always been led to the original website. I would respectfully request from third party sellers to do one of the following:A) Notify visitors that they are in fact making a purchase from a third party seller orB) Ensure that your buyer receives EXACTLY the same as other buyers that buy from the original companyI cannot help but feel cheated
Yevgeny,1,5,"I'm using Bit Defender for two years by now. And this was the best time of my computer life. Bit Defender is always compatible with anything I have in my computer, never interferes with anything coming into my computer. Always is in peace and harmony with all my computer games. In top of this I never even notice that I have Bit Defender in my System. But this is until I step into something dangerous. Only in this case the might of Bit Defender Security kicks in, and stops me from going any farther, and brings me back to safety. It gives me total protection. Folks, you may only dream of this kind of stuff if you don't have yet Bit Defender. So, rush to their store and buy one, because they may run out of stock one day.Besides has been said above, Bit Defender has excellent tech support. The Team replies to your query incredibly fast and solves the trouble you got in. I'm glad to be with Bit Defender."
Visvakarman Ishaya,1,5,Having just upgraded to windows 10 I had problems getting Bitdefender to run. Their support team was prompt and responded in 24 hours with correct information. I had Bitdefender reinstalled properly in a few hours. Microsoft was the culprit here and I praise the tech support team for their fast action.
Aaron Taze Deines,1,5,Best Anti Virus I have ever had!!
Mary Meyer,1,5,Recently had an issue where firefox's automatic update disabled my bitdefender.While trying to repair the issue my computer froze and I had to end the task which made it so bit defender could not be repaired.Contacted Bitdefender and the issue was handled very professionally. The representative was knowledgeable and sent me links for what I needed to get Bitdefender uninstalled and reinstalled again.The instructions were easy to follow as well.Bitdefender is a good internet security software to use and I will recommend it to everyone.
Michael Albert,4,5,"I tried Bitdefender after having problems with three other highly rated and popular Android A/V products.  One locked my phone 500 miles from home after I turned off airplane mode.  One provided support in terse, cryptic, generally unhelpful replies, and ultimately wouldn't even do that unless I upgraded to their latest version (which also would of course cost me more money), and one never worked correctly in spite of multiple contacts with their support staff.  Bitdefender provides an extremely understandable and easy to use interface, which is a relief after having to study web sites and manuals for other products to figure out what certain features and options actually did.  Their support is great.  I did have one problem that was resolved with their help.  It was nice to deal with people that that were polite, used complete sentences, and didn't think that terseness was next to godliness.  I'm happy after three failed attempts to find a product that is easy to use, works properly, and provides excellent support."
Rudy Bes,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition for several months after trying most other free antivirus programs. I have read several comparison reviews, and the Bitdefender antivirus engine scores equal to or better than the competition. Bitdefender has a real-time virus shield, and it automatically updates virus signatures several times a day. Bitdefender is the only antivirus program that automatically does both quick and deep scans. It also does a manual deep scan by right-clicking on the Bitdefender icon. I have contacted the Bitdefender Support Team on two occasions, and each time they were very cordial and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition to anyone who is looking for an antivirus program that is efficient and unobtrusive."
Anthony Hiram Alvarez,1,5,"As a fool, I ""updated"" my Java. Apparently there is this new malware/adware that completely messed up my computer. Conventional methods (safemode w networking) didn't work. had to remove the proxy setting on firefox and find a way to uninstall software (was an administrator, but said I had to be an admin. to remove??). Long story short, I had kaspersky, but it did not remove it. I used the trial version of bitdefender and it removed it. Anyone that got infected with what I did in May, use bitdefender! Was a Kaspersky Advocate for 5 years until this encounter. Although, I would like to add that my computer runs a lot smoother than it did with Kaspersky. Kaspersky did have it moments where my computer would freeze. I use my PC extensively and, since my purchase, I no longer experience these events."
ASR,2,5,"When we have to choose a product, there are many choice to make.  Generally, the competing products meet minimum requirements and vary from each other in certain features.  But one of the most important aspects of a particular product is customer support.  When we have a Bitdefender product, excellent customer support is always assured.  I have been a customer for many years and have always been pleased with the product and support as well. Great product + Excellent customer support = Satisfied and returning customers."
James,1,5,"I had selected Bitdefender after testing of several products from antivirus market leaders, and found that Bitdefender is most compact, fast, easy to use and transparent product.Safe box is also very interesting and useful feature (option like Safe box was also in previous antivirus product from another company, but it was a bit more complcated, so I didn't excercise it)."
Ralph Brien,1,5,"I am particularly happy with your persistence in settling a question. I am also happy that you scan flash drives. I think that one of those was responsible for the transfer of a trojan, perhaps three, to bootcamp on my iMac and MacBook Pro."
"Charles ""Ron"" Palardy",2,5,"One of the best security, virus, malware I've ever trusted on my PC, tablet, and cell. I know all of the info come basically from the same place but Bitdefenders GUI is the least intrusive and very easy to use."
Jeremy,1,5,"Bitdefender is a top-rated software that includes many protective services including internet security and anti-virus.  I have used the top ten Internet security products and would rate Bitdefender as #1.  My main concerns regarding Internet security software is competency of protection, run active protection perfectly without slowing down any resources on the computer, and the ability to customize the level of protection from ""autipilot mode""  all the way to ""paranoid mode"".   If you are a novice user than use autopilot mode to let Bitdefender accurately make the decisions for you about safe or unsafe activity.  If you are like me and prefer total control over ANY processes and applications which communicate over the internet than this is a perfect solution also.There are other great services that are included with Bitdefender that I do not use but would be valuable to the average consumer such as safe banking, safe web surfing, identity protection and coverage across all your digital devices.  Top-notch program, highly recommend."
Kelly Seitz,1,5,"Bitdefender provided me with one of the best customer service experiences I've had in a long time. The representative was super friendly and responded within a day of my sending a support ticket. He had obviously read my request, and unlike many support systems I've experienced, he responded to me personally, had a friendly tone, and sent me pertinent, helpful information and links that solved my problem immediately, instead of redirecting me to FAQ pages or giving overly general answers. I was extremely pleased, and had my Bitdefender interface updated and free of bugs within an hour! Very professional and wonderful service!"
MikeY,4,5,"This product is infinitely customizable to any home network situation but they could not possibly include all that in set up instructions without having tons of junk of little interest to the marketplace.  Therefore focused and attentive customer service is of utmost importance in walking you through ...learning to ""customize""  for your own setup. This they did with flying colors ...feeding me with incremental learning/teaching advice and instructions on trouble shooting and step by step re-introduction of the many MANY elements of a great Anti-virus and firewall program capable of detecting and stopping intrusions without slowing or invading home server or other operating system networked computers ...totally ...TOTALLY customized to your OWN individual home computer SYSTEM.  Making it bullet proof and seamless.  This product really delivers and the cornerstone of that is great and highly focused and intelligent customer service.  Don’t expect a phone call …you have to work through doing your part of the “trouble-shooting process” with the product by following highly INDIVIDUALIZED instructions …and that has to … HAS TO BE DONE via email written (step by step) instruction … it builds trust in Customer service .. and … AND … becoming  familiar with tweaking the product to your own needs …and keeping the nefarious bad guys at bay.   Buy it ...use it ...it IS THE BEST OF THE BEST !!! :-)"
Eric Brown,1,5,"I've tried several different types of antivirus/security suites, all of which let several known viruses lying around in my ""Development"" folder.  BitDefender was one of the only antivirus applications that actually picked the various strains of this virus up!  I would easily recommend BitDefender to anyone who needs real security tools"
Mark Baggs,1,5,"Bitdefender Total Security just works out of the box on laptops and even on a home server that shares a printer, file backup server and dlna server  no problems what so ever great software will continue to use it from now on it also covers my phone and tablet you bet all from one product you beauty love it."
SeanD,2,5,"I've used Bitdefender for a few years now, It picks up everything, It is quiet in the background, non intrusive and only warns when something is seriously wrong. It also has many other features. Worth every bit of your money 100 % and their backup help 24/7 is fantastic.. Sean D :-)"
Keshav Raj Aryal,1,5,"As far as I know Bitdefender is No.1 antivirus in the world. I have already used Avast, AVG, Avira, Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft Security Essential, Norton, Windows Defender and some online scanners - Eset, Malwarebytes and Trend Macro and seen for myself that they lack many features of Bitdefender. In my opinion,they are not comparable with Bitdefender.I will take this opportunity to draw your attention towards two things:Most of the people in Nepal are very poor and they don't have their income source in       US$ or any other convertible currency.Hence, I request you to keep your product prices lowest (to the extent possible) in Nepal and to do something so that Nepalese are able to download your product by using their visa card issued by banks in Nepal, if possible"
Edgar Usaga P.,1,5,It is non intrusive and very fast with an efficient technical assistance
Marty M. Montgomery,2,5,"I have used many other services and programs in the many years of my computer usage, and in years of Windows 301 and even before viruses were a threat.  Not only is it the easiest and friendliest to use, but it is also the most effective I have ever used. Although, no one program is ever quite thorough enough to catch everything, this one comes the closest to doing it all. My congratulations to its designers I love it. Keep going with the improvements and I'll continue buying it each year as long as it maintains the high standard it now holds."
Hector Barajas,6,5,"I've always used free AV and firewalls, also have used and tested several of them.Based on the TopTenReviews I decided to purchase Bitdefender Internet Security, I purchased it online at Herman Street with a huge discount!, then uninstalled my free AV and firewall (currently was Comodo Internet Security).Then installed Bitdefender Internet Security and I really get amazed with the easy and intuitive user interface, the program is very easy to understand, to use and to configure.Also it's very powerful against malware, viruses, spam, etc,Bitdefender's Photon Technology could be really noticed! with other AV & Firewall solutions my Windows 7 64 bit Dell Laptop was slower.  I really love this program!Bitdefender: keep on the great and outstanding work and I'll definitely renew with you!."
Lynette Reck Shumaker,1,3,"The program works great - the problem I have is trying to get help!  There is not a phone number that you can call.  They do have live chat but they cannot help me with my issue; which is:  I got an email from Bitdefender to renew my service at half the price.  Great!!  So I did that, then on my due date for my service, they charged my card again for twice the amount I already paid 4 days earlier.  I understand about the automatic renewal, but since I renewed (through their email), I assumed (yea my mistake) that it was renewing my service.  Long story short - I now have two license numbers but no service!  I got online Friday to find out I am now not covered!  I have two lisence numbers, $110 paid and no coverage.  I was able to ""borrow"" service for 16 days from a helpful gentleman in live chat.  Again, he could only pass my info on so someone could contact my by email.  That is not a very good way to fix my issue!!"
Matthew Ashley,1,5,"I bought bit-defender total security for our house hold computers 3 years running now. We have 2 laptops (1 is very old) and a powerful desktop, first none of us have ever experienced slow downs even on the old laptop. When we had norton a couple of years back all we had was problems and slowdowns it was awful.All you have to do is click auto pilot and let bit-defender do the rest its so easy.Of course  if you want more controll all the options are there. Not once have we had any virus or infection of any type.When i had problem with my purchase (wrong email) customer service helped me without any delay, they was helpful and polite and very professional.Also bit-defender has been no 1 protection for a couple of years now, voted by many review sites and I have to agree.What more can I say, brilliant company and a amazing product very happy customer.Matt"
rolliwolfi,1,5,"I have been using Bit-Defender for a few years on a number of different computers both professional and home and have as yet not encountered a problem that has not been solved very rapidly by their support team.I have tried, when buying a new computer (up to 4 per year) other anti virus programs during the initial free period one benefits from with a new purchase but have never liked what is offered. They are always extremely polite, 100% efficient and very friendly. Bit defender has always protected my computers against threats and any problems I have encountered have, with but one exception, been as a result of installing new programs on a computer or due to the computer it´s self. There are Computer makes and Anti Virus programs that I would strongly advise against and others I would recommend and use. Bit Defender, I would recommend and do recommend to anyone, novice, expert, home or business."
david_lawrie,3,3,"So I had a license, and wanted the best for my new Win 8.1. Would it install? Stuck at 67%. Bitdefender support didn't come up with anything, really, over about 3 weeks, and eventually stopped replying. Lots of time wasted. Gave up, uninstalled it, used Avast free and a firewall.A couple of months later, after installing a whole lot more programs, I had  a year's license free. Should try again?Carefully I created a disk image, uninstalled Avast, and would you believe it- Bitdefender installed first time."
Michael Woods,1,5,"Bitdefender is fast, secure and easy to use. Best Security for anyone from a home PC to a corporate network."
Bernie Lepper,1,5,"Twice I have called bitdefender help desk and both times they have been very helpful, curteous and back up what they say ..........in getting back to you. What more could you ask?Bitdefender client for 18 months"
Justin Croser,1,5,"The product is brilliant no hassles during set-up or everyday use. Their customer support is better than kaspersky easily who never get back to you.I've tried AVG, kaspersky, avast, and F-secure and none compare to this product. I'd highly recommend it to computer illiterate people and tech savvy people as well both autopilot for the illiterate and user mode for savvy people which has great depth.Experience: 5 yrs of IT network systems administration background"
Vic,1,5,"I've been very happy with Bitdefender as a product.The other side of the coin is how good is their service,I had a problem. I rang the support line. I'm in Australia and realise most support is now outsourced to other countries. Most of the time there truly is a problem with conveying the message whether it be due to quality of phone line or quality of understanding due to possibly cultural and of course language accents etc.I was most gratified with Bitdefender. No problem in line quality or understanding of problem. They helped me fix the problem very quickly.Technical service 24/7 is also a very good thing to have.Overall... no complaints and kudos to themVic"
Barry Stinson,2,5,"Bitdefender is an excellent program that delivers all that it promises, and if or when support is required, it is quickly and readily available.  Highly recommended!"
paul bunyard,1,5,bit defender uses so little memory . it is fast and I very much like the game mode and autopilot mode too.
"John Vine - 121 Boughtman Street Broken Hill,  NSW, 2880. Australia..  0428883159 Client",1,3,I received my bank statement today and I find you have charged me twice for Bit Defender 2014. The statement shows you charged me $119.95 on 25 March  2014 - and on March 27 there is another charge of $119.95...How could this be....If I am correct could you please foward any money that may be owing to me...
Patrick,1,3,"Fairly easy to use, pretty clear. Doesn't seem to interfere much with computer speed, however it failed to detect some malware/adware that got through. The malware appeared after I had used ""Malware bytes"" for the first time (which I read was supposed to be safe - I'm not so sure, now removed from my computer, don't trust). I contacted Bitdefender support who helped me get rid of the malware by directing me to a very good third party site but my only gripe is that Bitdefender support took over a week to reply to my enquiry. I used to have McAfee before installing Bitdefender, I was a bit unhappy with McAfee because it seemed to interfere with the computer speed but it never let any viruses or malware through. Apart from this bad experience Bitdefender has been OK. The customer support, once they got back to me, were very helpful and polite, they suggested that the malware had got through because I had ticked a box giving permisiion (un-knowingly because I hadn't read all the terms and conditions) for the adware to be installed on my computer. Anyway, ""all's well that ends well"", lesson learned ! Would I buy it again ? Not sure at this stage."
Martin Smith,5,5,"Been using another top-rated virus protection for last 12 months.  Recently had virus on system (programs not running, unable to access emails etc), but could not locate problem.  Tried unsuccessfully to contact support, but only access to FAQ's etc.  Solutions offered were way beyond my skill level (attaching 2nd comp as slave etc. etc), after many hours wasted; and as I was due to renew, I decided to try BitDefender.  I emailed support and explained problem prior to signing up for anything.  I had response next working day and, as suggested, downloaded 30 day trial version.  Ran check and virus was identified and cleaned along with about 40 other issues (I recognised where they had come from so know they were genuine).  Then ran free optimiser that came in software, which again found and cleaned many things I hadn't found.  All programmes now work fully again, and pc speed is back like new.  Customer service were incredibly helpful, and responded to emails within hours- not days. I don't compliment companies as a rule as it's their job to provide decent service, but BitDefender really went the extra mile and I am genuinely surprised and impressed.  One very happy customer here (maybe they should have me stuffed!)."
Bruce Campbell,2,4,I bought Bitdefender on the basis of its reviews as being very good at intercepting viruses and malware. I like the way it runs in the background. The Safepay browser is a bit clunky but it works. I found one annoying bug: if you use ampersands (&) in passwords sometimes the software records it correctly and sometimes it records it as  & and then if it pastes it in a website automatically the password will be wrong.Overall I am happy to be better protected after a nasty malware experience before I had it.
Herman Biesma,7,2,"We work already many years with BitDefender. A good prodcut! But.... They use Avangate as the company to send the bills etc. That company sucks! They have (together with BitDefender) a tricky way of ""automatic-renewals"". And if they take by mistake the wrong amount from your creditcard, they say that they can't help you: they say contact BitDefender. Not correct of course, because Avangate takes the money.But okay, it wouldn't be so bad, if BitDefender really HELPED in that situation. But they don't do that. They are sure that the customer made a mistake without taking the time to check what went wrong .So: it's a nice product, but when my subscription is expired, I will move to another product."
Mark Lucas,2,5,"I have been using Bitdefender Total Security 2014 for almost a month now, and am totally in agreement with their #1 rating for the last 3 years! They have saved me several times from viewing dangerous webpages, the Safe Pay function gives me access to purchases I would normally feel nervous about making because I never dealt with the company before. And I have received phenomenal responses from the customer care department when I screwed up and put another malware detection program on my computers that caused conflicts. This program truly covers ALL your needs for safe internet browsing!"
Fred,1,5,Have used Kaspersky fro many years but changed to Bitdefender after reading so many positive reviews. Bitdefender has turned out to be a first class product with first class customer service. I am not the most IT proficient and had a problem just after installation - Bitdefender Customer Services have been exceptional in assisting me to sort the issue - which by the way was not the product. If you want an exceptional product with a customer service to match Bitdefender is the way to go!
Diane Kasmiske Syens,1,5,"How wonderful to receive knowledgeable, friendly, prompt service in this day and age!!!  Very refreshing!  It could not have gone smoother and I definitely recommend Bitdefender!!"
Brian Ewart,1,5,"Since I have installed Bitdefender Total Protection I have experienced a trouble free PC experience with peer. It really is reassuring to know that this software lives up to it's well deserved reputation. I would willingly recommend it's use to anyone, and have installed it on other family members computers. I have also recommended it to many of my friends who have varying levels of computer competence.This is my third year of using Bitdefender, and until I encounter something better I have no reason to change. I am looking forward to an Ipad version to secure my portable access."
Roan Bester,1,5,"As a long time (>5 years) customer I've come to expect the best, and am getting it. Just installed/renewed for 2014 and it keeps on improving. This really is worth the money as you get the best antivirus anywhere (and I've tried the other favourites).Great UI and customer service (had a struggle with the downloader and got speedy assistance). I highly recommend them."
DAVID BROCKLEHURST,4,5,"If you are contemplating getting an anti virus software then in my opinion the bitdefenderwill take a lot of beating.There support online to solve a problem is first class and most cases they get back to you within 24hrs and instruct you in stages how to solve any issues you are having.I highly recommend this software and have used it for several years now to keep my 3 pc,s clear of virusues."
Russell Cairns,1,5,Bitdefender is a first class product.  It runs quietly in the background and I know I'm fully protected at all times.  When any issue arises the Support Group acts quickly and very efficiently.
Cal,1,5,To have a Bitdefender rep. comply to your needs in a professional and committed way only to complete the task at hand is a company I will stand by.
Jasper,1,4,"Bitdefender is the best antivirus I've used.It detects all virusses and it doesn't slow your pc down at all.However even for the best there's always place for improvement. The user interface can be buggy sometimes, and de-installation can be a pain if it's damaged for some reason. Luckily they have a nice uninstall tool. And besides, why would you ever have the need for uninstalling this great piece of software?"
Lee Reichel,3,5,"The software is solid as expected.  I downloaded  Bitdefender Antivirus and I could not install it.  After several failed efforts and an email a rep contacted me and wanted to clear up some issues on my pc.  I was reluctant to let someone just take over my computer remotely.  Finally I talked with the tech assigned to fix my machine.  He spent nearly 2 hours trying and did clear out some unwanted programs(unwanted search programs) but Bitdefender would still  not install.  I was told there was a five day guarantee on getting the program to run.  I called the company and asked for a refund and they were very courteous and refunded the money to my credit card immediately.  A few minutes after my call another tech called me and asked if she could take a stab at it.  I was reluctant and told her that other tech spent a good deal of time trying and was unsuccessful.  I finally let her try and watched her manipulate my computer remotely and in less than 10 minutes she solved the problem and Bitdefender installed without a hitch. I was amazed and told her.  She was very polite and told me I was all set.  All the people I dealt with were very knowledgeable and courteous.  That has not been my experience with other vendors.  They seemed genuinely concerned that my pc be protected.  I have been involved with computers since 1974 from mainframes to pcs and even Atari but I learned a lot from them.  First rate company!  (In case you are wondering what the problem was it was simply something in my user profile, so creating another admin user quickly solved the problem)"
Jakob Friis Hansen,12,2,"I purchased a Bitdefender security product for over a year ago to my windows computer.Since I have changed to a mac computer.I just discovered that Bitdefender have made a auto renewal of my license and charged the payment though Paypal, without my active accept.I have tried to email Bitdefender about the problem, but they refuse to make sure the payment i paid back.So be very carefully if you choose to buy a license at Bitdefender.Suddenly I got an email from Bitdefender that they would return the payment anyway. So they get a star more for that."
John O'Kelly,1,5,I was impressed with the support as usually product providers try to avoid you. I would recommend  Bit Defender to anybody.
Heidi Ross,1,5,"I've been happily using Bitdefender for a few years now, and last time I went to renew it, something misfired with the links so that the price kept changing (going up) at each new page! I cancelled the process and emailed Bitdefender with the issue, expecting to get into one of those frustrating chains where I have to explain myself repeatedly and follow more fruitless links that 'might' solve my problem before bothering a real person with it -- you know the kind -- but instead I got one simple acknowledgement email with one new link, which  worked first time and gave me a great price. It was such a relief and really helped me get back to business uninterrupted, just as the product itself does, operating fuss-free in the background."
Randy Derewenko,1,5,"Well, I have tried many anti-virus and security programs but have finally found the one I like best to date. It is not intrusive as I thought it might be and works silently in the background. I do not believe it is a resource hog at all, while my previous product was. I think you'll be glad you chose Bitdefender, truly a great product. Customer service is second to none. Bravo."
Brian G,2,5,"I had a problem with BD Autopilot and virus scanner turning off when I opened the BD Control Panel from a laptop restart. I contacted Support and they sent me a procedure to install their diagnostic tool which produces a log which they analysed and identified potential conflicts. They then emailed step by step instructions and links which involved uninstalling BD using their too, and removing the Malware app, and reinstalling BD from their link. Problem solved."
Ron,2,5,"Having read good reviews on Bitdefender, I decided to try it, and installed the free version first. There were a few minor problems that the support team rapidly responded to. Everything is now functioning correctly. This is the least obtrusive anti-virus programme that I have yet come across.  It runs quietly in the background with no noticeable adverse effect on the computer's operation, no nag screens etc. with an incredibly simple interface and if it's virus blocking engine is as good as the experts claim it to be, this must rank as one of the best anti-virus programmes available."
pkzaerum,1,4,In the beginning I thought. Let's try it. Slower as McAffee it probably will not be. I hope it continues to work as it does now.
John,1,5,"I had a problem with the installation of the Bitdefender ‘free edition’. It ended up being because of a missing dll file on my computer.I supplied the relevant information to the support team expecting them to come back with a vague dismissive response. Instead they actually tried to solve the problem! The supplied all the relevant information on what files I would need to install and links to any Microsoft products that I might need.As it happens I had solved the issues myself, but I am very impressed with the backup support that Bitdefender had available to me."
RK Wright,1,5,"Having bought and am using quite a number of software over the past 30+ years, I've found the BitDefender ""customer support astonishingly prompt, clear, concise & complete"" (only one other software company has given me such splendid service).BTW as a senior citizen, I esp. appreciate the replies in ""PLAIN ENGLISH"" instead of ""technical jargon"", etc. I'm now a very happy customer with BitDefender running on my PC and my dear wife's (courtesy of BitDefender which came as a real surprise).Looks like I can now ""sleep and work better plus safer"" with BitDefender"
Morfo2,2,5,It's the best anti-virus of all and everyone know it.The support is amazing too.
Ben Rankin,1,5,I bought Bitdefender TS 2013 and have never been happier with my antivirus and firewall solution. I have recommended this software to my friends and family. This solution is both powerful and highly customisable. The most important feature of this software is that it doesn't treat you like an idiot. It will give you clear information and let you decided what you think is best.
rassem,1,5,"i always had answer if i had issue with the software, or i dont know what to do.it is great to know they gonna help."
Gorilla47,1,5,"OK- I admit that I was a big Kaspersky fan; that is, until I wanted to upgrade.  The new product would not install the new Kaspersky AV program.  I even tried to remove the Registry files using the Russian Reg. remover...customer support was BAD.  I got Bitdefender Internet Security 2014 but it would not install either due to Kaspersky files embedded somewhere.  Bitdefender support worked with me for four weeks (with time lags) but never gave up and finally we removed all Kaspersky files and installed Bitdefender without any further issues.  The program is amazing and I really like it very much, especially knowing that customer service will help me out anytime."
Mike Danick,2,5,"Been using Bitdefender almost 10yrs now and havent regretted it one bit.  I think i only had to contact customer service once in those 10yrs and that was recently only regarding license support and download support.  i have never had any issues technically i couldnt resolve myself.after getting my license issue straightened out, i had licenses that hadnt been activated over the last few years and its been fixed to my satisification by combining my unused licenses into one current one and that gave me over 1800 days till my current license expires.i will update my BitDefender products every year as i have done and have no plans to change products.  thanks to BitDefender for the excellent product and service!Mike Danick"
Jo Robson,1,5,The support is second to none and easily accessible by online chat or phone. This backs up the great product. Well done Bitdefender.
Raejinfury,2,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for 5+years now, and it continues to  shine way above any other AV on the market.(have tried all the others in the past, through 25 years of PC's)It is used to cover all 5 PC's in the household, and we have had NO problems throughout that time, no need to re-install, no need to check on it, no worries that were not protected, and nothing getting anywhere close to infecting anything, as that is what Bitdefender does so remarkably well, you don't even know its doing anything, and you still stay 100% protected, with absolutely no hassle.Customer Services is amazing too - which really strengthens this amazing product. All-in-all everyone should be using this product, and when you do, you will wonder why other companies cannot run a piece of software and a business like this, as they make it look so easy!"
Susannah Washington,3,5,"I have never used bitdefender before but I am very impressed with the product. I have used the other competitors products but have been very dissapointed not only in the products but in the customer service. the safepay is fantastic and having had reason to contact the customer service team, they were prompt, and gave clear and concise instructions which solved my problem.I would definitely recommend this product."
Djalal Siko,1,5,"The internet security is fast without using much resources in the computer and very reliable, they have excellent customer service and iam so glad that i use this One :)"
Felipe Zapata,1,5,"Bitdefender does the job, and it does it without getting in your face. Lots of goodies included that are easy to understand, disable if you wish, enable if you change your mind. If a problem does crop up, they react in a timely manner and get it solved. I've had other antivirus programs, and this is the best by far."
Omid,4,5,"The internet security is fast without using much resources in the computer and very reliable,  they have excellent  customer service as well."
Damian O'Donohue,1,4,"I have been a loyal customer with BitDefender for many years now. This is because I like the product. But the one aspect of the product that I really do not like is the RENEWAL SERVICE.I recently allowed my subscription to AUTO RENEW last week, April 2014. I was charged the full 70 Euro for Total Security packageEven though, at the time of my renewal, there was an offer to buy the same package for 24.95 Euro.How is this right? I think as a loyal customer I should be allowed an auto renewal price instead of saying the full amountI also had a problem last year when it came to renewing my subscription. About one month before my subscription was due to expire I received an email with an EARLY RENEWAL OFFER.I followed this link and updated my serviceHowever, I received notice that my subscription was about to expire. I ignored this email. I was then charged AGAIN via the AUTO RENEWAL SERVICE. Bitdefender charged me TWICE for the same service. They had TWO DIFFERENT licences for the same email address. This took numerous emails and time to try and post this issue outThe renewal service is poor and misleading and needs to be more transparent.There are so many DIFFERENT PRICES available at the same time it is unfair and unacceptable. I am disappointed with this service there days and will have to seriously reconsider my subscription in future."
w,1,5,"Hello, First a note of critics > why not in Dutch? its to anywane to read, write and understand English. When i have a email from you its written in French > sorry, but in Belgium (and the Netherlands).Is it not possible to send info in Dutch? And now my revieuw, well short Bitdefender is a very good and realible shepard for your PC ( is it not possible to place a button, when the scan is over > the pc shutdown. for the rest, good job, i feel my safe in the world weird web.Best Regards, Walter"
J. Hertzog,1,5,Excellent services & caring company for their customers!  I 've been with this company for years.  They take time to listen & correct any problems. thankyoufor a great company!                                  J. Hertzog
Ali Ahmad,1,5,You are the best
Martha Johns,1,5,"I had bought an antivirus from Bitdefender some years ago, because my husband had researched and Bitdefender was supposed to be the best.  It had always served the purpose well over the years without upgrading to the Total Protection package. Until last week! Some really big bad infection got into my computer and my husband's computer, and really messed them up! I contacted Bitdefender first online, and chatted with a representative, who tried to guide me in disinfecting. However the ""bug"" saw what I was doing, and shut down my internet contact with Bitdefender. Being unable to contact them that way, I found a phone number and called Bitdefender. A representative patiently tried to  coach me through the process of disinfection. Finally it became obvious that this was not working, and that an infection specialist needed to take control of the computer in order to disinfect it. In order for that to be done, It required that I upgrade to the Total Protection package. But since both computers were essentially useless as they were, it was certainly worth the price to get them fixed!!! Once the required connection was made, (which took some time, because the ""bug"" kept blocking the process) all I had to do was sit there in front of the screen and watch the specialist work! Occasionally she would call me on the phone to ask me to do something, but after a couple of hours she had disinfected and optimized both computers. And both computers are covered by this service, any time I need it, for the next two years! I am so very pleased!  With ""malware"" becoming more and more sophisticated all the time, I really would not be without this service again, if I can help it!  Thank you, Bitdefender!"
Arn,1,5,"I have been using bitdefender for 2 years now and have not experienced any problems.Bitdefender uses very little system Resources and makes my computers boot up fast compared to other AV i did try before i landed on bitdefender.About threats-i have not had any problems at all,and i have checked regulary With a well known malware program that is highly rated,that program did not find even tracking cookies after bitdefender has scanned my computer so i trust bitdefender 100 % .I am a normal user,not surfing in illegal sites,but bitdefender are effective if i stumble into a site and BF Blocks that site if there are malware or other threaths on that site.I feel safe when having bitdefender on my computers,when using payment solutions like paypal,bank etc.In total Security you get some more options that isnt there in internet Security like the tuneup where you can defrag Your computer,remove temp files etc etc.you also have the parental Control,wallet etc wich all are good Tools both for the children and Your selfe as a parent.All in all my computers run smoot With bitdefender and i have never looked back to the other AV solutions out there even if they might be effective as well-but whats that main thing for me is to have an AV solution that runs smooth like BF does, and when i use my computer i dont have to be worried or have to solve problems With my bitdefender total Security.Bitdefender takes care of Your Windows update,your other apps,your drivers for your hardware etc..so you dont have to look around the Whole www. to find what you need.About customer service--they are very effective if you have a problem or a question,you will get help very fast.I will use bitdefender and i will recommend bitdefender to everybody that asks me,cause i feel this is the best AV out there..just look at all the awards,tests in Magazines,websites and you see what AV solution that every time thrones on the top of that list..Bitdefender! I know that there are illegal registration keys around on the net-but why not pay a few bucks for very good AV solution instead of using that keys,the best thing is to be honest and not do anything criminal.Buy a key legal and you will feel better with your selfe!Arn in Norway- a happy Bitdefender user :)"
Ron,1,4,"Bitdefender is a good antivirus remover, but I don't think my protection against malware is complete without also using a good malware detection service such as ""Malwarebytes"".   They detect and remove malware that Bitdefender apparently doesn't detect."
Amit Malhotra,1,5,"Hi,I have been using this antivirus for more than an year and I must say that it works and protects your Computer like no other antivirus in the current market does.It has AutoPilot mode that really would not want You to take any action. It does it by itself seamlessly. Taking Right decision every time it catches a threat. Far by most the best Anti-Virus.Hats Off to developers and A must have application for all Windows OS Users.Regards,Amit Malhotra"
826242220,1,5,"Bitdefender Internet Security has been a great program and I have been using it for the last 4 or 5 years. I have bought and used McAfee, Kaspersky, and others to mention a few. Bitdefender Internet Security has never let me down. Based on past experience I have bought and am installing the latest version and I anticipate the same great results as with previous editions. In other words it don't get any better. So if you are looking for peace of mind go with the best and rest in peace that your computers is fully covered."
Nenj,1,5,"Recently had a problem with my Bitdefender key, contacted their support & the problem was resolved very quickly & efficiently."
আবির আহমেদ,1,5,"I am a Bit-Defender Customer for almost 3 years now. And I can say only one thing about them. They provide the most secure, comfortable and 100% reliable Antivirus service. I never had any kind of tension regarding my computer with virus. Bit-Defender is like a parent to my computer. Bit-Defender take care of my computer like a mother take care of her child. I really appreciate Bit-Defender's Antivirus Services. Go Ahead Bit-Defender. You will be #1 for 2015 too :).Thanks with regardsAbir AhmedEmail: moztabaahmedabir@gmail.com"
John Stockdale,1,5,I almost wanted to give up on PC's until I tried Bitdefender Total Security. It makes my system run better than any apple!!
Anis Inajit,1,5,"I started using Bitdefender when I was 16. Now 21, and it's much clearer transferring files, games, and 'non-necessaries' among peers were part of friendship. And I never stop changing anti-viruses and formatting my hard disk for a fresh start. But after I got on board, it seems I'm now rather happy to be scanning friends and strangers USBs for 💀👽💩👹s, surf the web like it's my father's, and it's autopilot makes it even more silent as if I've got no defender.It only hurts some people don't know about it. And if it's name doesn't ting something in you, maybe you should google for best antivirus from notable sites like AV-Test, PC Mag and others. Since I followed, I know it's taken best in 2012, 2013 and another I'm January 2014. I don't wanna talk about past few years cos I don't wanna build my answers on guesses, though I know it was second to none lol.If you want one security software that you get what you pay for and that you will never uninstall after really understanding and optimizing it's settings based on use, and regularly updating it, (which is pretty normal for any software), then there is none other than anything from BITDEFENDER."
Joseph,1,5,"I do my research and shop around. Bitdefender has the most protection I have found for the best price I could find. I've had only one problem, but it was fixed in about 36 hours. I merely asked a question and the representative replied almost immediately with the most personal care I have ever experienced; especially from an Internet company providing Antivirus services. I am extremely pleased with this software and I would recommend it to everyone. And, as Bitdefender says, thank you for your time."
MIKY,1,5,I have used BitDefender  for over eight years with complete satisfaction.  As a computer instructor I hear from my students a variety of complaints regarding other virus programs.  I have never had a student that was unhappy after having them switch to BitDefender
Bruce,1,5,"Point for point and feature for feature Bitdefender is the best value for money. The support team are true to their word and respond quickly and efficiently to queries. I have found the team helpful, considerate and courteous. The ability to upgrade product is painless and easy to accomplish. Bitdefender deserves its global position of number one ."
Larry Gallagher,1,5,I had a problem that was beyond my understanding and the Bit Defender agent was supremely confident he could help me and he did within a very short time.The problem was solved very clearly and efficiently.
Evan Marlowe,1,5,"Really excellent Customer service, especially the live chat online. It's just spectacular. Extremely polite, always greet with ""Hello, how are you today?"". Never push you to purchase anything. Just wow, some of the best customer support I've ever seen. I had a possibly malicious file I wanted them to examine, they sent me and email and checked it out. I cannot say their product is the best in the market, but it is definetly up there. And bundle that and the spectacular customer service with them being able to manually remove malware from your computer over a secure internet connection. Reccommend this to anyone."
Gert Larsen,9,5,Bitdefender is absolutely the best security program for me. Also they have an excellent service solving issues which have occurred for example when my pc was restored to factory settings.
אביב ששה סוכן ביטוח,1,5,This Antivirus is great! No slowdowns! never had problem in the last 4 years. custumer support very helpful! keeps me calm!thank you bitdefender
Jeshwanth Rahul,1,5,"I would surely recomend it to anyone and everyone. The best anti virus I've ever used. Light, doesn't eat up the processor or RAM and effective. In auto pilot mode it does the best."
Ashish Agrawal,1,4,"The security features in Bitdefender Antivirus Plus is very goodPros:Auto pilot is amazing, u dont have to take care of any thingSafepay is also a good feature for those who uses net banking and allInternet security is extremely good for regular internet users1 year security free for mobileCons:Dont have an option to turn off security monitoring for 15 mins or 1 hour as some other antivirus do..It doesnot quit from task manager, even if u want to for any casesometime the green tick mark in each link in browsers are annoying"
George Melendez Correa,1,5,"This is what I responded to Bitdefender's support team and Daniel.....""Hi Daniel.....Thanks for such a quick reply concerning my issue and you have addressed it  superbly and right to the point. I did have my Wins Firewall disabled so I will follow your suggestion and use it with Bitdefender's Firewall. My concern was that after installing Bitdefender my boot time, browsing and opening programs and applications was really slow. I first thought that it had to do with the firewall but after a few days all is working just fine. I assume that it has to do with Bitdefender's learning process or something like that. My boot time is back to normal with only a few seconds (4 ) added so that's not a issue. I am pleased with your software and it's so easy to understand that even I (am not a techy or geek) can set it up. The default settings are excellent so there's really no need for that. It's more or less like a ""install and forget-it"" and let it do it's job.... Wonderful ....thanks for your concern and valuable info.....George MelendezPuerto Rico""Well thank you so much and may I say that you have surprised me with the excellent support and really fast reply. You have a client for life....Keep up the GOOD WORK..."
Zoran,2,5,For years I use Bitdefender Internet Security and have never had any problems with viruses and now I'm very satisfied with and Mobile Security for Android Simply insert the Block Call and SMS. A lot of success in your work and greetings from Serbia!
Ehsan Mrt,1,5,"I've used many anti viruses and internet security systems. Bitdefender is the best I've come across. It has the smallest impact on my computer's performance and at the same time, I feel that my computer is secure.I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for the best."
David Benoit Charles Verschueren,1,5,"I had a big virus problem and they didn't just say try this try that, instead they showed me things to find and track hidden files that most people wouldn't even think of but I did however this still didn't fix my problem so, then they showed me to do something els and poof virus is gone...I've tried everything to get ride of it, remove hdd scan on another system with kasper sky even that didn't fix it...I can't be more proud of bitdefenders staff teaching people to insure safety so, I for one am sold for life bitdefender is two thumps up... Cheers XD"
Peter Dykes,4,5,"I've been using BD Internet Security for several years and have no complaints whatsoever. My computers have never been infected in any way during that time, despite several attempted attacks and any queries I have had have been dealt with quickly and to my satisfaction. Bitdefender IS is an excellent product with great customer support. What more can I say?"
Chris Brown,1,5,"In the almost 4 plus years that I have purchased and used Bitdefender products on my three computers, whenever I have needed Customer Support or Technical Support they have always been there for me and solved the problem in a very courteous and professional way. I would very much recommend their products to everyone."
F.M.H.Fallah,7,5,I am happy to have installed BitDefender Total Security on my computer.It is perfect decision taken by me.All that I have said is without any prejudice
Peter Huteson,7,4,Found this new (to me) internet virus and keep all safe Bitdefender programme easy to set up soon learns what you need to remember great just what I wanted runs in the background with no slowdown. I only had 1 problem after I had upgraded the two computers but that was soon sorted with tec help after a misreading on the email response and more or should I say easily understood follow up email.  The auto pilot setting is great just the way I want with simple reports this what I've done and what I did with it.
BVN,1,5,"In the early stage I have used Bit Defender Total Security before 3 years in my home. It was a trial version. At that time, I had a wonderful experience. At that time, I was not fully aware about the internet viruses activities. So I didn't care about antiviruses. I tried some free antiviruses of AVG, Avast, McAfee, etc. After that Bit Defender were changed its appearance and I also tried that but I found some slow in my windows xp where I didn't have high ram, processor etc. So I used Kaspersky Internet Security, it was worked fine. I noticed that in my pendrives, there is a file named ""autorun.inf"", which was not showed earlier. Bit Defender is not detecting it as any virus. Anyway nice software which defends from the viruses. Thanks................."
Adrian,1,5,"I believe that Bitdefender is the best antivirus protection suite among others, that is why I never hesitated and think twice on what to choose for my needs.It is light on the system and never burdens or impede the speed of my computer which is very important. You won't even notice it running on the background and it also has a very friendly user interface. What's more is that it eventually adapts to your computer.I actually visited a couple of shops in my area to search and buy Bitdefender but kept on offering other brands but I insisted buying Bitdefender and the merchandiser finally told me that they are trying to dispose other brands since its on the shelf for months.Bitdefender is the no. 1 antivirus program, a real value for money."
Vladimir,1,5,"I use bitdefender products for many years. I am very pleased with the work Bitdefender programs.Service is the best. Always, there is a lot of special offers. I am very satisfied!"
Rohugh Bear,1,5,I have used Bitdefender Total Security for some time now and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for the ultimate antivirus security program.Thank you Bitdefender.
Steven Purdy,5,5,"Bitdefender found some viruses and a Trojan that snuck past Trend Micro Titanium! It had a hiccup this morning - the on-access scan would not load. I got a relatively quick response from Bitdefender altho I do not have the 'paid extra support', ran the included fix program, and all is well. Super easy, and I also feel better protected."
Jode Emm,1,5,"I've been with Bitdefender for a few years. There's been a couple of issues in that time and they've been resolved without too much angst. I recently trialled Norton 360 and although they have some good features over Bitdefender like monitoring performance etc, it was slow on my laptop.  Back to Bitdefender and happy with performance and keeping my system safe."
Benjamin Sturm,25,5,Det spiller bare 110%Keep up the good work!
Frantz Felk,31,5,"""Sold"" Bitdefender Total Security to our friend."
John Carter,4,4,"It took a while, but eventually a bitdefender agent sorted my problem out after SEVERAL msgs backwards and forwards. Offered me an EXTENSION to my license key for my troubles, which i thought was very good of them. All-in-all, a good result, and i will continue to use there service. :):):):):)"
Michel Fizzano,1,5,"Simply put, this software really delivers the goods! I have been with Bitdefender for over 5 years now, and I can say that nothing passes through it's guard without being noticed. And when something is detected on your computer, it is immediately quarantined and notified to you, so that you can decide what action to take further,  when and if you want it. And believe me, as I am working in the Show Business industry and constantly travelling all around the world, I am being exposed to a lot of threats coming from different Wi-Fi networks, trusted or even untrusted ones, Bitdefender intercepts anything that comes through! Why? Because it has an automatic engine that keeps updating itself to intercept new viruses wherever you go. Furthermore, the software is simple and easy to use, and it is not too heavy on your CPU. It runs smoothly in the background while you are working.  And best of all (and that is important for me), if or when you have a problem with the software, just contact the Bit Defender support team: you will get a professional solution to your problem in the next 24 hours, and they will follow up on you until the problem is solved. And even better: the support is FREE! No bullshit answers (like I had with other products) in the form of: 'Your product is out of warranty; we can provide you with support for a small fee of....' So I would certainly recommend this product if you want to surf with peace of mind..."
Jerome Kammermeyer,2,5,"If I run into any problem all I have to do is contact Bit Defender! In there response you will have a cure! Or they will call you and solve your problem, Personally! You just can't expect that service from anyone else! Period!! I trust and spread the word to every person I see. I have paid so much money for services, just trying to get help is a joke. Since I got Bit Defender all my worries are gone for ounce in my LIFE!!!   JFK"
Richard Haynes,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for sometimes now and I would not use any other security package on my PC. The support service is first class, quick and detailed response to any quarry."
rober,2,4,"I used Bitdefender Total Security 2013 & recently upgraded to the 2014 version. That was over one week ago and yet I still get e-mail messages telling me to upgrade because by 2014 version has expired.Uses few resources during even system scans, which is very welcome. Scans do seem to take a long time though, at least as long as other such programs.SafePlay does not work for me. If I use it when accessing financial sites it either allows me to complete one transaction only before logging me out of the bank site, OR, when I try to log in, it causes my system to crash. Doesn't seem to matter which browser I am using.Other than that, I am happy with the program"
Charles Howard,1,5,I have had no problems other than a their was a virus that had to be remover with other software. This was cauht by bitdefender. It ended up working out for the best because I did not have to reload all my software.
Deydier,1,5,This is just the best antivirus for windows and mac...The after sale services are wonderful too...I deeply recomend it !
Rona Hany,1,4,must be more restrictive like firewall and malware
Eesyam Ridzwan,1,5,"At first I was hesitating to use this product because almost non of my friend have ever heard of their name, much less use their product. After obtaining it I was very satisfied with the product I purchased (BitDefender Antivirus Plus 2014). The interface was so simple that even a computer noob like me was having no difficulty at all to use it.Once, my internal hard drive went defective and I had to change the whole hard drive on my laptop. That means losing ALL my precious data (NOOOO!!!), including the apps. I contacted their customer service to help me with my problem (cause I seriously need an antivirus for my renewed laptop) and I was hesitating because I was afraid that it would actually went void just like that (cause from what I heard in the past these fraud cases actually happens quite a lot). And within few hours I had successfully reinstall the software. I was very pleased with the product and the service.The fact that I took my time to write a long ass review (not that many people will take their time to read though) is proof enough that I am very pleased with this company and their services and I would definitely HIGHLY recommend it to anyone."
Pierre-André Regamey,1,4,An issue when installing  Bitdefender was quickly resolved after the first email back from the support team.  Great!  Steps were simple to follow and now my recalcitrant  laptop is protected.
Mikel Davis,1,3,"I'm pretty sure I will go back to Norton after this year, when my script is up. Don't get me wrong I do believe it works great its just not for me. There customer service is good when you can contact them. Thank you BitDefender. Other problem was email like never showed up in system also."
Linda Kinnear,4,5,I purchased this almost a year ago & it has been a fantastic internet security. Little seems to escape it's beady little defender qualities. Polite & prompt replies to any problems you may encounter.Highly recommended.Satisfied Bitdefender customer.March 2014
liz hemingway,6,5,"Bitdefender was recommended to me by my Computer support guy. I was a little dubious, as it wasn't a name I had heard of. My computer guy is very knowledgeable  and I went with his choice,as my Mac had been attacked. I cannot speak highly enough of Bitdefender, I have peace of mind and feel well protected. I have recommended it to friends with a Mac and they are pleased with the protection Bitdefender gives them. I would recommend it again."
Christ Burnt,1,5,"If you want to surf the net with peace of mind, Bitdefender is key. Worried about about downloading suspicious updates or accessing specific websites, Bitdefender will block malicious sites from accessing your info."
Daniel Serna,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender since the early days when nobody even knew the product existed for one reason - I prefer anti-virus software that works and a good product no matter how much of an ""under-dog"" it may be will eventually lose its ""under-dog"" status.  The phrase ""From Prey to Predator"" comes to mind.  I often have a difficult time communicating over email/chat and the Bitdefender support team made it very clear they understood my requests for help."
Betty,1,5,"I have Bitdefender Total Security. and have not had any problems, with my computer, since installing it."
Srinivas Naidu Vegi,1,5,some time it show our valied key  shows as invalied keys
Abhishek Gautam,1,4,"total security, it scaned 5 torzans and 2 worms and many viruses rescued me from my pc, thanx to Bitdefender, saved my life almostyeah i gave 4 stars coz nobdy is 100%perfect. but belive me this av is worthy 4.999999 stars."
Robert Bishop,1,5,"I saw an ad on a Staples site for two years of the New Total Bitdefender for $39.95 and decided to try out the deal.  After talking with customer service, I had over 900 days of service (I can't seem to pull up the number right now).  I have  worked with them in the past on removing viruses like ""FBI Ransomeware"" and on their helping me tune up my machine which is a custom computer, and have had courteous success every time.  I actually look forward to calling them now.  It's always a positive experience, and, so far anyway, they have cured everyone of my situations.  I am a great fan of Bitdefender."
Ruaraidh,1,5,Simple to use and easier to set up. Runs really well and had no issues with it.Would recommend it to anyone!
Ray Jack,16,1,"I bought Bitdefender at the end of January, I had them install it for me online so I wouldnt have any problems, on the first day it was very good faster than kaspersky, but after that it just got worse and worse, nowif i can get access to the internet it takes at least 5 mins to open an email, and then it freezes, I have sent them 6 messages on their contact us method on the program and I now have 5 of their files on my desktop but nothing from them at all, making my computer useless, their customer service is crap, and i suspect that they got to be number 1 by bribing the magazines, other people on here who say they are good must be being paid by them or ar employees of the company. My warning as posted on Twitter and Facebook is dont buy it"
JOSE LUIS MELO,1,5,I fully recommend Bitdefender as a company that creates excellent solutions and takes proper care of its customers.
Tri Van,1,4,"I have no experience in using other antivirus software, but i used BitDefender and feel happy & satisfied with its operation. I feel peace in mind. I like the good support provided by BitDefender, and would recommend this software to my friends,,"
Xu Eddie,1,5,With Bitdefender Ijust feel as if no malware nor virus has ever existed!
Jim Houston,5,5,The chat line is really very good at solving problems when they arise which is not very often. I'm more than happy with Bitdefender and the service they provide
Aleksandar,1,5,"i previous used Kaspersky and i used to pay too much. Now i have excellent service and quality for much less than Kaspersky. I am worry free about viruses, all staff of BitDefender is polite and helpful and i can enjoy the benefits of Internet without any problem. I am happy now and my computer works smoothly."
Bruno,7,5,"BitDefender Security Suite 2014 works great on my four desktop PC's, although it requires 'some' additional computer skill to fully utilise the benefits.That's why I emailed the Service Desk several times.My experience: Fast, reliable, accurate and friendly support!!One deals with persons, not a vague 'answering service'.BitDefender Team, keep up the good work!!Best regards from 'Holland',Bruno"
Frank Herlihy,3,5,"My experience with the product - The Box - and customer service is, was and it is anticipated to be very good."
Lynne F Evans,1,5,I have tried a few antivirus solutions in the past - and I have to admit that I have had computers crippled by virus attacks. But after switching over to Bitdefender over 5 years ago - I had never had any problems ! I have always subscribed to the Total Security products and tell everyone there is NO excuse not to have a good antivirus these days - and the Family Pack is an affordable  and essential asset for home users too.
Sebastian Kriza,1,5,"It's easy to use, does not use more resources (RAM), and it does its job very well. I recommend to all"
Joseph Kofi,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender internet security for the past four years after a careful research and consideration from a host of Anti-Virus vendors. I can say for sure that I have made the right decision. I never regreted chosing bitdefender. It is worth the cost. I have been recommending and will continue to recommend Bitdefender to anyone who wants anti-Virus protection. The software is easy to use and provides solid protection. Bitdefender is good for you, why don't you give it a try."
Tinashe Chimene,1,5,With Bitdefender Ijust feel as if no malware nor virus has ever existed! I enjoy maximum protection!!!!!
"Alan Hotchkiss, Salisbury",10,5,"I had difficulty with registration of my Internet Security software but, first by email then by online chat, my problem with the License Key Code was resolved. (The team, very politely, pointed out that I had tried to use some numerics instead of letters - silly me!)"
Robert M Fomby,1,5,"I messed something up while using Bitdefender and contacted their support team.  They responded very quickly, but i am just too dumb about computers to do what they first suggested.  (I'm in my early 60's and this tech wave has just washed over me!)  I re-contacted them and they again responded very quickly.  I was able to follow their very simple instructions and got my problem solved without a hitch.  Very good service and made me feel very comfortable, not at all like the idiot I first felt!!!"
Jeroen van Duijl,4,4,It's a good antivirusprogram with possibility to easily adjust settings.  I had need of assistence when bitdefender didn't start due to Windows trouble and received adequate and fast help.
Mridu Harsh,3,5,"But, there are bugs which I think, they'll improve if you share your experiences with their Customer Care Support.Hats off, to BitDefender's Heuristic Technology."
Janet A Smart,1,5,"I am extremely satisfied with the product.  It is simple to use and doesn't come with a lot of extra baggage.  I recently had a problem with Bitdefender that I attributed to a recent Windows update.  I read the ""help me's"" and was concerned about dealing with techs who would be way over my head. My email was promptly answered and a solution provided with step by step simple clear and concise instructions  The best part was the follow up after the resolution.  A really great company to work with who deserve all the stars available."
Hamza Hassan,1,5,very reliablegreat quality good response teamextremely securegreat for banking
Igor Antolović,2,5,All Bitdefender software have good price and great quality.
Derrick Timms,9,5,"I'm not a computer person, but I have found Bit Defender does what it says.Any small problems I have had have been quickly resolved by the service team.The only thing I would say is that I would prefer a UK based service team, as I am not very good with accents."
gy62tww123,2,5,"Over the years I have used many computers in different places with different, so called, anti-virus software. Most providers, not all, were difficult to communicate with: also their products were not good at their ""job"" that I had paid for.I was introduced to BitDefender in its early days and have used nothing else since. Why? Because it does what it is supposed to do and what I want it to do - that is keep my machines clear of infection. The support team are extremely good and only a free phone call away 24/7. I highly recommend the BitDefender product and service to anyone seeking the best."
Eddie R Richardson,3,5,My friend trust me on this one!  GET BITDEFENDER !!!!!
Julie,1,5,"After several failed attempts with different antivirus companies I went on search for a better product, finding BD has been wonderful.  I recommend to everyone and encourage safeco on FB with frequent reminders.  Great product!"
KEN STEGALL,1,1,PROVIDE SIMPLE LOCATION TO DOWNLOAD YOUR PRODUCT.......WHY DO I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH YOUR SELLING CRAP EVERYTIME I WANT TO DOWNLOAD YOUR PRODUCT......SINCE I HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH MY OWN PAGE(S) WHY CAN'T I GET THE DOWNLOAD THERE....AND I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAN MYSELF WHEN I UNINSTALL / REINSTALL YOUR PRODUCT WITH THAT STUPID SURVEY.....
"Robert Thorne, M.D.",1,5,BitDefender is great!
Chien,1,4,I did research and they indicated that Bitdefender is one of top internet security system in the market. So I gave it a try and have been using for past 6 years.
Linda D,6,5,"Compared to other software, Bitdefender is non-invasive and runs quietly in the background.  There is never any frustrating pop ups and requests when I am busy working.  Updating, upgrading and subscription renewals are simple and quick. This is all besides the obvious - outstanding protection against all things internet invasive.  It is a trust thing and I have for many, many years trusted Bitdefender and they have never let me down."
Mervyn France,3,3,"We never know how good you are until something goes wrong. Well, I got hit by Malware and in the correspondence that followed you managed to give the impression that you hadn't read the detail of my message, resulting in irrelevant suggestions. Further correspondence ensued and every time there was a  delay on your part (not inordinate) for which you had a stock apology -one that didn't impress because, if sincere, there would have been no need for a second or subsequent apologies. (What I mean is - you'd have done something about it). Moreover, I found a resolution to my problem via Hitman who seemed more au fait with t his particular problem than you were."
Ankush Saxena,1,5,"Bitdefender is that kind of antivirus, who destroys all Virus, Spyware, Maware, Trojans, etc. it can also disinfects the infected files.first i was using ESET Antivirus,But now im using Bitdefender.Totaly a must companion for every desktops, laptops, but specially for Smartphones.""Superlight Antivirus with All Superpowers in it"""
Philip Nethers,1,3,"I've been using bitdefender for several years and slowly upgrading as time goes by.  As an antivirus and firewall, I've found it to be second to none.  As a spyware/malware blocker it's great too......except for itself.In the last several months, it has started putting its OWN popups into the program which have no way to be disabled unless you call into the company.  This is unacceptable for a program that has a ""game mode"" that keeps anything from happening during a game that would alt-tab you out of the full screen mode (movies too) which was a of the selling points for me.  Oh ya, bitdefender's pop-ups do this now.  This is completely unacceptable.  Even though the base program is still amazing, this is something that will cause me to migrate to another program if not soon removed (without having to call)."
Client  B. SMITH,1,4,"I have used Bitdefender fir several years and been very satisfied.  But his year (2013) I had difficulties in renewing my subscription and downloading the latest version Internet Security.  As a self-taught and not very experienced user I could not easily follow the on-line instructions.  These appeared to me too complicated.  But I was saved by the help of Bitdefender's staff, particularly Maja Ololovska ."
Karen,4,5,"This is the best computer security program I have ever had.  I am totally comfortable knowing everything on my computer is entrusted to them.  I don't trust FREE security programs...you get what you pay for, rather ""don't"" pay for.  I had a FREE program and continued to get viruses.  I hired a new computer tech, and he recommended Bitdefender.  Great recommendation on his part and great decision on mine!"
Client,2,2,"Just check the call Ticket ID:201309021023787 together with the numerous times I followed up and then you will realize that the word ""Terrible support"" might not give the full meaning...."
Glad Tidings Church,2,2,"Bitdefender missed a virus.  The virus will not allow our office desktop on the internet. Does not even pick up that there is a network card.  We had to put a wireless card into our desktop so that we were able to even get on the internet!  We are lucky to be able to even get on the internet that way!  Our computer needs to be fixed.  Brand new just purchased in May 2013.  Sad that we could be hacked while running Bitdefender.  .  I had to uninstall Bitdefender because the virus will not let Bitdefender to run properly.  No internet, no updates. When I uninstalled Bitdefender it didn't remove completely from our computer.  Still in our uninstall programs list.  I can't reinstall Bitdefender because I needed to access online but was not able.  Please feel free to contact us with feedback, questions, answers, and/or a solution to this problem"
Dwaelf Wanderer,3,5,"I've used Bitdefender for years now and can honestly say that I forget I even have it running. The only effect on my computer it has is to keep it virus free. No slow down, as with other anti-virus programs. It does its own thing without stopping me doing mine. It also gives me a short cut to general maintenance like defragging and decluttering which helps me to remember to do it! A great program."
Victoria D Simoneaux,2,5,I have trusted bit defender and the previous versions for compleat security!I did not sign up for auto renew!my bank account is now over drawn!I had already renued.
Jerome Lasker,2,5,I used to use an anti-virus program from another vendor that really slowed down my machine - very awkward interface.  That does not happen with BitDefender - the program keeps getting better & better as time goes on.
Niket Patel,1,5,"A Perfect security software for my home and family. We are rest assured that with bit defender, there is nothing that can go wrong to our gadgets due to virus/worm/malware world."
bryn,4,5,"If your really need piece of mind regarding all your pc operations then Bitdefender will put all of your worries behind you and should you ever need technical help the phone call will be so easy and you will find very helpful friendly assistance , so change to Bitdefender ASAP."
Ross P,1,5,This software offers maximum protection with out taking up a large portion of computing resources like others do.  Keeps your system fast and clean
Marion Jensen,1,2,"I will probably not renew my subscription next year after experiencing difficulty with my account.  After several years successfully using Bitdefender, I paid to upgrade again by credit card.  As it was a few weeks before the payment went through on my credit card statement, I was unaware that I had been billed twice.  My efforts to have the matter corrected, and the second amount of money reimbursed, were frustrating to say the least.  When I finally got through to the relevant company handling the payments, I was told that I was too late to have the money refunded, and was offered a couple of months extension to my subscription.  I am now looking for an alternative for my security."
Mick,4,5,I have been using Bitdefender for almost 2 years. I had only been using free AV & IS programs before unless they came with a new system. This Bitdefender is by far the best. My partner uses Nortons (paid version) & the features of Bitdefende beat it in most categories and definitely in the user control functions.Safepay - is brilliant. I use it for OS travel where we are on WiFi connections. Just came back from 2 months in Europe and the middle east. No Issues in that time.Gets a definite 5 stars from me !
Ray.,3,3,The product works well but knowing what product you have or need is not always obvious.  Has anyone worked out what the difference between Total Security/Sphere/Family packs without having to ask ?  MyBitdefender is a good idea but unfinished.  The language always shows as English US even though my profile clearly indicates I live in the UK and removing devices from the dashboard does not remove them from the list displayed in Anti Theft.  Overall a good product but the web site needs work.
Andy McBride,1,2,"I have Bit Defender total internet security 2013 which I bought in July this year, but I uninstalled this product and I will never buy or use it again!  My computer was running like shit and I had to get it looked at by an IT specialist who informed me I had over 1000 bugs your product failed to detect and deal with.  I now use windows security essentials and my machine is running like a dream."
John Taylor,1,4,Bit Defender has served me well for the last 4 years.  Only problems encountered have been slow to finish updates (daily) whilst on Autopilot.  This may not be due to BD itself and has only started occurring recently.  BD seems to jump out of autopilot into user mode without any input from user.  Technical support is prompt and mostly to the point but standard answers sometime spoil an otherwise great support system.
Paul Watkins,1,5,"Soo far so good this time around. After using a free version of another software, I came back to Bit defender as it was ok the first time I used it, although somewhat more expensive than thefirst time."
prodesktopworks.com,1,5,I have been using both Bitdefender Antivirus and Bitdefender Internet Security versions for years and is the best of all malware removal suite packages. Is my #1 choice when I recommend it to my clients and friends. You cannot go wrong with it and as always very low memory and CPU overhead.
Client,1,5,The best security suite I have used.  Registration/renewal issue solved almost immediately.
Rowdy Prickett,1,4,"I own a dozen+ computers and half as many laptops and twice as many cell phones. I use Bit-defender because every one from the youngest to the oldest and the smartest to the not so smart can be safe using this product. It is reliable most of the time, over the years they have managed to perfect this product into a well oiled machine. My only complaint is the price fluctuations. some days its a very good price and other days it is like wow thats crazy hi... but over all i recommend this product to all of my friends and family and clients.."
Csaba Ruszkai,1,5,"Bitdefender has a very strong protection demonstrated by many test cases of different labs, but I am not satisfied with the function of the cloud engine. Lack of reputation analysis of scanning or running new files (showing lower than 10-100 using and giving annotations on it - red - yellow - green) is in my view the most important deficiency by using the program. It would be great to install SafePay independently from the main components, when I bought the whole software.Thank You for Your very, very good job to defend our digital world!"
Justin Perry,1,1,"I have been a Bitdefender customer for four years, and was offered a renewal price of $29.95 for a year of Internet Security 2014.  After being overcharged (at $49.95), your customer service department has refused to refund me the overcharge and is blaming me for not catching the mistake within a 30-day refund window, even though this is not a ""refund"" situation.  It is a flat-out overcharge.  It is Bitdefender's mistake.  What terrible customer service.  My family and my company will not use Bitdefender products in the future.  My Facebook and Twitter will spread the word of your terrible treatment of your customers."
Jon,7,4,"I have been using Bitdefender for years as it gets good media reviews and is simple to setup and run.  It is great to have the licence for up to 3 computers, covers the laptop and desktop.However they could do better with the renewals process. Each year I have to go through the process of letting the product expire prior to renewing to get the best price offer from them, it is one of the reaslons why I have never signed up to their automatic renewal process."
Mason Pruner,4,4,"Have used Bitdefender for several years now.  Previously i have used Norton and McAfee - both allowed infections to sneak by and crashed computers I have owned.  Have not had an infection since changing to Bitdefender.  My only complaint is on my wife's Vaio that on rare occasions freezes with a blue-screen, in deciphering the code its related to BitDefender - per some forum posts i uncovered.  Its not a big issue since a reboot clears it - a small price to pay for great protection - and its only on the Sony Vaio - two Dells and a Lenovo are fine with the program."
Brad Willingham,1,5,I am very pleased with this software! It does what it says it will do without fail. I find this to be an awesome virus software. I am sold! They have my business....
John Zarro,1,5,"I purchased Bitdefender after losing my entire system to a particularly nasty Virus which wasn't prevented with AVG.  After rebuilding my system, I opted to purchase Bitdefender after reading several reviews on the product.  Since my initial install, I haven't been adversely affected by a virus.  I have seen bitdefender identify and stop a few so, I know it's working, in fact, it even identified a hidden virus in an old file recently scanned on a thumb drive.  I plan on sticking with Bitdefender in the future."
teresa,3,5,"I like and respect and they keep a watch on things, banking and all that is necessary for us to be safe on the computer."
Ronald Leal Client,1,5,"I have three computers, two desktop units in different places and a portable for travel etc. Bitdefender works for me."
William Engel,1,4,"I had some trouble after I upgraded to total security until I finally got it straightened out. It took two emails, and two calls. as well as downloading it twice, but I finally got it. My two biggest complaints are one there isn't enough explanations on how to use some of the tools, and two it doesn't catch a lot of the malware."
Paul Fitzgerald,1,5,"We have Bitdefender Internet Security 2013 on three computers, and we haven't had any problems with viruses. trojans, etc. since we added.  Works behind the scenes so you don't even know it's there."
Rick Bruning,1,5,On more than one occasion I have seen Bitdefender stop another virus or piece of malware cold. The virus/malware  was not only discovered in it's various covert forms but dealt with appropriately. Over time I have become reassured that it is competent and vigilant. It takes care of all aspects of security on my system. This gives me a real peace of mind. I know that Bitdefender is highly rated in the system  security software field and I feel that they have earned it. I hope they will continue to do the great job they have done in the past.
Jefferey J Campbell Jr,1,4,All most no problems at all.
Wade Cramer,1,4,"I would like to have a better understanding of how some of the modules can be used and how they are used like Bitdefender Wallet, Identity protection module. etc."
Jackie Ingram,1,4,I trust BitDefender and have used it for 4 years but this computer is about to crash. Trouble with hard drive so until I get a new computer I will not be able to renew.
Peter E Schwager,1,4,Keeps my computer clean behind the scenes
Bruce Spence,11,3,"Keeps finding the same threats over & over again without ever deleting them for good. Safepay does not allow drop down menus for calendars etc, from the bank sites it's protecting. This makes safepay so much less intuitive to use that I've stopped using Safepay. Noticed that Bitdefender always seems to find more threats the closer you are to the end of your subscription, funny that."
Micheal Stevens,1,5,"I have had a lot of anti-everything out there, all the way back to windows 98, and I have not seen a program that does what bitdefender total security  does. Plus on top of that it is the easiest to understand, from a computer geek like myself, I love that ! Keep up the excellent work guys, every award you win you deserve it and on top of that users of the program win also.   Micheal Stevens"
popeye00,10,5,"If you want a product that is good value for money and provides all the necessary protection Bitdefender is for you.I would rate it 9.5 out of 10.Not had any viruses or malware in 2 years with Bitdefender.What more could you ask for, how good is that!!The desktop gadget keeps you informed and makes you feel even safer.Easy to login and remove old and add new devices.When you renew early you keep your remaining days plus 365 unlike others.My only problems have been with a few bugs usually after upgrades or updates.Occasional networking woes too, well all firewalls are a hurdle not just Bitdefender's.However removing Bitdefender and re-installing was a breeze and this always fixed any problems.Well done Bitdefender and many thanks."
Jackie Krempin,2,4,"Bitdefender is an excellent product.  Easy to download and install.  Easy to set up, and then you don't have to worry about it for 12 months.The only slight criticism I have is that I would like more complete descriptions of what each part of the product does."
Con Finney,1,5,"Problems solved without invasive solutions. Prompt reply's and easy to follow instructions when support team contacted. The product does what it promises to do.Downside the the control panel is so miserable to look at. Loki,s logo should look like he's going to bite you; with colour to match. regards Con"
Customer Keith Darnell,2,5,It's a great quality product. Straightforward to use and covers all potential problems. It's the only security product I would use now.
Palu Weight,4,2,"firstly it has gone up nearly twice as much as I paid last year, I didn't sign up for an automatic renewal, and since it has been updated my pc is running very slow can you help me with these matters.and please cancel the automatic renewal"
DOUG,2,5,After sales service is wonderful. I had a good experience recently while trying to re- install the Bitdefender on my recently fixed computer
Lew Postlethwaite,2,5,Best anti virus software bar none
Helen Dardas,1,4,customer services accepted to correct their error
William Doubledee,1,5,"Over 20 years, I've used almost all of the other AV products at one time or another. A while back, I read the reviews of Bitdefender and took a leaf of faith. I'm glad I leaped. They're really good. Keep up the great work, guys."
Kris,1,4,"I based by decision to buy this product based on online reviews.  Since I am not in the habit of going to unknown or strange websites I don't know how effective this AV program is, but it takes over 15 hours to do a complete scan after updating my previous version."
Customer,6,5,I've had BitDefender for a number of years now and have no complaints. Easy to use interfaces and responsive and courteous customer service make BitDefender a company that is both effective and pleasant to interact with. I highly recommend them!
Mick Gentry,1,5,"I like Bit Defender because of its low overhead on the CPU and it lets me know if their is anything suspicious happening.I have been using it on all my PC's for over 3 years and have proven the product with a track record of ease of use, ease of install and no problems with updates like some of the other anti virus and firewall protection programs out there.I like the program it is easy to use and very powerful, it can be set up very easy for the novice or complex by the more serious computer user.Its a serious company that makes a good product and I am happy with the service and product.I also like how they bundle the packages for 3 computers which like most homes have a least 3 computers to protect.Cheers Mick"
Colin Johanson,1,5,Used it for a number of years now. It didn't like XP at one time but has reliably protected my three computers from all attempts of attack.
Roberta Brooks,1,5,The program runs silently and seamlessly. I have only one slight annoyance with it and that is that once in a while I have to reboot for it to finish it's update. Other than that it keeps my computer safe and I hardly know it's there.
Barry Sumpter,8,5,"Very good easy to use virus software,with good backup from real people not just forums,one to one chat on the phone from good customer services representatives who make you feel like your not being a pain in the arse when your being a bit of a muppet!!!"
Carl Billotte,1,4,I have use Bitdefender for last 5 yrs!I have use Mcafee and Norton but I like Bitdefender over all!
Anne Osborne,3,5,"The reason that I continue to use Bitdefender as my preferred  computer protection is because it offers such a great level of all-round protection.I can use my computer for both business and personal use and  feel secure that my computer has the very best level of protection available.Each time my computer has been threatened with a virus or other malicious item, Bitdefender has stopped my computer from being damaged or negatively affected.Because I work up to eight hours a day on the computer, this is really important to me.And when I am not working, Bitdefender also protects my personal e-mail and Facebook account - Perfect!Thank you Bitdefender!"
Chuck Talk,1,5,"As a former employee of an anti-virus company, find that BitDefender is the best solution on the market currently. Do find it to be less intrusive, not as dumbed-down as other products, and it works reliably.  The fact that the ""major vendors"" really have become lazy and produce lower-quality than Awake has been a big reason for my choice as well. For the few remaining Windows installs that I possess, BitDefender works. Now If they can work on a Linux version for consumers, they will be perfect. ;)"
David Barber,1,5,Very Good product easy to use and reliableI choose this for my home systems and rate it very highly and can recommend itIt Professional
Ivan Dorling,5,5,"Having tried many different protection packages in the past, I switched to Bitdefender in 2007 and have renewed it every year since.In Bitdefender 2013 just leave it in Auto Pilot and you know that your computer is In safe hands.A truly quality protection package. 10 out of 10."
Bob,1,5,"A low resource, heavy hitting bad-guy stopper, that makes spreading malware as much fun as getting hit by a dump truck."
Fred Tandy,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for years and have found that it continues to improve itself by silently protecting my family's use of the world wide web without being a data & memory hog and slowing down our computers--automatically.  For me, it's peace of mind knowing that daily, I don't need to monitor malware and trojans since Bitdefender is on Autopilot."
Ed,1,5,"I have tried many virus protection products since they first started being used and Bitdefender is the best, better than Norton and McAfee. It protects against malware and other security threats to your data and also has many useful tools to keep your computer running at its peak performance. I recommend it to everyone who wants their data protected at a reasonable price."
donald clayden,5,5,"I have been a user of Bitdefender  for many years and in that time it has served me well,nipping any problems in the bud before they have a chance to cause trouble. Family have taken my advice and are also very pleased that they did."
Eva,1,2,"All the advertising materials pushed Bitdefender as an excellent security option that wouldn't slow down your computer.  Nonsense.  As soon as I downloaded the most recent version, my computer's speed tanked, and both Firefox and Chrome started having serious problems, including simply being blocked from accessing the internet--and yes, I did enter them in the list of programs not to block.  I tried fixing it for a while with Bitdefender support, but eventually got so fed up that I uninstalled it, despite not getting my money back.I use Avast now.  The moment I uninstalled Bitdefender, my computer's speeds soared, and they've continued to do so with Avast, which defends my computer just as well--and for FREE."
Gary Morriston,1,5,"In the 2.5 years I have been using Bitdefender, I have had no problems with internet or PC viruses. This by far the best product I have used since purchasing a Dell in 2000."
Bob Thomas,1,5,"I have used BitDefender TotalSecurity for several years, and have been very happy with the product. There have been several minor issues, but BitDefender has always been very responsive, and fixed those issues quickly. The most annoying issue was where for a period of two to three weeks, Silent Updates occurred normally, but as many as 5-15 of those updates per day required a System Restart for the update to complete. It was somewhat annoying to have to restart the system that many times in a single day.  That problem seems to have been fixed where it is now rare to have to restart the system associated with the normal updatesAt this point, I am very satisfied with the product, and would not consider changing to any other product."
Bill Smith,1,5,"Easy install,no snags.Easy to use and customize.Had no problems with customer support.Great product for the price.One could wish other anti-virus programs worked as well."
LOI NGUYEN,2,4,I would like to recommender to my relatives
Gery Byrd,3,5,Ever sense I bought Bitdefender I never had to worry about any viruses ever again.I also love the game mode they come with.
Kevin Southam,4,5,simple mate goto any top ten antivirus review site and bit defenders at the top we've all had problems with Norton and kasper eating memory.....and yet everyone at our lan parties use b/defender....remember when ginko using 360 hooked onto network and bitdefender showed he was virused up the yingyang...need I say more
Len Bell,7,5,I have recommended Bitdefender to many of my friends telling them how satisfied aia am with Bitdefender. It is easy to instal and works away in the background. Great product.
Saji,3,5,"I have been using Bitdefender since last 7 years, My experience with Bitdefender has always been very good. Bitdefender has the best features and its antivirus database is up to date, I have never been let down. The memory utilization is minimum compared to any other products and it has never hogged my machine."
Ty Williams,1,5,Bitdefender offers the best protection on the market for a fraction of the price.
Michal Kulas,1,5,"I was never let down by this product in many aspects - price, security performance, etc etc. Simply, I don't need to look for enything else ever again."
Bud Ross,1,5,"I'm very, very pleased with my Bitdefender Total Security 2013.It keeps my computer clean and quick...Thanks,Bud Ross"
Karl Lee,1,5,"I absolutely love Bitdefender, the protection that it gives my computer is top-of-the-line, with minimal slowdown on my computer. I love Bitdefender, and I would recommend it to anyone."
David Stgringer,2,5,I've used Bitdefender for the past two years and find it invaluable and trustworthy.  Intuitive to set up and leave in automatic mode. I would recommend this protection to anyone who values their data!
P.Thorp,21,5,No long winded review from me ! It just does the job reliably and easily so I would recommend Bitdefender to anyone.
Mr Leslie Thomson,4,5,Ticks away quietly doing a great job easy to scan for any viruses some Trojan horse programs do get through but nothing serious and can normally be cleared after doing a full system scan have used bitdefender for many years recommended to all my friend.
Destry DeWolf,3,5,"I have been in personal and enterprise computing since the 80's. I also have worked with all the big name brand AV+ engines. Not since PCillian (early 2000), there has not been an AV that rivals the BitDefender series of products. The other big name AV programs bog down system resources claim to catch in-progress illegal entities. The reality is that when items are being downloaded, the big name AV engines catch the entities after it has been downloaded and stored blocked on the HDD or a RAM memory block. BitDefender catches the item while it is being downloaded and ceases the download before the block can be filled. I love that! Whether I want to view ""banned' sites or enterprise networks, I am protected. With all the extra products that come with the series of BitDefender products (firewall, credit watch, et cetera) that are easy to use and program, I feel that they are bonuses and not paid-for programs. BitDefender is the engine for me!"
Sonique77,2,5,"Easy to use, provides a good level of protection while not restricting me too much. Very little tweeking required on set up. No fuss at all."
Vic,3,5,"I've been with Bitdefender for a few years now and will not hesitate to renew with them, as long as they maintain a competitive price.Their internet security is the best I've ever had, and I've used some of the other ""top"" competitors.It's difficult to know when a virus scan is in progress as I can't detect a computer slow-down as I did with other brands. And I no longer get shocking advices, telling me that I have some kind of virus which requires my personal and complicated actions to eradicate it.Spend your money on Bitdefender Internet Security. You will not be disappointed!!!"
Terrorbite,1,2,Updating to newer versions of the business client product have always caused support issues at my company. Installing the clients is awkward from the interface and doesn't do well with Windows User Account Control. Scheduled processes get messed up every time Daylight savings time changes. Have had support requests ignored on the support forum. The client itself seems to have good protection if you can reliably get it to work with the management server.
Lee Jensen,2,5,"Bitdefender is indeed a defender against virus, malware and other disgusting things we can see on personal computers.It is easy to use and very fast. Some packages like one of your competitors is very slow and cumbersome and seems to take forever. I have used your software for the past 3 years and will continue to use it as long as I have my PC. Please watch out that any improvements do not degrade what you have now."
Mario Mesa,1,5,Since I was introduce to your antivirus system I believe is one of the best out there if not the best. Please keep up the good work.
Larry Katz,1,5,"I have had all the other ""Big Boys"" of the antivirus market and have had my computer hard drive burned. So  after replacing 2 desktops an IT friend suggested BitDefender. Back then you were a little know software company out of Canada. So I decide to give you guys a try. I have been happy ever since my first Issue in 2008. I've never had my computer corrupted or files lost due to hackers. The antispam, phishing and identity protection is second to none. Price, ease of use and customer service are all #1. I have had only the Total security packages and will never try another security package from any other maker.. Thanks Bitdefender:)"
Owen Gale,1,5,"Bitdefender is not cheap, but nor is it the most expensive I have seen. I have been using it for a couple of years now and have only had one attack get past it, and an update got rid of that. That is a much better record than any other anti-virus I have tried, especially seeing as I am pretty active on the net."
Michael Montalvo,1,5,"I don't normally rate things because I always assume that they get lost in the mix of everything. The one thing I feel that is very important and now a requirement of any computer that's connected to the internet is protection from whatever lurks beyond the wall.  Yeah, that was a Game of Thrones reference. Anywho. I was never a fan of 'buying' Antivirus software and I would always go the cheap route by using whatever free protection I could find on the internet. Then one day I got infected with something pretty nasty and my trusty ol' free software did not cut it at all. I started to research online to find the right software. Bitdefender was always listed as number 1. The one feature that I liked that they marketed themselves on was that their software wasn't overpowering to your system. It ran in the background and used as little memory as possible.To make this gigantic story a whole heck of a lot shorter, for the last 7 years I have been using Bitdefender and I'm always a happy customer. I buy their new Total Security key every year and it's nothing but grand. Compared to the others that are out there, they can't even scale up against Bitdefender. You can set it to autopilot and it does all the work for you. I apologize because I have such bad ADHD I have a hard time articulating my thoughts and look a bird!I'll be a lifelong Bitdefender customer as long as I have a computer. Thanks for putting out great software guys and gals."
Michael Cross,1,3,Upgrade nag screens ruin my experience of BD. You have no business spamming me like that - as a result I will not be renewing.
Robert Jay Berkowitz,1,4,Great protection for your pc needs.  Lots of controls available and great firewall.
DeUs Wayne,1,5,"Been using bitdefender products for 2 year and didnt have any issue on Virus, Phising etc.  We feel secure."
Allan Binding,5,5,No problems with the software.
Greg Nkanang,6,4,Affordable! Easy to install. Does not slow the computer or device down.
John Andrews,18,5,Full review?  Not really needed.1 install software2 enjoy internet safety and security3 that's it!
K.C.Wong,1,2,My current license is valid till July 2014 but your 2 agents forcibly renewed 2 more licenses total 2 years which was charged to my credit card in Oct. 2013.  Your sales department still has not acknowledged the errors and even try to entice me to accept more than 3 years of license. I feel deceived and it took a lot of efforts to get refunds. Very poor public relation due to your company policy and systemic error.
James Freebairn,1,5,Ever since obtaining Bitdefender I have had no problems and can recommend it to you as a very good reliable and effective program.
Kevin Rowe,3,4,"There is little doubt Bit Defender  very good, however I get very frustrated when trying to do Banking on line , especially when trying to get a receipt when paying by B'pay. It takes a very long time to get a receipt which is very frustrating, when in the past a virtual click & you could print it out. Also it is much harder to log out from my Bank which is very time consuming."
Client Ken Mac'Donald,1,5,Since changing to Bitdefender we have not had viruses as with a previous brand.
Client,1,3,Why does it not protect me from Snapdo! Majior problems  ALSO..does not let me do a System Restore .  Major Problem
Lawrence C,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for  some time. I enjoy the continuous protection that come with the program. They also offer great tech support. I have install Bitdefender on three of my computers.  I would recommend this virus protection program to family and friends.ThanksLC
Amit Darbar,14,4,I am happy with BitDefender.  It offers a very good AV solution with a friendly user-interface.
Richard  Cleary,2,3,"Good software but you need a way to temporarily disable it, as when doing a System Restore, etc. Some s/w won't install when Bit Defender is running. It gets old deleting and then restoring Bit Defender to accomodate System Restores and some s/w.Again, you need an easy way to temporarily disable Bit Defender."
Client,2,2,i just had to reinstall windows thanks to all the stuff bitdefender missed. i had so many viruses on my pc i downloaded malwarebytes adwarecleaner and hitman pro but by the time i got it cleaned up it was to late it was time for a complete restore  so now i keep the free version of malwarebytes on my computer
Robert,2,5,"Bitdefender is a product that I am happy with, service response is prompt and helpful."
Daniel Furlin,2,5,"I have Bitdefender Internet Security and love it. Everything is super except for 1 feature that I have trouble understanding........Safego. It is, almost daily, alerting me to Facebook possible ""infections."" BUT what do these alerts accomplish? There are no actions to address these alerts. So all I do is delete the messages. I wish Bitdender would instruct us, EXACTLY, how to deal with these Facebook alerts. Or have a way where we can FIX them. Other then that, I love the Bitdefender product."
Tudor,1,5,Excellent job
K McCann,1,5,"The support team is very helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I had a great experience when calling about an issue that they fixed."
Drwho9,1,3,"I've actually had this version, 2013, stop and lock up when I'm doing a system scan. That's never happened with past editions. This versions has also blocked Windows updates...I've never had that happen before."
Highcountryrider,1,3,"I've used Bitdefender Internet Security for about 6 years now. I always update to the latest version. Overall, I still think the software is one of the better Internet Security suites available and it's AV engine is top notch.My main gripe about BD IS 2014 is the unbelievably long time it takes to do a full system scan. It now takes between 2  and 3 hours or longer  to do a full system scan and it really isn't that large, about 100 GB. I know Bitdefender suggests that there is no reason to do full system scans as the product supposedly protects everything when in Auto Pilot mode but I am old school enough to want to do a full scan at least once a month. Two or more hours is just way too long to have to wait for a full scan to complete."
Beverly Runnels,1,5,That tells me that they are watching out for me.
Roger,1,5,The easiest and seamless package for protecting your computer and precious data.  Utterly fool proof and safe.  What more do you want!
Client Johnny Looper,1,5,My opinion is that this program is the best on the market and I would suggest it to anyone who needs internet security.
Client,1,3,"As far as Antivirus software goes, I've been very pleased with Bitdefender.  However, their customer service and the third party billing company they use, Avangate, have left me frustrated.  I was double billed for my renewal this year and have spent the last month trying to get it resolved."
Ruth Jones,1,5,"I truly would recommend you getting this protection.  We have had Norton (bad), McAffie (would not recommend), and Windows Live One (loved this one), but Bitdefender is so far the best."
Richard A KIng,1,1,I had a problem with Bitdefender and sent an email to customer service several weeks ago.  The ONLY response I got was this survey.  I'm looking for a better Antivirus protection company
Fred in Cleveland,2,4,No maintenance unless it finds something wrong.  Easy fixes to problems it does find. Eg: Updates are ready to run--click here.
Kent,2,5,Over the years I have tried the major players in the virus protection field.  Bitdefender  gives very good protection with minimal intrusion and slow down.  Consistently great performance and reasonable price.  I highly recommend it.
Carlos,1,3,"My first 2 years using Bitdefender were great. Then it went down hill. Midway through the third year my laptop began crashing. When I looked at the log files it showed Bitdefender as being the application at fault. Bitdefender fixed it. Then progrmas would not run unless the firewall would be off. Again another fix. Before the fourth year, my subsciption was auto renewed even after I had disabled that feature at the start of year 2. The last 2 version say they don't take much computer power but I can barel browse the web without my computers freezing up because of the updates Bitdefender does."
Lorie,1,5,"After purchasing Bitdefender, I got a new computer.  Long story short, I installed Bitdefender 3 times and customer service was excellent help each time. Also, Bitdefender notifies me of updates I need and issues they have corrected.  I feel internet safe with Bitdefender!"
Lorenzo,1,5,"I've been in the computer industry for over 24 years and worked with many AV/IS programs including Norton,and McAfee.  Those two products, however, are a let down as they allowed far too many viruses to slip through their protection and whenever I'd try to resolve issues through tech support I'm always told the same thing ""Update your virus signature and run another scan.""  Which I'd do but it still wouldn't find or eliminate the infection.  So I came across BitDefender searching online for top reviewed AV software.  I downloaded the trial and it clear up everything that the other two big shot programs couldn't.  Also the price is reasonable, it's easy to use, and I like the interface.  It has a lot of options and provides so far the best protection against viruses, key-loggers, tracking cookies, port scans, etc.   I'd would definitely recommend this software.  If you haven't, download the trail and see for yourself."
Ron Tracy,1,5,"With the exception of the cloud services Bitdefender is the best virus protection I have found.  It automatically detects and removes threats and scans while my computer is not doing anything so it does not interrupt me or slow me down when I want to use my computer.  It also has the tech ability to run updates, scans and diagnostics and you can participate according to your level of expertise."
Laurie,1,5,Never have to worry about anything attacking my computers or someone accessing my personal banking info.  Lots of security.
John,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for many years now, ever since I first saw an add for it on the net. The reviews even back then were good, and today it's the best in my opinion. If you use norton or any other anti-virus program, try Bitdefender for a year, I use Total Internet Security and upgraded this year to the family pack which has all the tools and features of Total Internet Security but also has mobile phone and tablet security too. If you dont know how to use an anti-virus program, no worries, just flick it to Auto Pilot and it will do the lot for you. In my opinion, Bitdefender Total Internet Security is the best!!"
bvar,2,5,"I've been using BD for a few years now on more than a dozen pc's. I couldn't be any happier. Nothing, and I mean nothing, has infected any of these pc's. Now on some of my clients pc's I've removed viruses, a variety of trojan infections, a rootkit or two, and all sorts of adware. Not one of these pc's was protected by Bitdefender but by the other big names. I recommend BD to them and often they allow me to install the current BD version for them. Overall the years I've been using and working on pc's Bitdefender is the single most outstanding security software I've ever used. I highly recommend you install Bitdefender asap even if it means getting rid of your current security software prematurely. It is worth it!"
Craig Williams.,1,5,"You pay a bit for this, but you gets what you pays for, as the saying goes.  I am sure this has saved us one heck of a lot of trouble over the time we have had it installed."
Simon,1,4,"Almost all of this program I find fantastic. I have only one issue with a Port Scan issue...Bitdefender is installed on my HTPC which is also running XBMC.I control XBMC with my Android phone and/or tablet, when I select to play some media Bitdefender detects a Port Scan and blocks the device from talking to my HTPC for some period of time.I have added the IP address of these devices to be allowed in the firewall, but they are still blocked next time I select to play something."
Jerome V.,1,2,"I purchased a new license 2 months before the end of the remaining one. Instead to have a merge (365+64 days). I had 64 days (on Bitdefender Total Security 2013) and 365 days (on Bitdefender Total Security 2014).I sent a note to the support and they NEVER replied back to me. Now I have 342 days left on my new licence and 41 days on my older one.So, be careful when you purchase a new license because they will steal you all the remaining days of the previous one !!!"
Ewing Hall,1,2,"If you use the banking interface, you will be frustrated.  You cannot open any other windows while using it, so you cannot check what's going into banking while reviewing any other information.  I could not figure out how to disable this application, so I simply removed the entire software package from my computer....not perhaps a good thing, but the only way I could figure out how to enable the multifunction capability I was looking for.  FIX THIS PLEASE!!!"
sailesh pallapothu,3,5,"I like the fact that i can remotely install this on 3 pcs, mine, sisters, mom's. And the autopilot. Click and forget. Have been using this product for years and tell people and friends to ditch McAfee and Norton and see the difference."
Will Abdo,2,5,Bitdefender is an all round reliable computer protection and tuneup tool achieved with ease.  It runs effortlessly in the backgoround giving you total peace of mind against unwanted malicious intrusions.  Good Job to the Bitdefender team on a great product.
Gene Cortright,1,4,"Bitdefender has performed well.  Never any problems with virus or unwanted programs.  I have used BD for at least 3 years.  My only complaint would be that updates take longer to download than some other popular virus software, but since it runs in the background, it is not a significant issue."
Andrea Strain,1,1,I am very dissatisfied with your company I just want my money credited back in full.This is not funny and I don't want to have a problem with requesting a full refund from you.Please contact me as to when the refund will take place.Thank you
James,2,5,"Brilliant product, i've been using for years for my PC's, friends and family (12 in all now i think), its cheap and awesome can you ask for anything more?Love it. Install and forget (autopilot is genius!!)James"
Client,1,5,Bit Defender has worked very well with no issues whatsoever. Great product.
Andrew Ford,1,4,"I have used several of the top rated/ reviewed Internet security programs for both home and business over the last 40 years. Bitdefender Total Internet Security is by far the fastest, least disruptive, and most thorough.Safe Box, File Encryption, Anti Spam, Tuneup/Optimize, Facebook Protection, and Privacy/File Shredder all work well and are increasingly necessary for protection and PC health.I would give BD  5 stars if the Auto Update worked on my computer. Have been working with BD support for months. BD support is quick to respond, but, after many suggestions, no auto OR manual updates occur unless I uninstall/repair BD and restart. Several times the problem seemed to be fixed and BD would update for a few days, but then the problem came back and still exists.Problem happened when I upgraded (?) to Windows 8 and down loaded the latest BD. My second computer is still Windows 7 and BD runs just fine with no problems.Hopefully Support will stick with me and we will solve this very frustrating issue.A suggestion...Elevate your problem to top level support as soon as possible. Amazing how much more detailed and thorough the support response has been."
Bette (White Crow) Inman,1,5,"We have had perfect performance from both the software and support.  When others get hit with virus issues, we always recommend Bit Defender with absolutely complete confidence that it will work for them as well as it does for us!"
Mrs. Brenda Gale,1,5,I have had Bitdefender for a couple of years.  With this program I feel my computer is in safe mode and taken care of.  This leaves me free to think about other things.  I would recommend your service to everyone.  Thank you for what you do.
James Boncimino,1,5,Great product. Install and let it do it's job. How easy is that?
Jean-Jacques Dubois,1,2,"Bit Defender crashes often, especially when switching users on Widows 7. The service and especially the updater hog CPU and bandwidth, but only some of the time.The only reason I have not switched to another product is that the pricing for current users is very competitive."
Peter White,5,4,"I've used Bitdefender for a number of years and haven't had any major problems to report. I only had a couple of small problems regarding renewing the software and this was sorted out by them when it was brought to their attention and also the anti theft location software which I'm not 100% sold on yet. However, I wouldn't keep using them if I wasn't convinced that they are excellent at what they do!"
Darlene Lance,2,5,"Have had good results with Bit Defender. No problems with customer service, very good, would recommend."
Client Leigh Hughes,6,4,I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS IN FACT THEY HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD. THEY  SORTED OUT ALL MY PROBLEMS AND EVERYTHING IS RUNNING PERFECT.I WOULD RECOMMENDED THEM
4 year user,1,3,"When I first got BitDedender back in 2009, I was truly impressed. I had done some research on virus scanners that had low overhead and BitDefender was, I believe, second and the most economical choice. While it has remained an economical solution, the low overhead has been replaced with some unnecessary whistles and bells. I made the mistake of upgrading to Total Security and have noted a dramatic hit to my boot up. I also had some difficulty with my subscription actually upgrading.  When my current subscription ends, I will either return to Internet Security or switch to a different product entirely. I wanted an unintrucive, elegant solution for gaming, and BitDefender has lost that, I'm afraid."
Sam Artino,1,5,"In the past, I've had to reinstall my operating system at least once a year due to a virus infection.  Each time, I've had a top rated anti-virus program, yet still became infected. Since 2009 when I got windows7, I decided I'm going to try yet another well rated anti-virus program.  Here I am, 4 years later, still running that same windows7 installation with BitDefender protecting it.  Each year getting a new license with new features added, it's hard to imagine using anything else.  With social networking, and so many ways to communicate and new ways for a virus to sneak it's way onto your system, it is even more crucial than ever for a well produced anti-virus product to include features to protect your data.  Not just your operating system, but things that are important to ME.  A PC is an electronic book that reflects what a person is.  My photo's, recipes, receipts,  pastime story writing among other tings make up a part of who you are, and how you think. To loose that from a malicious virus, it's very emotional.   I know, with BitDefender, they only thing I have to worry about anymore is hardware failure.  It's simply the best."
Hugh Robertshawe,1,5,I like bitdefender because it is reasonably priced and so far has caught all attempts of viruses to invade my system. It doesn't appear to load down the day to day operation of the system.
John King,1,5,Best anti virus since sliced bread.
Peter Ollerton,1,5,"Not only would I recommend but I have recommended BitDefender to many many friends. It is a total suite encompassing all assets required to operate safely in today's web, desktop and mobile arena. The phone and tablet service on Android work great. On Win 7 and 8 it is great and does not slow down the Laptop at all.I cannot recommend this product strongly enough and I have tried 8 out of the top 10 many times over."
Stephen Thomas,5,3,"Software becoming more stealthy, not a bad thing, but when the Internet suddenly stops working and you find the cause is the firewall, the damage is already done. If there is a need to configure the firewall, then the user needs to be more advanced than before. I had no warning of this requirement hence my surprise to discover the cause."
Michael Roworth,1,5,I have been using this software for years. It completely protects our whole family from computer problems.
John Loudon,2,5,i have used a lot of anti virus programmes over the years. Some are good and some a not so good but Bitdefender is the best I have ever used. It is simple to use and you don't need a degree in programming to use it. An added bonus of course is the price. Occasionally bitdefender promotions appear that ensure that you get it even cheaper than the others so what this means is that you are paying very little for a top of the range program. I love it.
M Teece,3,5,used this product  for over 4 years
JDS26CA,1,5,"I have been a long time user of both Norton and McAfee at one point or another.  I have had so many issues with them--either the product makes the system slow, or as I've read reviews, neither one has done well keeping up with malware.  I chose Bitdefender after reading PC Mag's round-up a few years ago, and have never looked back.  The interface is quite user-friendly, and for the most part, I've not had to do much as it runs with minimal impact on auto-pilot.  I have purchased 2 licenses for 6 systems in my household, and have used customer service (for billing issues) with no hassle.  I would/have recommend this product."
Mungle,1,2,"My computer was running slower and slower, despite doing all the regular housekeeping: when I took it in to the techos they found that BitDefender had corrupted a number of files, and there were trojans and viruses in the computer. Prior to this BitDefender would crash every time just after boot-up, extremely annoying. Needless to say I have uninstalled Bitdefender and am now using another antivirus program. Would not recommend BitDefender."
Stephen Duggan,36,5,have used bitdefender for several years now always very pleased with the product and always keeps my computer safe and always a good price to renew each year.
Mary Wetherington,1,5,"Although Bitdefender has many more functions, my primary interest was in finding a dependable virus protection.  Bitdefender has done that for me much better than any other product I have used.  In addition, there are a number of other useful options included in this package."
"TK, Knoxville, Tn",1,5,"I've tried various virus protection programs over the years, and some were pretty good, but non as good as this one.  I recall using one (supposedly reputable) program that would alert you - AFTER the virus had already embedded itself in your machine. Well, duh!!  If you're surfing the net and unknowingly come across any of the bad stuff, this program will pick it up - block, and stop you in your tracks; alerting you of the hazard that lay ahead. Works for me."
Dave Elliott,1,3,"Right now I am not very happy with service!! I have paid on 2 accounts and keep getting messages that am about to run out of service. Currently shows that I have bit-defender loaded twice, this is how it all started!!  NOT HAPPY   Dave Elliott"
MABLE WILLIAMS,1,5,I HAVE TOLD MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT  AND HOW GOOD IT IS. ALSO HOW LONG I HAVE USED IT AND THAT I TRULY TRUST IT.
Donna,1,5,"I have never had a problem with Bitdefender. The guys at the computer shop downloaded it for me 3 years ago. I have bought it every year since then. I will never use anything else. It catches, querentine and deletes all viruses. GREAT"
JaneDavis,3,5,"I was one of those users that until a few years ago thought I could get by with a free program. Well, I don't believe that's a viable solution these days. I wanted a product to do it all with minimal intervention/maintenance on my part as I'm no expert user. I needed a product that was not too expensive and a product that did not slow my machine. I'm very happy with my Bitdefender Total Security product and would certainly recommend it to anyone. I am really liking the widget (which I could minimize if desired) because  a quick glance tells me all I need to know regarding any necessary intervention on my end. Even then, it handles issues efficiently and pretty much on it's own."
john nash,3,5,"Since  I switched to bitdefender I have never thought of using any other security softwear.If u leave it in autopilot thats it job done it runs in the background will swich to gaming mode if you game, or laptop mode if you switch to battery use. Customer service. when I have used it has been second to none always that personal touch ie. Not thank you coustomer for your email but thank you john  and the follow up to make sure all is well.  Keeps me safe what more could I want so thank you"
Michael Vittorio,1,5,Bitdefender is a fantastic program to keep the viruses out. I wouldn't trust any other antivirus software on my computers.
Margaret,4,3,"Rather tired of being bombarded with e-mails for months on end offering me all sorts of special deals on your latest products at special prices all of which I as a mere home user don't need!!  Trust ceases when you find that renewal is not offered at the lowest prices so loyalty is meaningless to you. To summarise - don't feel confident, all jargon, so remote, stressful."
Client Michael Chapman,1,5,From my experience I am unable to be critical at all about this product and the 'apparent' protection it gives. I say 'apparent' because at most times I am unaware that the profound protection that has been achieved. I am simply aware that there are many misguided people out there who would appear to derive enjoyment in using me as a subject for virus infection!
Derrick Stoutamire,1,5,"No trouble with my computer, easy use & any trouble phone call away."
John Spring,1,4,"A few years ago, a computer tech installed Bitdefender coupled with another program in place of another virus protection program I had been relying on. I thought this was presumptuous but he said Bitdefender was the best. My other program had not protected me so I thought I had to trust him. Since then, I have found Bitdefender reliable. I had some worries recently when I came under viral attack recently but my (new) tech says it came in via a website I had opened. Can't think what. However, now I have had a clean up and Bitdefender is working again, I feel reassured. I hope my faith is well placed."
Steve J,2,4,BD Total Security. Easy to install.  Covered our 2 computers. There are very frequent updates.  I've never had a security problem.  BD has intercepted a couple of threats and scans pick up and clean tracking cookies.  I've only had a couple of problems with the functionality that have been quickly sorted out via email.Very satisfied and will be staying with BitDefender.
Bill,1,2,"Paid for Bitdefender for a few years now and recently ended up getting a virus just by going to a web page. Ended up losing everything only computer and had to reformat hard drive back to when I first got it in order to use it. For paying for AntiVirus I expected to be protected but that didn't happen. It wasn't even a new virus, it had already been circulating. Definitely reconsidering my options when it's time to renew."
Vikki Edmonds,1,4,"A great product, I  have full confidence in it and the staff are extremely helpful if you have a problem'"
Ronald R Huebner,1,4,I purchased anti virus and computer repair 2013/09/20.  The antivirus installed and is working well.  I lost the email link to the repair program when my email program crashed.  Am I simply out of luck?My email address is ron@ronhuebner.us.
Client,1,5,great job bitdefender.
ClientDERF,1,5,EASY TO USE FOR BEGINNERS.
Dihan De Silva,2,5,"I have been using Bitdefender products for the past 5 years of more on PCs, Android Tablets, Android Phones and has found this product to be accurately doing what it should be.I am a happy customer :)"
jeff caliva,1,3,"This is the second year i have fought we you over auto renew. I dislike it very much, love your product. Its take way too many hoops and hurdles to get a refund. I can real close to choosing another product this time."
Ismael A Ochoa,1,5,"I like how I can set up the program to just simply monitor all activities. It warns me of potential threats including on sites that one wouldn't even consider such as facebook. It takes care of any problems and runs all the necessary updates required. That's why it is a very easy program to use. As long as my status is green, my attention is not required."
"Greg M. Busch, A user not a techie",1,4,"I have used BD for many years, why, because I was getting sick of the other main stream antivirus programs and asked friends of mine what they used. Bit Defender seemed to have come up often as an answer to my question.As the main user I am completely at a lose trying to figure out how BD works and why certain things happen to it. Why is my anti-virus constantly ""OFF""? I'm asked to run a program and send in the results and I get the boiler answer of: There are no viruses, OK by why does the Antivirus turned off and the Automatic update off. Guess BD doesn't know either. SO I guess I'll stay with BD until my friends suggest another program.The customer service from India has always been extremely helpful and when questions  are submitted the responses are quick, I have an extremely hard tiem understanding them sometimes, but that's baseball.Maybe they need to make, ""Bit Defender for Dummies""."
Art OConner,1,5,"It handles everything in the background, I dont have to do anything but surf safley."
Robert H Jessup,1,5,"I keep renewing Bit Defender because it works & works extremely well.  BD's customer service (on the rare occasion you might need it) is excellent.  I strongly recommend it as your total package for viruses, malware, etc. prevention."
Kent S,2,3,"I purchased a new 2 year license for Bit Defender 2013 however one of my computers is running Windows XP 64 bit and your product said basically ""sorry, your OS is too old"".  My plan wasn't to upgrade my antivirus and then have it tell me that it can't install on one of my computers.  I had been running Bit Defender on that computer just fine until I upgraded.  Now I have no antivirus on it.  Little pissed off about that."
Harry,1,1,"I had TS2012 on my old computer, however, it went tango- uniform and I purchased an windows 8 version. The 2012, Software would not load on the new computer, so I purchased the ts2013 it loaded and work on the new computer until I did the 8.1 update, then it had issues. I have been communicating with customer support and they gave me instructions on down loading and installing ts2014. However, I have tried their suggestions and I can not get the 2014 to load either, I get a,-- need to be connected to the internet message-- after I just downloaded it over the internet. I saved it to a disc and I get the same message. I guess my options are, get my computer checked out, go back to windows 8, or purchase other software and try it.Right now I only have whatever protection Windows provides."
Client,2,5,Easy to usePowerfulSmartEffective
Map75,1,5,best virus detection of any antivirus I have ever tried. the firewall included is excellent.
Artur,2,5,"Very good, has room for improvement, buy it"
Cheryl Geeting,5,5,I have tried other security protectors but Bitdefender is by far the best!!!
Eric Johnsen,1,5,"I never saw a virus or had any problems with my software or internet when using Bitdefender.  I have since used another product on another computer and see the pronounced difference, having a less effective product, it can make."
Client,4,5,Great all round security and protection. Good piece of mind.
stuart parker-jones,4,4,"Great tool and I recommend it to everyone, but I'm continually having to conduct maintenance because the other members of my family do get it.In some cases it needs to work like an ""appliance"" - once it is turned on it does It's job with little human intervention.The other issue is that if your internet is down bitdefender will not work - not good if all you want to do is quick typing task."
Thomas R Yearnshaw,3,4,"I gave up on Norton's products 5-6 years ago and have been using Bitdefender ever since. I have generally been very pleased with their AV products.  I've had a few issues with installations and uninstallations, but the BD Uninstaller Tool has been effective in helping with those.  Customer Support has been resonsive to problems, and the BD forums also provide substantial help. A few threats have slipped through over those years, but very few, and as a whole, I feel Bitdefender protects me very well.  I do feel at times that internet downloading is slowed, but that's a price a person pays for good protection.  Generally, I feel that Bitdefender provides a good balance between protection and speed.I generally use the Tune-Up tools as secondary programs to others that I use, but they are nice additions to the basic AV and Internet security products.I'd give this a 4.5 if that rating were available.  The only ding I have on Bitdefender Total Security is an occasional glitch which is usually solved quickly and easily."
R.L. Durham,1,4,"I have used the Bitdefender Internet Security program on three of my computers for the passed two years and have not experience any virus problems that was not resolved.  The program has done exactly what was said it would do and has met all of my expectations.  Therefore, in my opinion it is one of the best (if not the best) total internet security I have used."
reventsoftware.com,1,4,I like the Game mode and the fact that most of the time this antivirus program does its job without bugging or interrupting me.
Jim Spencer,4,5,"I am not a new user of Bitdefender, and they are not the only virus control I have tried. But, by far, Bitdefender is the easiest, and most trouble free system I have used. I just sit back and let the product do its job. To date, I have not been given a ""bad"" read and for that, I thank Bitdefender for such a great product. I keep looking for questionable things and there never is one. Last, the price is right, and as long as this software meets my needs, I will continue to use their product."
Client John M.,1,5,It's simple. BIS does exactly what it is adveertised to do.
Michael Lomax,1,5,"I like the many platforms that are covered by Bitdefender. So many products cover your computer well but you have to purchace other software to cover your other devices like ipods, tablets and cell phones. This can add to the cost of protecting your devices. Bitdefender covers all your devices with ease, they make it easy to install and ues their software on all your devices.Basically, I think this is the only security software you will ever need."
A Gomez,1,4,"Superb, I believe in your product and I will recommend Bitdefender for everyday use."
peter muhs,2,5,from day one this has been the best internet security on the market by far. it is easy to use and understand
Client,16,5,Wonderful products and fair prices
Client ;   Barbara Kendall,1,5,"I really like bitdefender for the fact I do not have to worry about my computer being protected.  EX> The other evening I was doing some work, also talking to a friend on the computer. All of a sudden my computer goes black, nothing. After a few moments the screen comes back on and tells me to start it in safe mode. Thank goodness I had bitdefender. I lost absolutely nothing and everything was brought back to origional. In a few minutes bitdefender came on & advised me that I hed a severe warning of a virus attacking my computer and it had stopped it.  HURRAY for you guys!!!!!! Can't say enough!!!!! Kudo's to you !!!!!!"
DJ Blackman,1,5,"I have used this product for years literally, and have shared it with family and friends.  I was constantly removing viruses an family computers, but not for a long time now.  With a little bit of education for my family and this antivirus the threat is minimal at best.  The last virus scare for my family has been over 2 years now.  I constantly recommend this product and will continue to do so.  Keep up the great work guys, and thank you for making my family visits computer issue free."
Eugene,1,2,"My expiration date was coming to the end on my Mac and Windows computers.  Instead of auto renewal, I decided to buy the most current version for them both in August.  The beginning of October I receive an email from Bitdefender stating I have just been charged for auto renewal of the over version of Mac and Windows antivirus.  I contacted Bitdefender of there mistake and to refund me my money.  So far, it is not a easy process to resolve.  Instead of refund, they want to include the license days to my current license + 60 days.  I told them I will take it if they take off the auto renewal.  Bitdefender later change the deal by offering to give me +60 days for the additional computer I could load the software from the old version of the antivirus.  So agreed by stating I will be getting (279 days (old license) + 365 (new license) + 60 (they offered) + 60 (they offered).  Bitdefender want to take away 1 of the + 60 days from both the Mac and Windows.  Also, they have reduced the number of days for the Windows license key I never wanted.  So, instead of giving me 365 days, they want to say I will get 347 days for something I never used.  Currently we have not come to an agreement.  I last email was to refund my money.  I don't want to agree on something then Bitdefender decide they want to change the deal again.  This is beginning to be a big headache."
Mark Woods,1,5,I have been using Bitdefender for several years.  I came over as a result of reviews I had read-as well as the price.  I have stayed with Bitdefender because I find it to be a good comprehensive security product.  It is easy to learn and simple to use.
Andy,1,5,I find the program so easy to use. The control panel is self-explanatory and I will continue to use Bitdefender to protect my computer.
Terry Rong,1,5,Bitdefender keeps my computers clean from all kinds of malware and viruses
Shane,1,5,The pricing structure that allows the user to have multiple pc's protected is great.  The user dashboard is a terrific way to help keep track of updates and software versions as well as renewal dates.  The user interface is easy to understand and navigate.
Jake,1,2,"I have had Bit-defender for around 5 years and got my gaming computer 4 years a ago. Every summer my gaming computer gets a virus some times it a DOS some times its a polymorphic some things its advanced scare ware, and every time I'm forced to re-install windows. For some one who have around 900 gigs in games that's rather annoying, that and the fact that its every summer, its not like I'm using my $3000 computer to look up porn. I'm playing games and using steam and stuff, but yet it always get a virus. I have to say that Bit-defender it not going to be getting my service again I'm moving on the Mal-Ware bites and not looking back."
Michael Coulter,2,5,"Before I had BitD, I would have problems with viruses contaminating my operatingsoftware (windows XP) and wind up reloading XP (lucky I had the disc). I read about BitD in an online top ten review, it was rated number one and the price was fair, so I bit the bullet and bought my third and LAST antivirus software.  Buyer beware, if you have a older desktop like me, you might have to upgrade your memory.( less than 100 bucks and worth it)  Since installing BitD I've been on my system every day(3 years)  and no problems, I love the Safepay for personal banking online and there are features that I have not even used yet !  Way to go BitD!!!"
Kirk Schablik,2,5,"I have made the mistake, and have seen other PCs where the administrator made the mistake, of letting their Antivirus expire. I have seen Bitdefender rescue systems that appeared as if they may be beyond repair. Bitdefender has always been able to rescue PCs from the viruses that I have seen."
Danny E. Gould,1,4,"I think Bitdefender is great but it lack a good root detector and remove tool. I contacted tech support they told me that it is included with bitdefender total security. However when I ran a root kit program after doing a complete scan with bitdefender total security 2013, it fond and removed several threats."
Patricia,9,4,"I have had Bitdefender for several years after previously using another service which was active when my computer got a trojan virus.  This has not happened with Bitdefender.  Download and activation instructions are easy to follow, and customer service has always been responsive, courteous and efficient when I have needed help.  The cost is reasonable.  I would recommend Bitdefender  to anyone who wants top-notch, affordable and expert computer protection."
j thomas,1,5,renewal is always efficient quick I have no problems with renewing my subscription and its fast does a very good job so far I would recommend it to anyone
Jerry Keller,1,5,CAN this BLOCK NSA peepers?????
Luly,1,4,"Bitdefender  is  the best antivirus I've purchased.  High  perfection,  quick  download,  decent  pricing. However   some features  are a little not too  easy to set up and use.  For instance, Parental Control  and many others  do not activate on auto pilot, but as soon as you  activate them,AP  disables.  Also, in Auto Pilot  you still have issues to resolve, which makes it not really automatic or worry free as claimed.  I  love Bitdefender,I just wished I was easier to use  especially for parents.  Thank you."
James,1,5,"It's worth every dollar. Having this kind of protection, all the while with out having to do anything after setup is just priceless. Go ahead, buy it."
Lee Sinclair Furniture ltd,15,4,Good price for what you get and seems to keep me free from nasties.
Larry L,5,5,I have never been infected with a virus or anything else. This is the best AV program hands down.
Jerry,2,5,Good product
ROEL CANTU,2,1,Bitdefender is not a good product.  This is the second or third time I have purchased the anti-virus program for my computers and my computers still get viruses and work very slow.  I will never purchase Bitdefender ever again.  I have to research for a new anti-virus that is dependable and affordable.
Nike,1,5,This is a first class antivirus system
Merle Lonnon MN USA,1,5,I now like the way you let me up grade my Bitdefender with just a few key strokes.So far on both our two computers laptop and desk top we have not had a problem.We have found you must be careful who you purchase Bitdefender from or it can be very expensive.
ange,2,5,I love the dashboard layout - it is so easy to use and the autopilot feature is great for the kid's PC - I don't have to remind them to scan their PC
John,1,5,The only problems I have had is in the renewal process.
lisi,1,5,Bitdefender works quietly in the background without noticeably affecting my computer speed or involving me to get rid of a virus. It's a very welcome change to what I've experienced in the past with other well known anti-virus products. The online Help is also outstanding.
Debra Williams,4,4,They are good
Hugh Melvin,5,5,"I have every confidence in BitDefender software. I have had no virus problems since it was installed and many other people I know have had computer 'break-ins' which I have avoided. The tune-up features are well worth having and I installed BitDefender on a seldom used laptop just to speed and tidy it up.When I have needed to contact BD support service it is well managed and I get a good, timely email conversation"
Werner,5,5,"Every new version has been an improvement, I run it on both Windows and OS X. It has always had very low system demand, updates frequently, NEVER bombed my OS, never let a bug pass.In a word - superb!All my family and friends are using it.Carry on the present good work."
Allan Fredericks,1,4,"The product has protected me from malicious software since first installation.I find it a bit complex to set up file inclusions/exclusions and have never been able to successfully scan password protected files.I am not a big fan of running software in auto mode but find this product too confusing to run in any other mode.I often have trouble at first boot as the os has to wait for BD to update virus definition files etc, etc.I have a 1.35TB drive of which 1.18TB is free and yet BD takes in excess of 4hrs to execute full system scan."
Stephen Hornby,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for a number of years to fully protect my systems security.  I doesn't seem to slow my computer down and works in the background without any conflicts that I am aware of.  Every time I have updated one of my computers I automatically install Bitdefender and delete whatever virus protection that is bundelled for ""free"".  I've recommended this product to dozens of friends and accociates.  Thanks for the security!"
ClientStephen Batchelor,3,5,"Bit Defender is THE Best Total Security Product I have Used Since I Have Used Computers. No Interference, No Fuss, No Hassle, It Just Does it's Job VERY Well."
Darren,2,4,Have found the program to be very effective. System scans can take while however computer is still functional while running System scans just a little slower and knowing how long they take it is easy to work around. Was unhappy with the way you could not stop the auto renewal from occurring when purchasing the program in 2012 even after following their instructions and receiving an email to say I had used the Cancel Auto Renew Subscription. Auto renewal still occurred.Purchasing again in 2013 is better as the System scans are faster.
Ehsan Vossough,2,5,"It is rated as number one and I have been using this product for several years now. Compared with other free products I have had no viruses on my PC, so I use it with confidence. Only issue may be slow start-up due to checking the system for viruses, but this a small price to pay for reliability and safety."
Donnie Crump,1,5,I have been in the industry for over 20 years and in that time I have tried them all. Once I switched to BitDefender I never looked back. Keep up the good work!
G Collins,1,5,"Have been using Bitdefender for a few years and wouldn't change. At about 75 cents a week its good value and I know it works. Is unobtrusive running in the background with sometimes updates several times a day.Support is timely and excellent.Only suggestion I'd make is that you have a total package price for Bitdefender and all the additional add-on modules, or buy them singly as you can now."
Michael Shelfer,1,5,I have tried the rest but this is the best!! Just buy it use it  and trust it.  Highly recommended!!
Richard White,1,4,"(Even though this box recommended writing as if to a friend, I should point out that I have already recommended many friends and family who have switched to Bitdefender Internet Security either upon their existing solution renewal, or from the use of 'free' solutions such as AVG).For many years I have been the 'go to' person for all things computer for my friends and family and I am usually very wary when it comes to recommending hardware or software products as a bad recommendation will generally come back to bite me. Bitdefender, however, was an easy recommendation and a success as it allowed easy use by those that aren't computer literate as well as allowing those more experienced the ability to configure it as needed. Additional optional security features such as those surrounding eCommerce and online shopping have added to the value of the overall product. I also really appreciate Bitdefender’s checking and facilitation of critical and important Microsoft / Windows updates.The only area that I discovered was not covered by Bitdefender was security concerning malware. This unfortunately was discovered the hard way and it would certainly be an area I would like to see covered in future versions of this tool (I say this assuming that anti-malware isn't already available in another Bitdefender product of which I am unaware. Even still, I would have preferred an all-in-one solution rather than having to purchase separate products.  Especially where, when recommending this to others, it is a reality the person that will need to use the software doesn't understand the difference between antivirus and anti-malware, and has no inclination to learn. They just require something that works. It is for this reason alone I did not give it the full 5 stars.)Now I play a lot of internet gaming (WoW, FC3 & BF4 multiplayer etc.) and I always used to need to manually configure my internet security firewall to open up ports as required. With Bitdefender this has not been necessary. Bitdefender’s ‘Game Mode’ looks to have intuitively configured itself for my needs and I have not noticed any connection problems (or lag, slow internet) at all.  If anything quite the opposite.  I use my broadband router’s firewall as my first line of defence and Bitdefender has seamlessly covered everything else required.In summary, I find Bitdefender Internet Security gives me constant peace of mind. It was easy to download, install and, most importantly, very intuitive to use on a day-to-day basis. The latter point being where many other mainstream system security products fall down. Quite simply, this product does what it says on the tin, simply, and clearly. Its interface is well designed and very easy to use.  A green tick for all is OK, and a red cross for action is required.  It couldn’t be simpler, unless you are my wife who systematically ignores any red crosses and numbers on her system.  If you are also concerned about malware, then I suggest looking up some (free, or low cost) anti-malware products to compliment Bitdefender Internet Security for total protection."
Neil Shields,1,5,Bitdefender remembers to contact me before my anti-virus protection runs out and they provide the very best protection available for my computer.I would not use any other.Thank you.
Bill Short,1,4,"Everything is great and the product seems to work well (I have had no virus's in 2 1/2 years), but I cannot find a way to shut off the game mode."
Petert,2,5,"have been using the product for years , got my first exposure to it from a trade show frebieI read up on it before using and it seemed good have been using it for about 8 or so years .I have never had had virus /malware etc problems .it installs easily and uninstalls easily so is easy to take a test with all up i recommend it"
ClientNorman Hart,1,4,I have been using Bit Defender for some time HOWEVER it did not block a Virus a few weeks ago and the computer went to the IT??? for repairs.This has happened previously which is discouiraging. My IT still says your product is a good one to have. But when you fail I get an account to pay
randy biskner,4,5,Best program I have ever used.:-)
Joshua,1,4,"I won't use another security system, but with that it could use work with the autopilot. Autopilot means I should not have to open it to ensure it's up to date. Several times I've opened the user interface and have to click update now after it didn't auto-update after 6 days."
Raymond Baldwin,1,5,"I had several friends that use a highly rated security suite that didn't do the job and they caught the virus OAccess. Not only did I not get hit with it, but I didn't give it a second thought. I have every confidence in bitdefender. My computer is clean and stays that way. When it comes time to renew I won't give it a second thought. All three of the computers in our home  have it and we will continue to do so."
Michael,1,5,"Starting my PC seems perfectly quick, unlike with some Antivirus programs I've used. Online, I feel totally safe - nothing has infected or affected my PC. My only gripe is trying to let the Bitdefender know that I have changed my email address. You have to OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT for god's sake. I mean, not pay again but just go through a very un-intuitive process, entering account codes etc - MY GOD!! I gave up. Lucky my old-an-otherwise-unused email address is with my ISP so will exist while I am with them. READ THIS BITDEFENDER AND SORT IT OUT!!! Apart from that small niggle, I am very happy with the protection provided."
L. Gall,1,5,"There was a computer repair shop (?) next to a Thai restaurant that I frequented.....I wandered inside one day just to ask questions about my laptop's performance and we became friends.....I would take my laptop to him whenever it acted up and after a few visits he asked what kind of virus protection did I have....I answered that I didn't know (told you, illiterate....totally).....he checked the computer somehow and learned I had no less that three different virus programs running simultaneously--which is why my computer was never working right......then he told me about Bitdefender and showed me all the great write-ups and columns that had been written in praise of ""award winning and currently the very best virus protection for the money""...I bought it, he installed it (with the ""key"" (or whatever) and my laptop has been virtually TROUBLE-FREE ever since!   The End."
Marjorie Schweizer,5,5,"Six weeks or so ago I made the mistake of downloading Window 10 to my 5 yr old computer.  My Bitdefender (BD) was removed as I assume Windows thinks they are better at protecting us.  I  downloaded BD again.  Over the coming week/10 days I discovered other items WIN 10 decided I didn't need or shouldn't have or  want.  I got rid of WIN 10.  In doing so it destroyed my BD.  It removed or corrupted pieces of BD, I could not delete the program or re-install it.  I tried for  a least a week to get BD back and got nowhere.  I contacted tech support and within 2 days they contacted me asking for a full description of what happened.  A week or so later they asked for more info and told me how to get that info from my computer and how to get it to them.  They kept in touch with me and after a couple of weeks I heard from them again.  The day before yesterday I got an email with step by step instructions and links on how to delete all the BD program on my computer and a link to completely clean it.  Then instructions to download it again.   In about an hour my Bit Defender is up and running perfectly.   Many thanks to the tech support team.  It took a while, but they did it and hopefully it will help the next person who's computer gets screwed by WIN 10."
Robsi,1,5,"My favorite features of Bitdefender is it's the highest grade protection your money can buy and it does not slow down your system speed. It is fully customizable of if your a novice you can choose the standard installation. As the complexities of computing continue to change, Bitdefender manages to stay ahead of the curve to keep you safe.I have tried several of the big name brands and none offer the speed and protection that Bitdefender has attained. I have used Bitdefender since it was first offered and never looked back. Bitdefender is fully automatic or if your like me a bit paranoid, I always run Bitdefender on boot up, then check for any windows updates. I have used my computers for financial transactions since the days of CompuServe and have never had any problems. I am very cautious and that's why I trust Bitdefender today."
Ralph,4,5,Fair priced and easy install and with enough licenses to support the home. No perceieved impact on system performance as it does its business in protecting you from internet harm from others or yourself! Have been using for years and am satisfied and confident I am as safe as I can be.  Thanks BD!
Timo,1,5,"When I went looking for a top-notch system to protect my computer, it was hard to go past what Bitdefender had to offer.  I had tried several differnet companies/products (both free and paid) in the past, most of whom let me down in one way or another. I have used Bitdefender now for several years and have not had a single issue nor complaint, even upon upgrading or updating.... always preformed flawlessly. How do I rate it? By the fact that I continue to use it after all this time and recommend it to friends."
Tom Doan,1,5,Light and flawless.don't understand wallet to well thoughOutside of that nearly perfect.
michael thompson,1,5,"good product ,  very happy with it , I will buy one again."
allan hubbert,1,5,"for me it is just install and forget, i have recommended bit defender to all my friends"
John G,1,5,"Over several years, I have found Bitdefender to be an effective and reliable protection system for my business and personal Windows-based computer systems. At no time since adopting Bitdefender, have I ever had a PC infection of any kind. I use the Bitdefender firewall rather than that of Windows and again have never had a problem. The few times I have sought advice from the Bitdefender team, they have responded quickly and resolved any issues to my full satisfaction. I can recommend Bitdefender as a well priced but very effective virus protection system."
F. Walker,1,5,I highly recommend Bitdefender Internet Security.  They have great online customer service.  Whenever I had an issue I could write to customer and get a quick satisfactory answer.
Steve Burgess,1,3,Vírus protects seems OK but absence of alerts doesn't mean good protection. Parental control reporting doesn't work as advertised and company is unresponsive to support requests
PeterC,2,3,"I've been a PAYING Bitdefender customer for years and slowly but surely we have gotten there as far as features and fixed bugs.(ever try cygwin with bitdefender???) However their support is a disaster should you ever need it but MUCH MORE important is  the business decision to automatically recharge your account on an annual basis. This is just plain intrusive and flat out WRONG, They spin it as a convenience feature. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? How does Bitdefender presume to know that I wish to renew my business with them? Plus why is it my obligation to opt-out of this deal?  If I paid for a one years membership then that is what I WANT.  I could go on and on about them but you get the idea. If you don't mind this type of business model then bitdefender is a fine AV solution. Otherwise there are many viable alternatives that don't automatically reach into your bank account.This could just be me as I have never taken well to being misled by a vendor I paid good money for their product/service.  NEVER,.   So no matter how much I like this product I probably won't renew nor ever speak well of my bitdefender experience..  One reaches a point where enough is enough.... Sad,,,"
Client rory good,1,5,"it is user friendly, it clearly shows what is going on with the system, it gives you much more control over how it works than most if you choose to do so and not high on resources usage which makes it good even for lower speed computers in all a great product ...............I love it.  I recommend it to all my computer customers and if I have any spare keys left from any copies I have purchased I install it on their system also"
steve,2,5,What a great feeling knowing that you information is safe and your machine is protected.
Client,1,3,Not bad but not the best.
Eric Torianyk,1,5,"I was skeptical when I was looking for an alternative to other anti-virus software (McAfee) that gave me lots of trouble and constantly turned off or didn't provide adequate protection, but I have to say that Bitdefender is a class of its own. It is different than most, but I do appreciate that it doesn't slow down my computer so much. it gives you plenty of options for configuring it as a normal or advanced user. It has a gaming mode that gives power back to the games I play without compromising my security. I would recommend you give it a try, at least find the good price deals and decide for yourself.You have an online dashboard that you can quickly review the protection, updates, etc.. of computers you are in control of at home for which I have plenty with the kids."
ClientJames Protho Jr,1,5,"This is the best security program I have ever had. I have tried quite a few and by far, none can compare to Bit Defender. I am so happy I choise to give it a try I have referred it to so many of my associates."
Client,1,3,good product after it was finally installed. Took  to long to install and register with bitdefender. Could not get them to register my 2. computer.
Margaret McCord,1,5,it really is good I don't get viruses or bugs it keeps things safe.
michael   gilboy,1,5,"please use bit defender , for complete please of mind about your pc  security"
Jake,1,1,"It will not allow me to set up automatic scans, it has allowed frequent virus infections, if it wasn't for the two year purchase I would switch to another protection plan."
Joe Adams,1,5,"I am a consultant who relies on predictable performance from all of my computers. Not only does Bitdefender Total Security protect my computers from viruses and malware, but it has stabilized my new  Windows 8 portable.  It finds and downloads software updates which Microsoft's Help Desk could not get the computer to find and download.  Without Bitdefender Total Security I would  not have a stable platform which would allow me to meet all of my customers' needs."
Client jeff falwasser,2,5,"Your firm does the complete job for us and we have no worries, so we just pay the account each year when its time."
wil bailey,11,4,"It's effective and, in operation, mostly doesn't intrude. I'm a bit uncertain about the benefit of the 'Wallet' feature - which is a bit intrusive and which I'm unable to turn off - and I needed the help of Support when I responded to the marketing offer to buy in early to the subsequent year's product. Taking my money again as a satisfied customer should be seamless.....Nevertheless, I'm content with the effectiveness and with the value for money. Oh, and the Support guy I dealt with was on the ball.....as one would want."
Ograf,1,5,"While it is true that I usually read many reviews on software and ratings to see what the general population thinks,  I read geek journals to understand the impact on performance, The real test is using a security program for an extended amount of time.    I wouldn't recommend anything else to anyone."
Client,1,4,Seems to work fine but downloading updates has slowed down a lot lately.
Peter,1,5,I am happy with the software as it has done well in protecting against unwanted virus.
TY in Florida,1,5,"We've tried other security programs (i.e...webroot, Norton and mcafee) which would allow Trojan virus to pass undetected."
Ken Dodson,8,4,"I have been using Bitdefender Internet Security for a number of years and have been very pleased with its unobtrusive effective security performance.  On one occasion there was a serious error caused by Bitdefender when an update caused users some serious issues, however since then (about 3 years ago) I have been delighted with the service.  Not sure I like the add ons that have crept into the product.  I like things that just do the job I want ie Internet Security protection.  Add ons such as security code storage etc I get from specialist software companies in that field.  I also don't like the little red crosses on the hub to advise you of things that need attention.  I personally don't want to interact with Bitdefender.  I just want to set it up and let it do its job"
Lesl,1,3,I have to continuously close Safe Pay whenever I do internet banking because it crashes (blue screen of death) my laptop.   Laptop is Toshiba Satellite Pro with windows 7 32 bit.
Carmen Roosme,2,5,It has protected my computer from all kinds of viruses including Trojans.
Client,1,4,"I have used Bitdefender for the last 5 years and honestly wont give the rest a try anymore. I have tried almost all of the like programs and find them coming in short of the features included in Bitdefender Internet security. The only gripe I have with the software , why I gave it 4 stars, is the price of a renew ell. Renew prices are about the same as buying the software at full price.Thank you,starpilot101st"
Garry T; Hill,1,4,WORKS GREAT EXCEPT MAL WARE
Robert Storey,1,4,Embellishments to display are quite novel but can be mortifying to customers over eighty years old. Stay with simplicity.
Ann Pellew,1,5,I haven't had any worries since using Bitdefender. It is very easy to use and it requires very little maintenance. A fantastic product that keeps up with the changes in technology
Vicente MM,1,5,It is easy to use - easy to do scans.  It is working in the background all the time and alerts you to ongoing threats.
RobW,1,5,"Why Bitdefender? Because of the seemless intergration into my Windows operating enviroment.  Bitdefender provides a high level of security which is paramount for those of us who use the internet and social media. But the most important aspect for me is that Bitdefender is does not use a lot of my computers resources, it sits quietly in the background doing what it does best."
Anton,1,5,Buying and installing Bitdefender Total Security is a breeze. It has a comprehensive suite of tools to clean & protect your pc without using heaps of resources. It is simple to use and requires little input. I have used every version since 2006 and each one gets better. I thoroughly recommended it to anyone.
Paul Grieves,1,5,Anyone thinking of Virus software - this is a great product. Sits quietly doing its protecting.
Ronald B Money,1,5,"Since first installing BitDefender on my computer, I have been totally impressed by the software. I can't tell you anything technical about it, but I can tell you that it has always kept my computer free of viruses and that's why I purchased it. It has always been one of the most competitively priced software's and it has performed almost flawlessly. Any time I've ever had a problem, I just contact Customer Service and problem solved."
L. Lawrence,1,3,"Bitdefender is a good product, the only problems I have ever had with it are from the admin staff telling me my contract will be up in a short time when I have 400 days left. The product itself is good value, and keeps the computer clean. I feel secure when I do online banking or pay bills online. It's recommended for anyone who does all their financials online"
Delbert,1,5,Very reliable. runs using very little Recourses in the back ground. Have to say I've never needed tech support so its hard to comment on that. in my opinion that's a GOOD thing though. 12 + years of Loyalty from one Happy costumer.
Mark Carli,1,5,"The product is easy to use, with a good graphic user interface."
Majordis,2,5,"I have used many anti-virus / security programs over the years & have found none as unobtrusive as Bit Defender. I'm sure all the top security programs are similar, but BD is easiest to configure & disable the featurs you don't want"
Client,1,1,"I'd hear nothing but good reviews on this product so I figured I'd give it a shot, the price didn't hurt either. Big mistake! Now there's a virus on my computer that I can't get off, Bitdefender doesn't even register that it exists."
Client Louis A. Vigil,1,5,I really feel safe with the protection you provide. Your programs are so-o simple to understand.Bitdefender...like a baby in the mother's arms.
Lou Boehlein,1,4,I love the protection but the new interface is complicated. I liked the old one much better. This one also crashes a lot (I run Vista).
Daz,6,4,"Never let me down yet & they reward loyalty which not all AV products do! Been with them for 3 years & i would always recommend BitDefender. Reason for only 4 & not 5 stars is that i missed the early renewal offer of my subscription by 2 days so i was required to pay the full price!! I was shocked, i thought they reward loyalty & my current subscription still had 60 days left! So the early renewal offer still should have applied but after speaking to a very accommodating person who also saw it my way, i was able to get my renewal at just £1.50 more than the offer that had expired 2 days earlier. Always take the early renewal offer as its a no brainer at less than 1/2 price! Very good product, minimal resources are used & the safepay method is an excellent way of fighting keylogging. 9/10."
Fred Moroney,3,5,"Very reliable, never had a virus problem in over 3 years. Highly recommended."
Scott Gross,1,5,"Get BitDefender. I've been using it for a few years now and have never had a problem with infections, spam, phishing or bad cookies and I go to a lot of places on the internet  (maybe some where I shouldn't). BitDefender keeps you from going where you don't want to go and where you can get into trouble."
Richard,1,1,I have had to remove Bitdefender from two of my PC's as it was causing them to crash. Not a single crash since I unloaded Bitdefender
Nigel Cox,6,5,"Product  is easy to use and very reliable.If problems are encountered, the company is easy to communicate with, quick to reply, honest in their replies and quick to fix issues.  If there is a problem they will admit it and work for a fix very quickly.  (Previous experience of both McAfee and Norton resulted in denials and poor service.)"
Archie Greves,17,5,I've used bitdefender for years I wouldn't change gives me total confidence online .
H.R.,1,5,Bitdefender works well for me but Avangate hastime and time again bothered me to renew evenwhen I had more than a year left to go.
Zakari T.,1,4,The total security version is the best of its kind...
Wayne Skilton,1,5,"Bit defender has the tools to defend ones computer while surfing, banking and downloading large files. It has the tools to Spring clean your computer, thus restoring fast dependable computing."
Client,1,4,Great protection that offers better system compatibility and performance over my other favorite Internet Security brand.Only concern is low firewall scores at Matousec so I only use it on my desktop system (and I'm pleased with it) and not a laptop used without a NAT router.
Ian Taylor,1,5,"Simply put, the best AV software currently on the market. It covers all of your security needs in one go."
Kevin Frankel,1,5,I started using Bitdefender antivirus after Norton allowed two serious virus infections within two weeks.  These were so bad - I had to recovery my complete operating system from backups.  I was so aggravated with Norton.  After doing some looking - I found that Bitdefender was rated number 1 or 2 on several sites.  I thought I would give it a try.  It's been great.  I've had ZERO infections with Bitdefender.  The Bitdefender user interface has steadily improved over the years and is very user friendly.  I have recommended Bitdefender Antivirus to numerous friends.
Client Steve Doherty,6,5,This package is easy to use you just let it run in the background and your safety is attended to by bitdefender
"Bill D, NEW SOUTH WALES",1,5,"We have been running this software for a couple of years now and are very happy with its performance. Currently we are using over 20 licences and viruses are not affecting our systems like the old software use to. This software can be quite cheap providing you Google and find your cheapest on seller. Bitdefender them selves, to purchase the software off are too expensive so use an on seller. We don’t know why that is but as long as there are on sellers we don’t care. Home user will find great deals on 3-5 licence product deals. Our company only uses Bitdefender virus software so we can’t make comments on any other products."
John A. Wallace,1,5,"Easy to use, it does everything for you, with added highlights of safebox etc. there is no other product on the market that I can see that competes with Bitdefender."
Trish Sparkfield Client,5,5,"I'm no technical computer expert so to be able to click to download and leave it running on autopilot, knowing I'm safe from the bugs, is the ideal antivirus programme for me. A friend, who is a computer genius, recommended it several years ago and I've not used another since then, and, as it happens, had no problems with viruses, spam, pop ups etc.What more could you ask for?"
David Butler,1,5,"extremely effortless, manages entire network automatically. discounted renewals are a bonus. Never had an issue or concern in the 3 years as a customer."
Larry Le Starge,3,5,"I've been using BitDefender for over 5 years and have had nothing but perfect performance the entire time.  The additional features to BitDefender, for example, Tune Up, make it an exceptionally versatile software."
Patricia Dunne,1,5,"Quietly works in the background without slowing down my computer, never had any problems with it in the many years I have been using it. Efficient and cheap - what more can you ask!"
Client Larry Millspaugh,3,5,"I've been in the Computer Industry all my life, Bitdefender provides the most pro ductive system on my laptop! Thank you Bitdefender for delivering a marvelous product worth the money,"
Amanda,1,5,The product is great and even proactively finds and quarantines viruses as they pop up.  However the newer versions aren't as user friendly as the previous ones.
Aubrey,2,5,"That's the way I feel--free to NOT think about security. Bitdefender symbolically tells me--""I got this Mr. Roberts."" I love that. Knowing how safe I feel in addition to the facts--rated #1 by Top Ten Reviews, and rated top-tier by CNET reviews--well--it's a ""no brain-er"". All that protection for such a competitive price. Thanks Bitdefender. You are--the strongest link!!"
Trish,1,2,Just haven't been happy with it
Joe Venezia,1,5,"Easy to use, have no problems ,"
Dale,2,5,The product is very easy to use and very user friendly. I have it on all my computers and my family purchased it for theirs too.
Sébastien,1,5,"I've been using BitDefender on 3 PCs since 2008 and haven't been infected since then. Before with McAfee and Norton, on those same PCs, I had to format at least twice a year."
Chris,1,5,Excellent firewall and scan with redy updates. Great Game setting for online gaming.
Robert B Millar,1,5,"Had one problem, I wiped my Trading HDD clean remotely, thinking I was cleaning the Registry, Cookies, etc.. Language difference. Your ""Wipe Clean"" means to Format the HDD. That was a big ""OOOPS"" moment. In the USA, to clean means to remove the dirt, trash, whatever, not to burn the furniture. However, it was my mistake and a good cleaning allowed me to make those small changes I was never getting around to doing.There is a learning curve most retail customers will not travel."
John Paul Locklear,2,5,Bitdefender is rated #1 for a reason and I have never been disappointed. After downloading set Bitdefender in autopilot mode. It will let u know when u need to update a program and when encounters a virus. Hassle free.
Donna Tomlinson,2,3,I had already renewed my Total Security package because I was told that my current subscription was about to end. Today I got an email saying that I would be auto renewed. This does not help with trust.
Mr Snowdon,12,5,"Well worth the money complete security at all levels ALL the time, thank you."
Mark Antell,1,5,"Installing could be a challenge for those without computer savvy, could make it better in that regard."
Dennis,1,5,
William Sweeting,2,3,"It`s been a sort of up and down three years.  It hasn`t gotten better each year as the one i`m using at the moment uses all the resources when updating and so everything else slows down to a crawl.   I`ve had a few times when I have had to reboot the computers because Bit Defender isn`t working, this didn`t happen with previous versions. I would have given it more stars but for the constant checking that it`s still working properly."
micheal cole,1,4,I do recommend this security system to my friends.I do not need to sell them this.
Bruce Wilson,1,4,
Tressa Randolph,1,5,"I've used BitDefender for years now.  I can always rely on the program to run quietly in the background without slowing down my system.  I have never had an occurrence of computer infection while I had BitDefender installed and running on my system.  The Game Mode is also handy.  I have been using new features as well, such as Anti-theft and ID Protection, and am happy with them thus far."
keith,4,5,To buy direct is very exspensive even if you have been a customer for a long time you must shop around the states are a good place! damm fine product
Jim Ord,12,5,Have used Bitdefender for several years without any major issues. It runs seamlessly in the background without apparently affecting computer speed and on the very rare occasions I have asked for customer support it has been promptly and comprehensively delivered.First class product & service.
Peter ConwayClient,1,5,It would be good to have a few more tools to improve PC performance.
Jim G,1,1,The above statement says it all
Elisa Gonzalez,6,5,"I have had Bitdefender Security products for many years now.  In that time, I have had to contact them only a couple of times mostly about questions I had about the product.  I absolutely love that they are always available by phone contact as nothing substitutes for human contact when you have questions and are in a hurry.Superb product that has never failed me.  Superb customer service that has been invaluable when I needed it (rarely, I might add!)."
J. Mike Palmere,2,3,My time with bit defender has been very good until one of my computers got a virus and when I E-mailed bit defender to see if it could be fixedalmost a weel later all I got from them was this survey..You figure it out.........!
Mark,1,5,"Bitdefender works efficiently in the background on my computers without noticeable slowing or resource hogging.  Provides an excellent toolbag to assist with maintaining computer operations safely and efficiently.  Perhaps most important for me is that whenever I have needed tech assistance it has been accessible and very helpful.  I want piece of mind and insurance with no worries.  I get that from Bitdefender, which is why I am a long-term customer"
Manuel,2,5,"Great product , simple, fast download, overall my antivirus"
John McCrea,1,5,"As a multi license Bitdefender customer of over five years, I can attest to the high level of product performance and customer support that sets this company apart from all other PC and Network protection providers. If you want peace of mind, try Bitdefender Total Security. You will not regret making the move!"
Marvin Fogel,1,5,"I had other software programs that protected my computer, but Bitdefender, by far, is the best one I've had.  Thanks to you.A loyal subscriber"
j cooke,2,3,"Installing the new version last month on my windows 7 64 bit pc, bricked the pc.   I had to do a clean windows 7 install from scratch, which takes some time. Then restore all my software before trying again.  On the clean install it worked fine but there is some sort of issue with versions of win 7 that have been updated over time."
Stephen Craig,4,5,Had it for some time now and had no issues at all.
Jim Brown  bustertoad,1,5,"The program does what it is supposed to do and does it with out being intrusive. A big plus.  There are a few small things that could be looked at.  I found it difficult to reschedule my weekly scan to occur at a time when I do not need to use my computer. I tried several times but it always seems to default back to a different time that I requested. I can work around it so it is no big deal; just something I wanted to mention, since you asked.  It is too difficult/complicated to install on the second computer so I gave up and run a generic program on that system.Overall I am please with what I have as long as the price stays good. JB"
Stephen Runkle,1,5,"BitDefender has been my choice of PC protection for several years. I love the fact that I can install it and forget it, while knowing it is always watching out for me."
Eric D.,1,4,"This is the first virus software I've owned and I've had many that doesn't ""bully"" your system into doing what the software wants to do WHEN it wants to do it....and of course that's usually at the most inopportune time....truly works in background without being a processor code bully....it just plain does what its supposed to do and it does that great...!!"
Client,1,5,"I tried Bitdefender, not really expecting anything different from the my previous security suite, and Wow, it was like comparing chalk and cheese.  Bitdefender really does do what it says on the tin.  Just install it and forget it.  I never suffer from slowdowns or problems of any sort, not like I used to before I switched!"
Client,2,5,"Great product.  I haven't had a single issue with trojans, viruses since I became a subscriber to Bitdefender."
Curt Seal,2,4,"Antivirus keeps defaulting to OFF... reported to BD... their response does not work.. I wish that BD would repair the Software, so that this problem is fixed.."
Bit Defender Internet Security 2013,1,5,No infections in over 5 years what more can i say.
Colin,1,4,"Generally happy - works quietly in the background, needs little input from me"
Cath Davies,8,5,I've used Bitdefender Total Internet Security for about 10 years.  In that time it's caught a handful of viruses but my PC has never been infected.  It works well and doesn't slow up my system.
Gareth B,6,5,"Easy to install and use but with detailed configuration, behind the simple user interface, if you need it.A comprehensive suite of tools there when you need them. But most importantly, once installed you can pretty much forget about it. It works and updates behind the scene.The bugs (compatibility issues) of previous versions have, as far as I can see, been eliminated."
Rob Pierce,1,5,When any of my friends and family ask me for advice on which security product to use I always recommend BitDefender. It runs silently for the most part and is not at all as intrusive as other products I have tried in the past. The Game Mode is a great feature that I use on a daily basis.
Tricia V,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for many years now. No matter what the product I am using, it has been excellent threat detection and protection. I work on a Mobile Sports Broadcast truck and when we had a problem with our Graphics generator, we contacted IT for that manufacturer for help. They were completely stumped and tried several different virus protection programs to try and eliminate the issue. None worked and could not even find the problem until I suggested we try using Bitdefender. First scan after installation and Bitdefender was able to identify and eradicate the culprit files! We have run Bitdefender on the machines ever since."
Gary,1,5,"the only issue I have ever had was during installation when upgrading from previous versions. Instructions not clear and could be much better. First version of current version software had bugs and maybe version wasreleased too early. Once bugs where taken care of, program installed correctly and has functioned flawlessly on Windows Vista and Win7 machines. I only use BitDefender will only use BitDefender until they let me down"
Neal W,2,5,"Works brilliantly, not memory hungry or intrusive."
Daniel,2,5,"Bitdefender is awesome.  It provides great protection with very little taxing of resources.  It is easy to run.  I does not invade your privacy by having to verify your IP every time you turn on your computer.  It provides great feedback  and seems to have the best detection protocols.  I could not be happier with this product.   In fact, I use it on 6 computers (two 3 license packages) and on my tablet and smartphone with the free app.  I recently renewed and I expect to renew again and again.  Get it , you will love it."
mark,3,5,had good experience with BD... Been a happy customer for more than 3 years now...
brian rhodes,3,4,"if you actually ""treasure"" my opinion why do I need to use a catchy header. the only problem I have with you folks is that you are hard to reach when I have a problem. bought your product several years ago after my computer was hi-jacked and I sent viargra ads to my three older sisters, my boss and my children."
Client,2,3,"I used this product for over a year and loved it.  But, after downloading some new chess software, I could not get the two programs to work together.  Bitdefender had to go and the chess software stayed.  Running Kaspersky."
Frank V Caputo,1,3,"As long as you do not need to speak to a REAL person, you will like the program.  But if you are technologically challenged like me and need to contact someone to walk you thru a problem, GOOD LUCK. I tried for 2 weeks to reach someone and finally gave up after constantly being guided to a ""written"" solution which meant absolutely nothing to me."
Brad,1,4,"Does the job without causing  problems.    Only small issue is it occasionally turns off; ""B"" turns black, indicates reboot needed.     May be connected with MS updates."
Client Bill W,2,5,I have been using Bitdender since it came out.  BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET!Have recommended and installed on many system and NEVER had to go back to fix a virus that slipped through.Keep up the great work!
Scott Pallets,1,3,"I think the older version worked better for our office because it was always working in the  background. Unseen and flawless. The newer version seems to want to protect you more, but pops up here and there in the middle of work and just becomes plain irritating. It is also a bigger file and have still had issues installing it on older computers. I believe AVG Free would work just as well and there is a free version."
ClientPatrick and Julie Andreas,1,5,Out side of the fact that you said we will get and extra months for us being with you soo longg and didnt get  it You Protect us with the best posible team we could ask for
Steve Gore,2,5,
Mihai Barbu,1,5,I will try do not change it.
Stephen,2,5,"This is the best antivirus, computer protection I ever used, scans complete, blocks sites, and removes viruses. I also love the computer cleanup and other options I would highly recommend."
B. Farmer,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for more than 5 years and have watched it grow and simplify in use each year. Download it, a few simple setup options and let it go! It is that easy! I do alot of downloading that without Bitdefender would wreak havoc on my system. It keeps my pc virus free and even helps keep it a bit cleaner and running smooth. I use it on my Android as well with the same results,I work on peoples computers on the side and reccommend it to all of them, especially to those that I have to remove viruses from.Keep up the good work!"
Client,2,4,I've used Bitdefender for several years and I'm pretty happy with it. I did recently renew a little early with a special offer and I lost the remaining month of my subscription.
Client,1,5,"I have been using your products for years now and have recommended them to my friends and family.   You guys are great, please keep up the good work."
Richard,1,4,It does it's job well.  The only problem I had with it previously was it's slowness but the latest release has addressed that problem.
terry,5,4,Have used BD for many years on two desktops and one laptop. Very pleased with the base product and all ofits improvements. Recomend it to many friends who have also used it. LIke the fact that if a licence is renewed all of the remaining time is carried forward.
David Jennings,2,4,"A security product such as Bitdefender should be virtually invisible most of the time, not slowing down the system or constantly creating annoying messages.  One reason we changed from the last product was the barrage of pop ups that had to be acknowledged as the product term neared expiration.  Bitdefender works well and is minimally disruptive to our real task of running the business"
Khongor,1,5,I've been using BitDefender for more than 2 years and no issue so far. Scans fast and doesn't slow my PC down.
Terry Barlow,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender for many years now and I'm always impressed with the improvements they continue to make. It's progressed to the point that I only rarely have to deal with any internet security issues. I've never been infected with a virus since I started using Bitdefender.A problem I've had in the past has been while updating from one version to the next. It used to be troublesome uninstalling, installing, and then registering the product. But even that process has been improved, and no longer seems to be an issue"
David White,1,5,I have never had a system failed.
PR TEK,1,5,I have tried the rest but Bitfender is simply the best
russell logan,10,5,used bitdefender for some time now and i have never had any trouble with this works in the background smart easy all in one
Client,1,5,Very Efficient and quick
olanr1,2,4,"otherwise, i don't have any viruses i know of."
John D.Client,1,4,Renewals should be around $15 like your other competitors that want to keep their existing customers rather than finding a new customer base.
Client,1,4,"I have enjoyed the Bitdefender because it is easy to use and way cheaper than Nortons, etc."
Jeff Drake,1,3,"I've used Bitdefender for several years and have been happy with it. It's much better than McAfee or Norton. And then suddenly in the past few months I started getting these large, intrusive, pop-up ads coming out of nowhere, asking me if I want to upgrade (or words to that affect). I like to game, and these ads literally blow my game out of the water, forcing it to minimize on my screen and look at the damn ad! I lost over an hour of game effort the other day because of this!So I complained to Bitdefender and explained the issue. What I got back was an email from their Support telling me that Bitdefender sees its ""emergency messaging"" system as an important mechanism for communicating serious problems to customers (again, words to that effect). I wrote them back and said that I did not think any advertisement warranted an ""emergency"" message of any kind, ever. Sad to say, but I will be shopping around their competition before I resubscribe again."
Selwyn Lewis,11,5,I particularly like the continuous monitoring from the moment the computer is switched on. Also when one has not been on line for a while I like the red and amber warning being displayed to indicate that a scan will be performed.
Claude J Poole,1,4,I have been using BD for some years now and it kept my computer well protected until recently. It is great to be able to speak to customer service 24/7  but logs requested to trouble shoot problems are sent to a lab for analysis and can take weeks till you get the results.  It's really too bad that everything goes well until you have a problem. That's why only 4 stars.
Client  Geoff Kay,1,4,Works very well but noticeably slower than previous version.Windows vista 32 DesktopWindows 7 i3 LaptopAnd windows 8 i3 Laptop
Don Barski,1,3,"I know not every virus can be stopped, but one got through and infected IE 9 and my screen."
Dave Cotton,1,5,Best ani-virus program on the market...
"Steve Kmiec, Green Bay, WI",2,4,I absolutely love the product. My college aged son recommended Bit Defender to me and he's 100 x's more knowledgeable about this sort of stuff than I am. I've renewed my license twice. The only negative is it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to talk to a real person in Customer Service. My last renewal was for a 3 PC version. All three PC's had active BD licenses in place when the renewal was purchased. Two extended  fine but one did not receive full credit for the existing license. We opened a Support Ticket but did not receive full satisfaction. I requested a name and phone number to resolve this in a phone conversation to no avail. This can be VERY frustrating!
Gary,1,5,"Does everything they say it will do - efficiently, stealthily, and very easy to install/use....I have found no faults!"
Steve Taylor,1,2,I was persuaded to renew my subscription early to take advantage of an offer but that is when the problems started. First of all although I had approximately 2 months left on my existing licence that was not added when I took out a subscription on the new product. I complained on several occasions but unfortunately their customer service team were very poor as in most cases their grasp of the English language was inadequate and it was clear that their replies were scripted and did not address my complaints. Eventually after 3 or 4 requests for a refund they got the message and gave me my money back. I have since been using the free Microsoft Security Essentials which is just as good.
Mary,1,5,Used Norton and got a virus and had to pay $90 to remove it.  Got Bitdefender.  NO VIRUSES and helpful techs if I ever need it.  I recommend it to everyone and get the 3 pack so both of my kids also use it.
Quinn J,1,5,"I can honestly say that I have never had any virus related problems ever since I switched to bitdefender. The best part is the interface is so easy to use and the customer support has never let me down. Every once in a while they will show a security report to show you what was blocked and things were handled. It updates it's self silently and on occasion prompts you that it needs to restart the computer. I have been a customer for for over 4 years now, never have been disappointed."
Thomas Davies,1,5,"A first class service, keep up the security I find it the best I have used"
Client,1,3,Getting slower to us maybe look at other products
Daniel O'Connor,1,5,"I have used many brands of anti-virus over the last 25 years and Bitdefender is the best I have ever used.  Smooth operation, easy configuration.  And when I did have issues, like when Bitdefender was blocking a webpage I knew was OK, tech support was right there to help.  The only problem I have had involved a case where someone was trying assigned a port to an infrared camera and Bitdefender wouldn't let it do it.  So this person uninstalled Bitdefender so he could use Windows firewall but that too no longer could be configured.  So there may be some inflexibility issues with Bitderfender.  Otherwise I have recommended Bitdefender to many friends and clients.  Keep up the good work.  Dan O'Connor"
MVorsburgh,1,5,
David Dickenson,4,4,"2nd Version of this e-mailI have just one (now 2 reservation(s)).  on installing an updated version, the program threw up a warning under vulnerability to say I had a weak password when logging into my PC on start-up. I sent an e-mail to ask the minimum requirements for a strong password, but didn't even receive an acknowledgement, never mind an answer. I was less than impressed with this on a quite important issue.Otherwise you would have received a rating of 5 stars!I do have one other gripe! I seem to get reminders that my subscription is about to expire WHEN IT ISN'T.Two years I pannicked and paid for an update that was far too early (at 500+ days) last time. Your admin appears very weak on this front and needs some special attention. I think, though I'm not sure that the figure ant the bottom of the Dashboard? is still overstating my remaining cover. I don't know if I can change it or not, but wouldn't know how if I knew the correct figure.Surely this figure comes directly from you!ThanksDavid dickenson"
Norm Whitted,1,3,Your product has been providing good protection on all of my computers.  I am getting unsolicited pop-ups every day that ask me to renew my subscription. My subscription is up-to-date and I do not want these pop-ups any more.  Please check your records more carefully before sending these annoying messages to customers who have already paid you for your services.
Client Steve,1,4,"Bitdevender causes less slowing of my computer than the other anti-virus software.I have used several of the top rated anti-virus packages over the past fifteen years and this is the most friendly and complete package.  Even when I received a call from MS, actually a fraudulent call, stating that I had a fatal error, the Bitdefender support team ran a scan and analyzed it.  They found nothing wrong.  The caller was trying to get my credit card info...."
Client,1,4,Like everything about the service except that I find the renewal process to be a little glitchy.  We have gotten emails telling us its time to renew when we have already renewed and have 400 days left.  The fact that you don't pay bit defender but another company in the middle is a little confusing too.   The only other input is that its not clear what you should do with quarantined viruses that keep recurring (delete etc.)
Thomas Jay Hill,1,5,"Bitdefender is so effective that I no longer spend  time worrying about any kind of viral infection. The whole operation seems to be run very efficiently, and I would not consider changng my anti-viral coverage. That said, the rnewal process seems cumbersome, and I wish it were possible to renew for more than one year at a time Again, great job!"
John Tyler,5,3,"Bitdefender in it's earlier days seemed to be more user friendly and intended fro the home user. The GUI is getting cluttered with many choices that seem too technical for the home user and it's hard to find what you are looking for, I wish it had a simple interface so if I had to turn off the antivirus I wouldn't have to did done to find that choice. I just purchased a new computer and it came with one year of McAfee and that has an interface meant for a home user not an IT GURU."
Beverly Chaffee,1,4,"I think it is a very good system, have had no problems with it at all. I feel completely safe with this product."
G.R.,1,5,Have used many av's but this one over the past 8 yrs is the best.
Charles Southerland,1,4,"Nothing is perfect.  All very good products have some featurethat I personally have difficulty working with.  However, whentaken as a whole, Bitdefender meets my needs better thanother top rated products.This is why I continue to use it, and recommend it to my friends."
Brian Gibson,1,4,I am generally very satisfied but why can't I play any video of any description.  I have to access Windows Explorer for this!
ctliddy,1,5,We've used Bitdefender for some years now and have had no trouble using it.  It has proved totally reliable.
Ron Anderson,1,5,Used every other security software out there before and always had issues. Went to bit defender never had an issue or security problem. You won't be sorry using their software I'll be a lifetime customer it's that good!
Douglas G. Werner,1,4,"For the most part, I believe Bitdefender is as good as or better than most other antivirus and network programs.  I have, on occasion, found some issues which were handled by Bitdefender but were somewhat difficult to understand.  The options are many, and yet, I feel some of the options should have more choices.I would feel confident in recommending Bitdefender to anyone, especially since it can be run with as little intrusion as possible, without giving up any protection."
Thomas Whittington,4,5,"Everything works well and is easy to understand, my only qualm is how well it performs with those viruses that piggy back the antivirus and destroy system restore registry ,also the location on some devises on the mobile app"
Gati K Meher,1,5,I got what I wanted. And identity theft was great addon. Thank you.
Jack Dobric,1,5,"I have run Bitdefender for several years after it was suggested by a government computer tech.  I don't believe the quality of service and program can be beat.  Thank you, Bitdefender."
Client peter,2,5,"i just keep it on autopilot and i don't have to do anything- bitdefender updates, scans, and realtime protects without me having to worry about anything. no need to schedule anything. gotta love the simplicity-it would be for nothing if it didn't give me top shelf protection. bitdefender does more than any other security suite i have owned -it works."
Dan Payment,1,5,"I've been using BitDefender now for about 2 years, and it truly is the best I've found thus far. System overhead is significantly lower than with other antivirus software I've used, even under full scans, my PC barely slows down.Also, the extra tools and utilities included with BitDefender make it more than worth the price!Please keep up the great work!"
Mike Shakespeare,9,4,"Bitdefender mostly does what it says on the box, but there are some irritating little glitches which cause it to shut down other services, such as gmail, for no good reason.  It also makes registry changes which Registry Mechanic reports as registry errors that cannot be repaired.  Most recently it missed a virus which fortunately SpyBot picked up.  Overall, it is probably better than most although on balance Kaspersky seems better but in my case not so much better as to be worth changing.  I would rate it as one of the two best anti virus agents around, you pays your money and takes your choice."
W. J. Schneider,1,3,"I have used Bitdefender for several years. It does a great job doing what it does, but over that period it has become an increasingly greedy resource hog. The software/operating files have grown to the point where it conflicts with the loading and operation of other resident programs. 30% of my boot-up is bit defender loading and scanning files that it has already vetted. I started using Bitdefender because it functioned well and ran in the background. That is no longer the case!In addition, it constantly conflicts with my web browser (Firefox) and has on more than one occasion locked up and forced a hard reboot.I personally, don't like the new console it is tedious and slow. In addition, i do not feel that there is adequate personal control over scan scheduling and other settings. It is not very intuitive for the average computer user.Will I keep using it, yes, for now! Unless I find an equal or better program that utilizes fewer computer resources and doesn't shout ""Here I am, look at me protecting you. Do you see me, huh, do you?"" then I will continue using it."
Adam Nevins,1,5,"As a owner of a PC repair and building company , I trust only 1 internet security to put on my customers PC , and that's Bit Defender .. The only complaint I get is that when they play games , the Game Mode banner doesn't appear so they know it is on. I told them it does just behind the 3D application window ,that is why they can't see it..  They all would rather see some type of notification that it is in fact working .. Safe box is probably is something that you could discontinue ,to complicated for average user ,also with cloud ,and external back ups it is a obsolete function anyway .. Those are my only two criticisms ... Great Product !"
Shivakumar Janardhanan,2,5,The antivirus protection is effective and works in the background. The major plus is that it does not cause issues in the performance of other software that is installed on the system. There were no Compatibility issues with other software installed in the system
Andrzej,1,5,"very good program, probably stay with him foreverSuper contact support almost immediate help"
Jacqueline Mauer,1,5,Bitdefender is the best Security I have ever used.  No problems since I have installed it.
Daniel J Kessler,1,1,"I get the email saying to update for $19.95, so I do. And then I get charged $49.95. This is my last renewal."
P Mendes,1,5,I have used various AV and this product is by far the best.  Easy installation and very minimal perfromance hits on my Win7 x64 system with 4gb ram.Have yet to be hit with undetected malware.Only complaint is the changing in pricing offers. Some offers are high and some are very reasonable.
"Michael H. Welbourn, Reno Nevada",1,3,"I chose Bitdefender as I keep myself updated on the latest of virus protection and what is perceived by PC Magazine and other computer rags and peoples opinions to be the best?  I have been using computers since the late 70's from the Commodore through all of Windows adventures into the unknown as was with Vista to now using Windows 8.  I was a Norton fan for years, but it buries itself so deep in a system it becomes useless. I have never liked Mcafee virus protection and have paid tons of dollars for the use of Kaspersky of which I liked until it went bonkers. One might ask what one expects out of a virus protection. That is but a simple request and resolve.I want a virus protection you don't need a degree in engineering to understand or use. I would like to navigate through it and be able to figure out why it is not doing what it is suppose to do or work at my request. I would like to be able to schedule it without calling 911 for wanting to kill it (Being facetious). I run Bitdefender in three of my home computers, yes that is silly having three, two XP's of which I love, but soon the support will end depending on which XP you have. Then there is Windows 8 that I would in a heart beat throw in the garbage can had I not paid so much, my fault, no one else's!  Windows attempt to mimic Mac was a mistake and should have never ventured into that arena. They should have improved XP the most user friendly of all Windows system and that comment in-compass's that lack of user friendly in Bitdefender Total Security of which I am running. My education, work associates and friends tells me that I am NOT of average intelligence and am an over achiever, anal more or less. You can have all the smarts in the world, but it appears I am lacking in common sense if I am unable to make Bitdefender Total Security work for me, or figure it out as it seems to be lacking in the options I would like. Those options would to be make it work for me. Now on the other side of the coin for reasons I cannot explain, I like the product, AGAIN WHY, I could not give you a clue for whatever reasons as a snow balls chance in hell, I don't know!"
MR ANTHONY W KEFFORD,8,5,You dont know its there and its doing its job
Clientjames wheelock,1,2,This year is my third with bitdefender. First year went great. 2nd year I got a virus that I ended up having to get a free trial from someone else to get rid of it. bitdefender did not find it and I couldn't get them to listen to my problem. The tech said all I had to do was reset my computer. And now my 3rd version of bitdefender  seems to think it needs to report every cookie as a virus. I've had to delete these one at a time everyday. Sometimes over 25 cookies in one day. I doubt if I do version 4 next year.
jem mann,3,4,Great program i have been kept safe and virus free unfortunately the program is marred by it's over verbose and intrusive notifications.Simple interface marred by continually drawing attention to things it's doneI don't need to know that it's been updated or scanned my computer unless I ask for it.I do not have a password on my windows for speed but evry bloody time it keeps telling me my password is weakI know I like it like that!!!!!! let me turn off the bloody notifications!!!
John Maurer,1,5,"I've been using Bitdefender  for several years now and although it was great initially,it just keeps getting better.Both antivirus and firewall features have kept me safe.The autopilot mode plus automatic updating mean I have to do NOTHING.Worry and hassle-free protection:What could be better than that?!"
Bill,1,5,"I was a long-time user of a competitive product - but finally had enough of the interminably intrusive updates, scans and notifications.  Bitdefender protects my computer fully and does not interrupt my activities.  It's definitely a win - win."
Client,2,5,You should get this product I have been using it for three years without any issues.
Jack L. Miller,2,5,"In any merchandise or product, we are all searching for something that functions well, and is easy on the wallet.  That is why I personally continue to purchase renewals with Bitdefender.   In the past, I've paid more for less protection.  Since I've starting using this product, I've virtually forgotten about my computer protection, etc.   It's comparable to turning on your home alarm system when leaving the house. Whenever I stop by the computer shop, I always say ""thanks for suggesting Bitdefender""."
Joel,1,4,"Having utilized BitDefender for our company for many years, we have been very pleased with it's ability to detect and prevent threats. However, particularly with the latest iteration, it has become much harder (sometimes impossible) to configure its settings and actions to meet our needs. BitDefender seems to have adopted the philosophy of other well-known technology companies that they know what's best for us. I would prefer that you have an ""automatic"" setting for those who don't know (or want to know) the details, but allow greater freedom of choice/configuration for those who prefer to ""tweak""."
Client,2,5,Before BitDefender my wife frequently asked for help understanding messages from her antivirus (the most widely distributed free one).  Now with BD I haven't heard a peep out of her.  We also haven't had any malware.
Walt L.,2,5,I tried the new 2014 internet security and was very surprised at all of the features it offered. I usually compare and try other beta securities and this Bitdefender  was the best of the lot for 2014.
Joseph Penna,1,3,Completely satisfied until I have to deal with the safepay feature.
Rawdawgy,1,5,"Buy it, I found that this is the best anti virus program I have ever experience, and I repair computers professionally."
Leon Moe,1,3,Recently lost my key to setup Bitdefender on 2nd computer at home.  I sent an email asking how to get the info.  I jumped through all the hoops and ended up with nothing helpful.  There is no phone number to call and speak with someone.  Sucks!
RONALD BLAKE,1,5,PRODUCT IS EASY TO USE AND INSTALL
Client,2,5,"This program has been a real godsend for me in that it is easy to use, runs in the background and does not slow down the PC while using the browser.  Its toolbox offers everything you really need to keep your PC running well and keep the clutter to a minimum."
Martha in Michigan,1,5,Three years of BitDefender has given me superior protection while I'm out surfing the Web and superior protection against intruders entering my system.Advertisements for Norton and McAfee make me laugh like reading a blonde joke .
bigdaddybwb3,4,4,"It works good with little intrusion or without bothering every time I'm doing something on the computer.  The only thing that bothers me is when I'm trying to view contents of disk or watch a disc based movie, it wants to scan the dang thing before I can access it.  Which is good from a security/virus standpoint if you're accessing files from someone else's computer but not dvd/blue ray movies.  I always end up having to stop the scan, so I can pull it up in my media player.  The only other erk I have with it is using on multiple computers i.e. work/home/mobile, you have to link all to one common account or setup separate accounts for all of them. This is sometimes difficult/aggravating when setting up computers to be used in office setting and having to go back and manage them if create different accounts."
Peter Ellis,1,5,Always found it to be reliable product and have renewed for another year.
Don Kirby,1,5,"I have had bitdefender for over 4 years and never a problem if there is they always are there to help,Thanks much Bitdefender"
Martin Robinson,4,5,"I have stayed with Bitdefender ever since I did my thorough research for the best complete package in anti-virus and total security control for the internet and I haven't looked back once. I have successfully recommended Bitdefender to family members, friends and colleagues who have all stayed with it too. You can be as geeky as you like with it, some days I want to explore my system and configure every little part of it, the next I just want to leave it on AutoPilot and just get on to playing games and doing my work (in that order!) Since I have been with Bitdefender I have not had ONE virus or problem with getting any dirty files on my computer, not with that security guard watching over me - Thanks Bitdefender, keep up the good work!!!"
Kevin Simecek,1,4,"I have used Bitdefender for several years.  As long as you do not have a need to use customer service or tech support, you are going to love the product.  Full Disclosure:  I've only had to use tech support once in the past five years, and same with my father whom I recommended the software to a couple of years ago.  Both interactions with Tech Support were pretty abysmal.  However, last contact with them was two years ago, so that could have improved by now."
jfb1138,1,5,"I've been very pleased with the performance of Bitdefender over the past several years. The program functions as advertised, updates itself effortlessly, and provides good protection against things inserting themselves into my PC system without my permission."
Rolando,1,4,Long time user. No complaints. I just wonder if my pc is truly protected. Does your software monitor every malicious or potentially threatening process?
Client Terry Barnes,3,5,"Great product, my only reservation is when you come to renew, there is no direct  link to renew in one click, takes you on a journey."
Wayne Williams,1,5,"Suffice to say, if something does what it claims to do in this day and age count me in. It does it with stars."
Herb Budd,2,4,"I very much appreciate the high quallity of your software, but have found your support very poor, almost a joke."
Tony Kent-francis,10,5,"Having used Norton for years I changed to Bitdelender after getting fed up with their poor backup.When I had a problem I used to get a respoce (after a delay) answering a totally different question. ie ""IS IT RAINING""answer ""TODAY IS MONDAY"" Think their call centre was India, I think yours is Spain ?"
Sandra Faulkner,1,4,It is great....has caught a few viruses
Client,1,5,"It has great customer server.  Never had problem with virus, before I use to use norton but i use to have problem."
Martin Connolly,3,5,"it works, it works"
Mudya Faisal,2,1,"Many of us have been receiving pop up advertisements on our desktops from bit defender since 2011. The problem seems to go away for a while and then, another 'sign up to our new security blah blah' comes up. It is very unprofessional and rude. The product is paid for and supposed to be non intrusive, so spamming with advertisements to upgrade is unreasonable and rude conduct - especially when we have 200+ days left on our licence! This is why I gave bit defender one star and I certainly will not be upgrading. It's a shame because the security is brilliant, it does not slow my computer down in the slightest and looks good. My advice, stop spamming your loyal customers - don't pretend to sort out the issue (they emailed us saying we had been removed from the desktop advertisement), but actually sort it."
Kehinde Omoseebi,1,3,"This is a great product as long as it works the way it's supposed to, but there are some glitches that occasionally deactivates the product while any of the two computers I installed it on are turned on. A message comes up and says ""Bitdefender services are not responding"", and the antivirus pilot screen just freezes up. Some damage can be done to any computer when the antivirus on it will not work as it's supposed to."
Dale Hakel,1,4,Like your product but your customer service is one of the worse. I lost a few months because my computer went down and had to relaod. Instead giving me couple months credit they tried to pressure you in buying another year and then will give me the extra months.
Steve,1,1,"I switched to Total Security and paid for the product.   I was also charged a $49.99 renewal for the Antivirus program.  Despite several attempts, I get no response to refund requests.  I now need to file a disputed charge claim with the credit card.   NOT sure WHY   I get NO response from Bitdefender customer service.  JUST IGNORED."
Bob Lowe,2,5,"I have used Bit Defender for several years.  To date, I have not had any issues with viruses or malware.  I recommend Bit Defender to all my friends, even to the point where I tell them to remove their old virus protection and replace it with Bit Defender."
Stuart Howie,3,5,"I used to use Norton software to protect my PC - and completely lost three hard-drives in two years to viruses! Someone put me onto Top Ten Reviews which recommended BitDefender.  I crossed my fingers and bought  a copy which covered my desktop and laptop as well as my wife's laptop.In the last five or six years, since moving to BitDefender, not a single virus or Trojan has got through! At one time I had a bit of a software conflict - a free phone call, surrendered control of my PC to their expert and job sorted inside 10 minutes!A great piece of software and a great service! The best!"
Jeff Barstow,1,4,Bitdefender lurks in the background and only jumps out when there is something wrong.  The only critique on the bitdefender clan is not the program but the marketing: I assume that the marketing dept. has access to sales records so why does the marketing dept. try to inform me that my license is about to expire when I have already renewed?
Kabuki0009,1,5,"Bitdefender are the best Windows based security products you can buy in my opinion.But not so good with Android, their licence for the mobile app is subscription based, while their competition give a life time license. As fortheir apple products I can not speak for them as I have never used them."
Sandu Gherman,1,5,If you want a better protection fir your computer and be safe online Bitdefender is the way to go.
Sue Gascoyne,1,5,"Bit defender seems to offer complete protection, and I cannot praise highly enough the guys who do the ""tuneup"" service. Been with this company now for about 5 years and it's easy to set up and use, and gets more user friendly with each new issue. Thing is though, only valid for 3 licences so two of us in this house both using on out machines, both of us need new machines but who gets to carry on using Bit Defender and which one has to pay again !"
Annn,1,1,I never seen such poor work nor such rude people before in my life..Its unreal how  you put out a product before you even worked the bugs out and expected us your valued members as you so like to say all the time..to put up with it..  If that's not bad enough you couldn't be bothered to even admit it was your program or get it fixed in a quick manner..instead you lied and accused every1 that it had to do with their computers..nor did you even offer us a refund or extended time on the upgrade due to the fact we couldn't use it..for as long as it was down.
Ian,15,5,Makes small imprint on operating system. Support much improved. All round a good choice.
Larry Akin,1,5,Over the past 15 years I have tried about every PC protecting software program on the market and I have come to believe that Bit Defender is the best software available.  About a year ago I removed Bit Defender from my computer to try the latest and greatest but within two weeks I was back with Bit Defender and this time I'm staying.
Don423,1,2,"I guess the system works well (how are we to know?) .  But the user controls and interface are not intuitive, and so far I haven't found a good user manual.  Periodically, the system says something like ""you have switched off auto pilot mode"" when I haven't done anything.  When I call up the dashboard, everything seems to be ""on"" and working.  So I'm not sure what's going on with that.   Also, my brand-new computer seems to go into deep-think mode for a half minute periodically when, say, opening a document.  This, with flash memory.  Doesn't make a lot of sense, and I don't know how to diagnose it or figure out whether Bitdefender  is part of the problem."
William Zuber,1,5,"I like bitdefender because I feel as though it is easy to use. The interface is almost intuitive. I feel as though it doesn't slow my machine down and it's through at protecting my system. I never liked norton because I always though it was slow and flashy. I don't like complicated super glossy interfaces because that's not the point of the software. Any internet security software should be subtle and unabtrusive as possible. If I have to interact with it a lot, other then deciding what to do with corrupted data, I feel like it's not doing what it should be. Bitdefender works exactly as I would like it to work. In the background, it doesn't slow me down, and I don't have to think about it. It even warns me about windows updates that are critical, I love that. I think if anyone is in the market for security software, Bitdefender is tops. I wish there was a Mac version."
Mark,1,3,Good Product except....  It is totally unacceptable that I am getting pop up boxes to upgrade to a new version or renew my subscription in the middle of the year.I contacted them about this and they basically said it would go away if I upgraded.Customer service is below average.
CS Roth,2,5,"The first time I downloaded and use Bitdefender, I became a loyal customer!  I had used Norton for many years and thought they were really getting beyond expensive!  I downloaded Bitdefender after some research where I learned they were the #1 product for antivirus and had received all kinds of awards.  It immediately found over 30 viruses and trojans that my ""up-to-date"" Norton software had not caught.  I needed no further explainations.  I'm sole on Bitdefender forever!!!!"
Client,2,4,It has caught quite a few problem with ease and repaired them.
Client,1,5,"This is my favorite anti virus so far.  It catches things that others don't.  The game mode is very nice.  It has not ""taken over"" my computer either.Probably a setting I can change, but it will scan a CD or USB when you plug it in.  It takes a long time to scan, especially if you try and access the CD/USB at the same time."
William,1,5,"Well for one thing, I've yet to get a virus on my computer in the 2 years that I've had BitDefender. As well, the interface is incredibly user friendly. I'm definitely hooked, I'd recommend BitDefender to anyone."
Dr Brian Matthews,9,5,The product is easy to load.  Easy to configure.  It then works in the background and does not interfere with the use of the PC until intervention is necessary.  Seems to pick up more problem files etc than Norton.
Lee Ford,2,4,"I have been using Bitdefender for a number of years and could not be happier.  I have never had an un-detected bug, virus, malware, etc. that was not captured.  I did have an odd system issue and contacted their support team.  It took a day but they were able to tell me how to fix the issue which I had not been able to figure out in months.  Highly recommend this product."
KEN G.,1,5,I have used this program for 8 years and will for many years to come.
Andy,1,5,Would and have recommended Bitdefender.
Pete,1,5,"I've used Bitdefrnder over six years on several computers without a hint of a probl. Last upgrade I had difficulty installing, however their IT people worked with me and it works as before. I don't think I'll ever use another security program."
Robert Jackson,5,3,"This is NOT the best time to be asking me this.I have had on open ticket for a week now, I am not being kept up to date, & I Still Can't download a product I've paid for."
Client,1,5,Awesome! Awesome!
Edward Keith Davie,1,5,Have used a number of different products over the years but Bitdefender is the product that I have decided to stay with.  Very comprehensive and thoroughly dependable.
Oliver,1,4,"As far as I am aware I have never got a virus, so it's got that going for it!Bitdefender is also very low profile so it does not hog resources when you are trying to do something else such as play a game. Bitdefender is also very customisable so you can control your security settings well.I'm unsure if it's the best internet security but it's certainly the best one I've used on my personal computers."
ST,10,5,I've used nearly all the different antivirus and firewall software on the market and have used Bitdefender for the last 5 years and never looked back. Nothing else comes close. Low on system resources and I have never had a virus or security breach on any of my pcs during the time I have used Bitdefender.
Kathryn Mathias,1,5,"I am still learning how to use windows 8 on my new laptop. When I installed Bitdefender and thought I had toggled on the last option, the screen suddenly went blank - bright blue. I was pretty scared that it was toast. I looked on the box for any instructions I might have missed during the install process and saw they had a 24 hour free on line help line. I used my old laptop to log in and Derek stepped me through bringing my laptop back up and running. So often when dealing with tech help, they are  either speaking in another language (tech) or seem to think you are really stupid and it comes across in the conversation. But Derek was not like that - he was polite and efficient and he made me feel like I was an equal partner in fixing the problem. I was very impressed with how quickly I got help and how well the live chat  worked. Also, once back on my computer I saw that Bitdefender had already gotten rid of an annoying adware popup :)  Kathy Mathias"
Mete Ergül,1,5,IM TESTED ALL ANTİVİRÜS BEST BİTDEFENDER AWESOME PERFECT ANTİVİRÜS
akhil,1,5,"i have been using free ware antivirus for years , and i love to see lots of security alerts , however Bitdefender antivirus pro takes all the decisions automatically with no user interaction at all . if it detects anomaly just a red dot pops up on main screen be careful of those and you are done .the detection is good with a third layer called ""active virus control "" it enhances the defenses. It managed to block an adware like behavior of one ""free firewall which was installed . There are more to its arsenal like rescue scan for highly infected systems it seems to do a preboot scan for rootkits and malware as well.new addition of wallet  to safely store passwords an additional addon.plus they have great link scanner keeping the computer off from maliciuos sites with a good addon to protect facebook accountsOverall a great security product"
Ali Hamza,1,5,"Bitdefender is the best and the most easiest to use AntiVirus out there, I have been using it for 2 years now and have never had any kind of problems with, if u want a AntiVirus that does everything to keep your PC safe, this one is for you"

Anjistha Bandyopadhyay,9,5,This is the fastest antivirus I have ever used.It also doesn't interfere and works silently in the background.
Pandu Andika,1,5,"BitDefender is best Protect my computer and internet security,no viruses can dally on my computer, haha !!! my comment only ""HEBAT BRO !!!""matur suwun buat jasamu !"
Alethia Fires Lasers,1,5,"I love your product. Am so glad that I moved on from the previous Internet Security Anti-virus that took up half of my drive C space. I have also tried numerous anti-viruses in my life, paid and free.Bitdefender Total Security definitely works seamlessly in the background and I don't feel much when it's running - even when gaming (with the gaming mode off too!).Great interface, features, sleek and easy to use. I also like the ""My BitDefender"" dashboard.Thank you. Very proud to be your customer and will recommend to the people I know!"
Antony Hibberd,2,5,"I dont think they initially did anything wrong, but something got me to try Bitdefender. Now i see AVG and every other AV software did, and has been doing everything wrong. BD is user friendly, has all grounds covered, included with an awesome interface and all the protection you wouldnt even think of, constantly working. Its annoying when you see them block a page and suggest you to stay away from it. Why is this annoying? because AVG and no other AV products ever did that. Thanks for awsome product/protection."
Lawrence Shimer,1,5,"I have used many A.V. programs over the years and even after wandering off to other products in the past I am always glad to be able to come home to Bitdefender.I love the piece of mind, and I am sure if my PC could talk it would agree.I hope Bitdefender is aware of the winner they have on their hands and I trust it simply because it works, and works well."
David Van Trigt,1,5,"I have used Bitdefender for years, I have never found anything better and have found it will find dozens of virus and malware that others such as Norton have missed."
Rolly MQ,2,5,"When you have the Bitdefender , you have the best product in the world :) ... I'm in love with this amazing product :)"
Tom Bridge,1,5,"I have been using Bitdefender for some years. Though I have tried many others, the protection afforded by this software surpasses that provided by similar products. Over the years it has been improved significantly, with easier set up and a simpler user interface. Additionally, it is no longer the resource 'hog' that it has been, and which many other well known brands continue to be. I have no hesitation in recommending this software to friends and family, and indeed openly publish my Bitdefender Safego results on my social network profile. Keep up the good work!!"
QPR Dave,2,5,"I’ve been a Bitdefender customer for a couple of years now as I’ve found it’s the best protection for my Mac.

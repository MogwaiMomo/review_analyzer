2		The five stars is specifically for Dr.Salzberg. She was helpful, bright, and so kind.  I highly recommend Dr.Salzberg.
10		The entire interactions I have had have been great
11		I needed a prescription refill and don't have a regular doctor since i lost my job at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I was very hesitant to actually go into an urgent care when I found PlushCare online.  Dr Wu was very helpful and asked the pertinent questions regarding my medication.  She also assisted me in getting follow-up bloodwork that I would be needing in the coming new year.  I was so pleased with how my virtual appointment went that I requested Dr Wu to be my primary care physician.
12		The doctor was caring, knowledgeable, and professional. The process of making an appointment was very simple, and I was able to be seen quickly.
13		Attentive, User Friendly, and exactly what I needed!
15		No less caring or competent than a GP office appointment and much more convenient.  Fair price.
17		This was exactly how routine health care should be. I had an appointment in 10 minutes and a vurtual doctor appointment in 30. It was amazing. I will never go back to traditional health care.
18		It's awesome to have such help whenever I need it and the way I can ask a question and have a response in reasonable time without having to go to the Doc office       I really love the help with my blood pressure problems and updates on my medication!
19		This was the best way to see a doctor especially during the covid 19 virus. It was so easy to use.Thank you
21		I was offered multiple different appointment times, even for the current day, by multiple doctors. I could see their picture and all the reviews for them. The doc I chose was not only extremely helpful, her bedside manner is very compassionate and genuine. She gave me as many options she could think of to solve my issue. I would recommend this to all my friends and family to use, whether you have insurance or not. Thank you for this tremendous service during a difficult time!
22		so helpful and easythanks for the great attention to detail, website, dr, and follow up
23		Dr was promp an right To my problem. All was great. Very  happy with everything
25		Doc was fantastic, understood my concerns & really helped me resolve my issue. It was easy, and extremely reasonably priced. I would recommend Plush care to anyone who can't get to their regular doctor during this strange time in history or anyone interested in a primary care physician online as an option or in addition to in-person care.
26		I will use this service again!! Loved my Dr also!!
27		The doctors I have spoken with have been very professional, attentive to my words & taken good care of me. I will continue to use PlushCare during this pandemic for sure!
28		Received better information on my condition than I did when I had insurance.
29		Very helpful and easy to use. The doctor was right on time and gave me the attention I needed without all the waiting in an office.
30		I am SHOOK at how great Plushcare is. I feel like there is so much more transparency than I'm used to, and every doctor I'm met has been wonderful.
31		I had Covid-19 from February '20 to August '20.  Plushcare help in:1) Diagnosing the virus and directing me to medical assistance2) The medical assistance provided me with a new scientific formula and steroid that finally turned the virus around in 24 hours3) Has provided me with RX's that have fended off the residual effects of Covid-19, i.e., acute Bacterial Bronchitis and acute Viral Bronchitis 4) And has followed up on my care and results consistently.Thank you Plushcare for being there for me when the doctors office told me that should I come into their office with Covid-19 they would have me arrested for trespassing.  I can always count on you!
32		I had problems with your software for my smart phone. Aside from that the doctor was great and I was able to get my 3 month refill which will afford me time to search for another doctor. Mine passed on unexpectedly
33		Good doctors that listen to you, better than going to see one at least in the area that I live in.
35		I’m participating in a study through the organization Fitbit. Their watch uncovered an abnormal heart beat. It is currently being investigated through the sensor I just returned. I appreciate the free service from Fitbit. Hope to hear from someone soon.
36		Extremely convenient and efficient. As someone who travels constantly and has a frequently changing schedule, it’s comforting to know I can book an appointment at my convenience when needed and interface with a doctor who will order labs, renew my prescriptions and contact me with my results. I found the physicians to be caring and thorough. As a former RN, I was very pleased with the care I received.
37		I have nothing but praise for the way my issue was dealt with and the efficiency with which  my prescription was forwarded to a nearby pharmacy.
38		I wanted a convenient and reasonably priced option for visiting a doctor without having to go to an in person visit. As someone who usually uses urgent care, this site offered everything I was looking for. I easily set up an appointment and met with a doctor. The doctor was wonderful and was able to quickly find solutions that worked for my ailment. I am so glad that this option exists for us. I will be using this site again for any future ailments.
40		Doctor  was friendly and understood my concerns. He went over the types of antibiotics that I would need for my infection and recommended the correct one with minimal side effects of which I had none. I am 100% better thanks to him!
41		PlushCare has been amazing so far to me. My doctor is super nice and very thorough.
42		The sign up is easy, and my doctor was prompt and Very Helpful!

44		As a high risk probability for COVID due to congenital issues I really appreciate the fast responses, thorough service, and excellent care that these doctors and this service provide.
45		I am very happy to have found PlushCare. Someone who has not seen a Dr. in many years it is hard to find a Dr. in my area that will except a person with out insurance. I am going to be 65 in March and have been waiting for my medicare to become effective. Not only is PlushCare affordable for me but I found a Doctor who listens to me. I will be using PlushCare for as long as possible. Thank you for being here.
46		Your service is wonderful. I was able to meet with a doctor within the same day and receive treatment. Dr. Barrow’s was extremely helpful and I’m happy to use PlushCare again in the future.
49		Dr. Marks was amazing
50		Wonderful and caring physician. Dr.Klenk spent more time with me then my in person PCP! DEFINITELY would recommend Plushcare.
52		As always, Plush Cares Doctors were responsive to my every need, took the time to listen and provide top-notch medical advise. In this Covid era, it's great to have Plush Care here on my side!
53		I really  liked every aspect of the process...my physician was outstanding:1.  This was an easy way to communicate with your physician felt as though I was I. The same room with him... he was thorough as you can be when in a virtual environment 2.  Your app was easy to use 3.  Got my  script within 30 minutes of the appointment
54		I am so happy to have this service available to me.  The doctor was friendly and efficient. I needed a refill on my prescription as I had moved to a new state and hadn’t yet found a new doctor. She asked me the relevant questions and spent about as much time with me as my previous doctor had! I will stick with her as long as I can.   Quick and professional. Recommended highly.
55		I had an amazing experience. My MD was spot on. I would def recommend this to anyone who does not want to possibly expose themself to the Corona Virus, someone who doesn’t have a ride to their appointment or someone who’s just too sick and doesn’t feel like leaving home.
56		Honestly if I can get all of my medical appts here I will

101		Dr was very good and the video worked beautifully.  It's a really nice alternative when your loved one can't get out of the house and you badly need advice.
102		This was the first time I'd ever try an online, virtual Dr. appt. You have a choice of doctors w/their bios, easy to choose appt slots and they take take insurance. I realize that not everything can be handled virtually, but this is a great alternative to going out during the pandemic. I had a UTI and the Dr quickly diagnosed it and sent the prescription to CVS. Totally an A++ experience.

120		I received timely and immediate professional care via a video conference with one of Plush Cares physicians. As a retired Hospital  Chaplin I know a little about what good medical care is and I would recommend Plush Care to everyone searching for good, compassionate medical care.
121		"Due to Covid, I only had a """"virtual visit"""" with my primary care physician last Spring. After listening to my heart she would've done an EKG an found the afib, but she couldn't because it was well . .  a virtual visit. If not for the FitBit Heart Study, I wouldn't have known about my afib~!! I've had heart failure in the past, and recovered fully, but no history whatsoever of afib. FitBit sent me the heart monitor, which I wore for 10 days. I had a virtual visit with PlushCare's Dr. Jennifer Huldin where she informed me that I was in afib 100% of the time and advised me to call my cardiologist asap, which I did. He immediately put me on blood thinners. I am so very Thankful to the FitBit Heart Study and Plushcare's Dr. Huldin. If I'd waiting until covid was over to have an echocardiogram who knows, I might not have survived~! Thank You All So Much~!!"
122		Plush care has opened my life. I live on a boat and enjoy this freedom.
123		This was a very easy to use platform - once I got my different devices working.I would prefer a face to face with someone who knows me but that is getting harder to come by these days and this is a very decent substitute for that with easier access.
124		Plush Care was a Godsend for me. The service is great and my doctor was excellent. I would recommend it to anyone who is having trouble finding a good doctor.
125		"Quick, easy, efficient. Great service and friendly, prompt staff. They far and away exceeded our expectations. Also, I highly recommend Dr. Allan Marks, great """"bedside"""" manner..."
127		A shout out to Dr. Joseph Nichols who made my first telemedicine visit productive and enjoyable.Thank you for your thoughtful and caring approach in discussion; I will return soon to get the tests that you recommended.PlushCare is an oasis of medical services in a somewhat unhinged world.Much appreciated.
128		Timely response and submission of prescription,   through eval of medical history and present issues prior to treatment decisions.
129		I am 100 percent satisfied with PlushCare Vitural Healthcare. My first time using PluahCare was a world away from previous experiences elsewhere.

I was very ill and doctor gave me the right medications, had I waited till Tuesday for my doctor I probably would not be alive now.  Thank you for everything you do.  Please keep up the good work helping people with COVID-19.  I have been referring my friends to you.
156		My primary care doctor is wonderful - knowledgeable and caring.
158		I received good health service as expected.
159		I love PlushCare.  The fact that I don't have to leave my home to go to a Doctors Office is very comforting and makes me feel safe during these trying times.

162		A great service when people are scared to go to their primary doctor because of Covid-19.

177		Quick, prompt customer service
178		When I could not get in to see my primary doctor, and knew I did not want to go sit and wait at the ER or Urgent Care, I decided to give Plush Care a try.  I was overwhelmingly impressed.  Within 20 minutes of making an appt., I was online speaking with a physician.  He wanted me to go to lab and have test done.  I left immediately after our online visit.  When I arrived at the lab, my orders were already there.  When I went to pick up my meds, they had already been ordered and were being filled.
179		The physicians are very professional, friendly, helpful and caring.
181		Everything was easy to do...from downloading the app, to scheduling the appointment, to meeting with the doctor, to getting my prescriptions ordered.

190		I was very happy with my Doctor Cesar Duque. He takes his time with you. Is very knowledgeable in his field of medicine.
192		Because of Covid and doctors not taking new patients, plushcare made it easy and affordable to get my thyroid medication.  Every person I've spoken with is polite and helpful.  I was spacing out my medication because I was almost out and plushcare came to me rescue!
193		It helps to see a doctor on weekends and evenings online wo/emergency room visit. This is the best part.  Please continue to offer this!  Also, please consider payment plans or a lower price on the 1st visit for the uninsured.
195		I was on vacation when I had an odd pain develop. Being out of my home state, I didn't know where to look. So I Googled nearby Urgent Cares & Plush Care popped up first. I was a bit apprehensive but I signed up. I am so glad I did. I got the first appointment of the morning. Dr.Vugt came on promptly on time and helped me. I am so grateful for this site.

199		Great appointment. The appointment was on time and easy to do on my phone. Dr. Merino was friendly professional, knowledgeable and helpful. She took the time to listen and then easily diagnosed and prescribed for thrush. I just love that I did not have to leave my house for a simple medical problem that was easily remedied! Thank you so much!
201		My call was right to the point the doctor actually listened to what I had going.. I don’t have any complains.
202		I am in between doctors at this time and do not feel comfortable in any medical facility or public places during the covid outbreak. I was able to consult with Dr Reich on line and get the medicine I was needing.  My only drawback to this situation was that they could not accept my insurance? I would recommend Plushcare to anyone needing a Dr visit. 😁👍🏻
203		Thankful for doing the heart study. It possibly could have saved my life. Flounder I have AFIB. TY
204		Easy and professional.
205		PlushCare is awesome!! I got a UTI in June and due to COVID I didn’t want to go to an urgent care so found PlushCare through googling. I signed up for the service at 4am (up due to said UTI) and made an appointment for 8:15am. The doctor dialed in right on time (Through video call) and asked a few questions to understand my situation, and by 8:20am he had sent a prescription to my nearest pharmacy, so I had antibiotics in hand at 9am. All without having to wait an urgent care and paying about 25% of what an urgent care visit would have cost. I got another UTI a few months later and scheduled an appointment with the same doctor, who reviewed my symptoms,  how my previous medication worked, etc. He again dialed in right on time and I had medication within 30 mins of the call.I highly recommend this service - it’s seamless, efficient, much cheaper than urgent care visits, and the doctors are caring and knowledgeable!
206		I needed to follow up with my doctor and the app made everything very easy.
207		The Dr. I saw I believe his first name was Rajid really not sure but he was very compassionate very knowledgeable and made me feel very at ease.   I am not a computer tech kind of person but it was very easy to access the service.
209		Never even knew the service existed. Very quick, efficient and professional. Thank you.
210		Excellent 5 star services
211		The doctors are knowledgeable and very capable in treating a persons ailments. They offer expert advice and treatment customized to your needs. The website is very easy to use and professional. PlushCare has concierge services. For example, helping you obtain a local doctor. A doctor who specializes in medicine relevant for your condition. PlushCare will always be there every step of the way. PlushCare  believes that everyone deserves a special attention.
212		Would use again and much better than going to urgent care where there is a lobby of other sick people.
213		Very comfortable  and efficient  experience
214		I absolutely recommend Plushcare Doctors they are excellent!!! I have three busy boys and I utilize their services all the time. You can schedule appointments to your convenience all without stepping foot into a doctors office and without the worry of being exposed to Covid!!! They take care of all my family’s needs and have Excellent Customer Service!!!
215		Can't be grateful enough for the plushcare app. I don't know what I would have done without it.
216		The APP was easy to use. I got to speak to a doctor within 30 minutes after signing in. Dr. Kristy Acosta was very thorough and pleasant. She ordered blood tests right away and gave me the prescription I needed for thyroid replacement medication. She followed up several times. I highly recommend Plush Care. Very Professional.
217		In the past the most of doctors I have seen all seem to follow a routine of  confusio in my opinion.  he doctors that I have spoken with at PlushCare have been up to speed before I talked with them and asked a lot more in depth questions.  Very fast, top quality physcian, and good advise.  I will continue to use them.  Thank you.
218		I love that I was able to make an appointment within a few hours.My doctor had a great bedside manner and made me feel very comfortable. When I had a follow-up question customer service was excellent. Overall wonderful experience.
219		Dr Haran is excellent at gay men’s health issues. Life saver
220		This was a great service.  Saved so much time and money.  I independently checked the doctor’s credentials after the visit: top qualifications.  I didn’t have insurance and payed cash. Saved so much.
221		So very helpful! Love having PlushCare as an option for my health care
222		PlushCare has been great for me! I’ve been able to get a lupus test done and my thyroid medicine refilled. I also have my primary care Dr. through PlushCare. My Dr.’s have been very compassionate and caring and took the time to listen to my concerns. Thank you PlushCare!
223		Very professional and solved my sinus infection
224		It was an awesome experience wherein I could get good care without leaving the comfort of my house! It was absolutely amazing!
225		Without plush care I wouldn't have my medicine right now!  I travel all the time and don't have an address. Thank you!!
227		Dear Plushcare,The services you rendered to me (consultation and rx) were excellent. In less than an hour from signing up, I received a thorough consultation and a prescription for antibiotics that was sent to my pharmacy and almost immediately available for pickup.I have endorsed you several times now. I will continue to use your service as necessary.May I ask that you stop asking me for my opinion? I have given you excellent reviews many many times now. Please stop. This is becoming annoying.Many thanks,Micaela
231		I had a great first time experience. Doctor answered my questions.
232		Very happy the district has this plan it beats going to the doctor and always waiting to be seen love it keep up the great work
233		My experience with Plush Care was just outstanding. Within 5 minutes your amazing Doctor diagnosed my situation and had a script already called in to our local pharmacy within those 5 minutes. Between 24-48 hours later I was completely cured of my out of control UTI.I have told my family about this amazing service, and to be sure, if something such as this should happen to me again. Plush Care is where I will be heading. It saved me a 25 minute trip to the Doctor's Office and onto to our Hospital Lab during a time when I was already feeling so badly. I'm better YIPEE... Thank you so very much. What a great team of service you have and provided us all with. Blessings and Peace, Lucinda M Lickver
234		Absolutely fantastic. I'll definitely be returning. My doctor was truly one of the best I've ever had. Attentive, detailed, concerned (I appreciate the follow-up call), wise and experienced. SO glad I reached out to PlushCare.
235		Great health care provider. very convenient quality service.
236		Wonderful service. No waiting in a Doctors office for hours. You make an appointment by choosing the date and time. The video visit is over the app. Extremely convenient ,time saving, and economical.

250		Great service - great doctor.  Very fast - will definitely be using them again.
251		I'm very happy that I saved so much time and money.  This was very easy for an issue that was immediate.  My great insurance covered my medications as usual and they arrived the same day as my appointment.  I'm very appreciative.
253		If you can’t get in contact with your previous doctor then this is an excellent alternative!  I was able to pick up my prescription within an hour!
259		Great dr, asked appropriate questions, easy to talk to, great follow through..amazingly easy
263		Today was my first time using Plush Care, and I would definitely recommend the service.  My physician, Dr. Christina Garcia, was professional and friendly.  From the registration to the video chat, I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience.  I absolutely love it!
265		PlushCare is an excellent service provider of the healthcare industry. Dr. Judith  Tessama was  my care physician. She is knowledgeable, understanding, empathetic and everything else you need a doctor to be. I recommend giving PlushCare and their excellent doctors an opportunity to help you during the COVID -19 epidemic. This is the safest way to go!
266		My doctor was AMAZING. Thank you for being there for me Dr. Scott!
271		Used Dr Thomas Wade with PlushCare appt today. Excellent on time, professional service. I was in a bind w/ bp medication refills. Was extremely satisfied..... my refill was at the pharmacy of my choice in one hour!  Really liked Dr. Wade.... thank you!
273		If I could give 6 stars I would DR. Riad Abdelkarim was superb highly recommend.  Thank you so much for helping me out
275		My son was caught in a perfect storm right before Memorial Day....primary care Dr retired, extremely bad throat and sinus infection, Sunday before a holiday and a very poor “minuteclinic” experience....Thank god for plushcare.com prescribing an antibiotic to cure him!  We owe you as a family....I’d give you a 100 stars if I Could!  Sincerely,   Roger W Wendel   (Sugar Creek, MO)
276		"Great service and very affordable and easy to use.  It helped me a lot during the """"Covid-29 Isolation period."""""
277		There are so many times when it is not convenient, nor necessary, to go to a doctor's office. PlushCare to the rescue! The doctor's have taken care of my concerns in every instance at a time that is best for me in the comfort of my own home. They have been knowledgeable, caring, and efficient.
278		The kindest and most compassionate Dr. I have met, Dr Natalie Marino has an amazing way to communicate and care about the patient. I'm grateful for Plushcare and her. I recommend 100%.
279		I used Dr. Marks as my Teledoc when I thought that I had the Covid virus. He was reassuring, very knowledgeable, and gave me exact instructions on how to handle everything. I feel very reassured and calm after talking to him. I can’t recommend him and the service enough. I also called back a few months later and he helped me with continuing issues. I highly recommend Him and this service.
282		It was easy to make an appointment and the Dr was wonderful.
283		Awesome, fast easy and friendly...exactly what I needed.
286		I ran out of my normal anxiety medicine and my therapist had not answered my phone calls or emails for the past few weeks. Panicking, I googled how to get a refill and CarePlush came up. Within an hour, I had an appointment, got my prescription filled, and my anxiety level dropped amazingly. This is a great service and I would highly recommend to anyone who needed their medicine filled.
289		They were absolutely a pleasure to work with. There were tech issues the first evening and so I had to re book for the next day. They didn’t charge my card for that first day, since there was a tech prob and they got the issue taken care of between 6:30 on a Saturday evening, and that morning at around 3 am when I booked another appt. I messaged the care team that Saturday night and by Sunday morning I heard back and everything was taken care of. The care team there was on top of their game and they were great!!  The doctor was absolutely nice! He listened to what was going on and what I needed. It was a great experience after the tech hiccup!  Will definitely be going back. And for the price, you can’t beat it. I didn’t have ins, so I also looked up prices on good rx and I called a local pharmacy that I knew had good prices, and I did this ahead of time so that I had the info for my pharmacy before speaking with the doc. Anyways, 2 thumbs up and 10 stars for greatness!!  Thanks again and I would recommend anyone to them!
293		I'm sure not every issue can be handled using tele-medicine, but Plush Care sure has made it easy and effortless when its appropriate for the circumstances.  I'm very pleased with the care and attention I received from the doctor I saw - he was a real person, with genuine concern for my concern.
294		PlushCare is genuine and in my honest opinion quite unique experience.  Some individuals like myself cannot afford to go to healthcare facilities.  If you are a person who knows their medical history and are in need of a physician to  refill your medications that is needed on a daily basis, then PlushCare is the right place for you!!!--K. Barnes
295		Great Enter action with Team and Doctors.Really Care about Patient .The next day follow up really shows you care.Thank you for Caring!!Angel
296		It was a simple and  convenient experience.
298		I highly like the services that we're offered to me. All questions were answered in a timely manner
302		Best experience! Fast and efficient
304		Excellent service, would recommend to anyone!
305		So easy, very professional, impressed by the doctors!
308		Always professional, caring and accurate. Thanks again
309		Honest helpful and straightforward person
310		They were available and accurate in the diagnosis and treatment. Greatly appreciated.
311		Thank you so much for being there for me. I will be call back again. The doctor was excellent. Thanks again.
312		Plush is easy to use. The doctors are friendly, caring, and knowledgeable. They are always prepared to make a correct diagnosis and help you to the best of their ability.
313		great care!  right on time and accurate diagnoisis
315		My experience with Plush Care was amazing. I was down to my last 5 days of medication and was dreading trying to see my pcp because she has been reluctant to refill my anxiety medication. I was able to get a same-day appointment with Dr. Cleary at 8:15pm, which was super convenient with my work schedule. The appointment was efficient and I felt like Dr. Cleary set me at ease about the process with Plush Care. As a skeptical person, I admit I wasn’t sure how quality the services would be as this was my first time using a telehealth provider. However, I must say Dr. Cleary was extremely knowledgeable and even expressed an interest in discussing my other medical conditions, which made me feel that my visit was not just about throwing medications at a problem, but rather reaching a consensus about a long term treatment plan. His approach was very comprehensive, addressing my medical history as a whole. In the end, I was able to get my medication refilled and I left the appointment feeling assured in the care I received and I can honestly say I look forward to following up in a few months.
316		My lung specialist wanted me to come to his office in the medical center of the hospital. Probably wanted his $500.00 fee at my Health Risk. I called Plushcare rep. very nice lady. 5 maybe 10 minutes later we were done and I had an appointment for 1:30 following day and the doc called on time very nice guy got my prescription for Symbicort  and I asked him if he could prescribe Mucinex so maybe insurance might cover it if a doc says I need it. The reviewers who gave a bad reviews are probably looking for looking for dope. I read their reviews and you can't get dope without seeing a doctor. One said this is a scam. That person doesn't have a clue. I had my prescriptions in 4 hours. 3 1/2 hours was the wait was the pharmacy.
317		Outstanding service for my first telehealth appointment. I'm a registered nurse in NYC, and my internist is occupied with his critically ill patients. Dr Panach was amazing, caring and thorough. Great to speak and see your doctor. She was on time, and took her time to ask and answer questions. Called in my prescription to my own pharmacy.  So convenient. Its important to understand to log into the app using your email and password. Then you can facetime the doctor you chose. Highly recommended!!!!
318		I posted a review this morning in regards to my appointment video being shut down multiple times while speaking with my doctor. (The physicians at Plushcare are really great!!) I received a reply to my review from a Plushcare team member who was very concerned and assured me that the issue was being attended to. I am very appreciative to her response and care in this matter. It is with gratitude that I am gladly editing my review. Thank you, Veronica, for caring for my health as well as others for whom this has impacted
323		This was my first time using the app & service. The rxperience was so wonderful. So easy, the doctor was very nice & understanding.  We were both experiencing  technically connection difficulties due to weatherIm sure he called me to finish the live chat. Called me in medicine. I will chevk back in about 3 wks to see how things are going and the price will be half of todays visit. I didnt have to take off work, called in for the appt on a sunday. I mademy appt sat for a sunday appt at my convenience. Overall I give Plushcare a 5. Id give a 10 but thats not an optiin. Thank you!!
324		Easiest appointment I've ever had and Dr. Marks was wonderful. He was kind, personable, and showed genuine concern for my well-being. I will use this service whenever possible. This was by far the easiest doctors visit from scheduling to picking up my prescription that I've ever had. Would recommend to anyone needing a doctor on short notice. It took 13 minutes out of my work day, rather than several hours - which helped to alleviate my stress. I had none of the issues waiting around that you usually do with a doctor's visit. Overall I'm thrilled with this website!
325		I am extremely pleased with the services PlushCare provides, and especially pleased with Dr. Tina Wu (Northern California) who I recently had an appointment with through PlushCare. I have never used any online health care service provider before and was unsure about how PlushCare worked or how complicated the process might be. I was extremely pleased with my entire experience and amazed at how quickly and easily I was able set an appointment to meet with Dr. Wu (within an hour of signing up) and get my prescriptions renewed immediately. I was very happy with how easy it was to complete the online information and to meet with a physician via video chat using my iPhone without driving anywhere or waiting to see a physician in person. I also appreciate Dr. Wu's undivided attention during our call, the excellent advice and feedback she gave me, and the fact that she answered all questions I had regarding a number of health related issues. I also greatly appreciate the fact that Dr. Wu was available to take a call from my pharmacy to approve a slight adjustment to my prescription because the pharmacy was out of one of the medications prescribed. I found the price to be very, very reasonable, especially for the level of medical service provided, and the cost to use PlushCare was actually far less than it would have cost me in time and fuel expenses to drive to an appointment and wait to see a doctor to achieve the same result. Based on my excellent experience with PlushCare, I would definitely recommend their services to anyone who is in need of medical care -- with or without healthcare insurance -- and would definitely recommend Dr. Wu for anyone seeking excellent medical care/advice in California.
326		I can't describe how awesome and convenient this service is for me. I had the pleasure of having Dr. Klenk as my physician, and her assistant. She helped me tremendously with getting enrolled on a medication program and was so thorough and showed honest concern for my health and well being, she's actually the best physician I have ever had.  Amazing app and amazing Dr, thank you so much!
327		I had  an amazing experience with Dr. Allan Marks. He was kind and thorough. He answered my questions and refilled my meds. This was by far the least stressful doctor’s “visit” I have ever experienced.
328		called spoke to doctor prescription was filled.very easy very quick.
329		This is such a great service! I spoke with the doctor and my perscription was filled in about 30 minutes and that was all. Thank you!!!
330		Purchase has been solid and sound care for me when absolutely no one else cared. Very efficient, and got my life meds to my rd quickly.Saved me time and time againThanks teamGratefullyDeLe Holbein
331		Dr. David Dante was extremely helpful when it was a really stressful time with pneumonia. I had been in and out of the hospital, but needed some advice on whether I should go back to the ER or go to urgent care. This service is great! Perfect when I'm traveling and need a prescription refill or need to see a doctor.
332		Very easy to use and every Doctor has been great to work with. Have refilled my meds and taken care of labs for 2 years without a problem!
334		Spoke with Dr Garcia and she was very kind and understanding, simple setup and the ease of this is superb. Will do it again if anything comes up!
336		This is a fantastic service! I am Canadian and was travelling to San Diego for a conference. I developed respiratory issues on the flight out due to the air conditioning system being stuck on full heat the entire journey. By the time I reached San Diego, I could hardly breath. I discovered Plushcare on a google search for medical care and made an online appointment. I received a response for the doctor on schedule. He reviewed my symptoms and my history of chronic respiratory issues. A prescription was sent to a pharmacy 2 blocks from my hotel. Within a couple of days, I was starting to feel great relief and by the time I returned to Canada, the issue was mostly resolved. I highly recommend Plushcare.
337		I am without insurance which is unknown territory for me. I woke up with pain in my eye, knowing the symptoms of a corneal ulcer. I considered going to an urgent care but found PlushCare when googling. I read the reviews and paid $99For an appointment with Dr. Stephanie Anderson. I used the app to connect to Dr. Anderson. She’s was kind, thorough and I felt like I was there right with family doc. In 10 minutes we addressed my eye and my regular prescription that needed a refill. She sent the scripts to the pharmacy that I pre-chose before the end of our appointment and my scripts were ready in 30 minutes at my local CVS/Target. I could not have been more appreciative and delighted by this experience. For sure would recommend and would use again.  **i received NO incentives for this review**
338		Stephanie Anderson is the best. She was very understanding and willing to assist with all my needs. Plush care is also very convenient you dont have to wait in the Dr. Office you just sit in the comfort of your own home and talk to the doctor.  Give them a try
340		I have been recommending plush care to my coworkers. I really think  they are the best thing since slice bread, very convenient. It really turned around for me  when I  discovered that they really care and want to give the very best service possible. And if you are having any kind of issue with the service being provided and if they can do anything within their power they will help. This I know from first hand experience. It’s a win,win situation. I work in custusmer service my self so you can believe me when I say they rock.
341		Great Service, Easy to Schedule, Accurate Diagnosis, Reasonable Price, So Convenient and the Doctor was very nice

343		Quick, simple and convenient!
344		Always a great experience I love this service

354		After my signs and system were discussed, Dr prescribed remedy
355		Great customer service and follow-up reminders each month!
356		First time was easy. Doctor was very nice. Didn't brush me iff but actually talked. The cost for me was like going to the emergency room visit without the wait. Thanks you for this.
357		This is the greatest service. I got in touch wtih a Doc named Elizabeth Klenk... and it was an awesome experience because SHE is a frickin' good doctor. Good doctor + good technology = happy customer.
359		Easy, convenient and great physician!
360		So much better than having to sit in a crowded room of sick people! I was very pleased with the doctor and would highly recommend.
361		Quick and easy when your time is so valuable..nice doctor
364		I am so thankful to have the ability to access a service like Plushcare. I have used them twice now and have had an amazing experience each time. The 2nd time I scheduled an appointment I had to phone customer service.  They answered promptly,  and were able to answer all my questions.  Thank you so much!
365		The doctor actually listens to you. He is very well informed and excellent at making you feel at ease. The company is super accomodating, and get right on any requests that might arise ( i e prescriptions or test orders). My, many, experiences allow me to recommend the service to anyone without any reservations...I'm thrilled with the absolute professional care I have received from my doctor and the staff. A 10 out of 10 experience.
366		Scheduled an appointment while at work at 10:30am through the app. Had my appointment at 11am through video chat. Had my talk with the doctor, prescription called in and back to work at 11:05am. Picked up my prescription on the way home. Well done PlushCare
367		Fantastic use of technology for non-emergency issues. I already refer to everyone I know.
368		At first I thought it was a gimmick I look to go to Quick Care they wanted 150.00  to walk in the door and whatever the doctor charged in back...so the 99.00 was no problem... professional experience would recommend to anyone they even called  my prescription in thanks plushcare..give it a try!!!!
369		Appointments on time. Very professional and concerned about your health. Prescriptions called in promptly. No hassle way to take care of your health care.
370		Easy. Dr. Was thorough. Got better fast. I would highly recommend plushcare and their doctors.convenient too. Can see dr.s right away instead of waiting 2 weeks
371		very pleased!  What a great idea this is.  Saves a trip to the Dr for minor problems.  Highly recommend!
372		Great service. Very informative just by sign and symptoms. I don't always have time to see a doctor so I found PlushCare and the MD I chose was awesome.
373		The PlushCare Doctor was very sympathetic and kind hearted.  He listened carefully and asked pertinent questions directly related to my diagnosis.  He reviewed my written medical history with me, he was very thorough.
374		PlushCare did a great job. I could not be happier
375		I’ve used it a few times now and it’s fantastic. The perfect alternative when your primary is too booked to see you.
376		Great service. Easy to use reasonably priced, fast, effective

378		Doctor was excellent with diagnosis and treatment. I am problem free thanks to him.Great follow up too.
379		Always helpful and easy to access. The perfect alternative when the regular doctor is unavailable.
380		My experience with PlushCare was very positive leaving me feeling confident and well informed after my phone visit. All of my questions were answered and our conversation never felt rushed in order to keep within a certain appointment period. PlushCare is a service that I plan to use on a regular basis and will recommend it to others.
381		The doctor was helpful.  Very thorough.
383		I am very pleased with PlushCare.They've been phenominal
385		Easy, convenient,  trust worthy!
386		I love the convenience and the cost. I was able to have my doctor's visit in my office without taking time off work and my prescriptions we're ready at the closest pharmacy when I headed home for the day. For those with kids away at college it's great too!
387		Easy, fast, the doctor was nice and listened/made sure to address my concerns.
389		I was able to reach a person on the phone to help me navigate my way to getting labs done for my insurance company.  Thank you!

397		I had reservation about seeing a doctor via video conference. But the doctors were very professional. Very knowledgeable. Answered all my questions. I would definitely continue to use the service and recommend the service as it is often more convinient than traditional outlets.
398		From the appointment making (which can be chosen day OR night) to the kindness of the doctors, staff,  the respect the doctors give, the professionalism, the accuracy of diagnoses with pictures & discussion, its just like being right in the doctors office but you're at home!!Communication is huge & these guys communicate! Dr. Clearly has been my doctor on PlushCare & I adore him to pieces! He is wonderful with me & very quick to ensure my antibiotics or pain reliever is available quickly. Keep up the awesome work!!!
399		I had an excellent visit with my doctor. She listened to all my concerns, I was not rushed by any means. I felt very comfortable.  In the end medication was prescribed and at a very low cost $3.  I would definitely recommend PlushCare to all!
400		Easy to get an appointment and affordable- the doc was on time- personable - and professional!!!  Great service- thanks!
402		I got a prompt reply from the doctor. He listened carefully and explained the treatment and ordered two prescriptions to my local pharmacy. This is a great service.
403		Fast, efficient way to handle minor issues without having to go to an emergent care where you might be exposed to other illnesses from people waiting to be seen. I've used PlushCare twice and have been very happy with them.
405		Love this app and the physicians who are very friendly and genuinely interested
406		Excellent service and ability to schedule a convenient time for consultation with a doctor. I have had great experiences with PlushCare.
410		With a new baby i don't have time to wait in a doctors office and risk getting me or my baby sick. PlushCare is my new doctor!
411		FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY !!!!!
412		My doctor retired and I didn't know how I was going to get the prescriptions that had to be refilled. This was great. I talked to the doctor he sent the refills my drug store and them the same day. Thank You
413		Plushcare is so easy and convenient to book any appointment for any need you may have. I highly recommend anyone to use them.
414		I was iffy about using PlushCare at first since I never heard of them, but I gave them a chance and I've been using them ever since.  The doctors are great and they listen and they're always on time.  Excellent service! I've never had an issue and they take insurance. I'd give them more stars if possible.
415		Great doctor!
416		My doctor was clear and understanding and to provide me with the best care.
419		Excellent service, great DR's. Replaces waiting in line some where you dont want to be.I am thinking of switching this to my primary care. Very cost effective.

423		Great service. Always understanding and helpful. Will use again !!!
424		The doctors are knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.
425		For basic medical needs you can't beat them. My last appointment was at 8:45 Saturday morning and the doctor logged in right on time. No more waiting rooms.
427		Very thorough experience with the doctor who listened and was much more convenient than going to my primary care physician.
428		Very awesome company. Doctors are there to help you not just take your money. I have recommended this to friends , family , and even my employees at the company I own
429		It was very easy, the doctor was punctual, professional and helpful.
430		We moved and do not have a family doctor yet. I needed a refill for a prescription. It was the fastest and cost effective way to get a refill.
431		Excellent service
432		Amazing!!! Appointment within 30 mins. Spoke to doctor, he looked up coupons for medication and it was prescribed and in my hand in 30 minutes!!! Loved the whole process!!!
434		Easy way to take care of minor medical issues
435		They are 5 plus stars they treat u and they get u with medicines u need and dr to treat other things u might need i recommend them 1000%
437		Very good experience with Plush Care and the doc I spoke with.
438		Doctor was excellent and what he gave me fixed my problem :) I am very happy because I was dealing with a pinched nerve on my neck which was driving me crazy!
439		I was able to get in for an appointment right away. The doctor was polite, thorough and prompt with the appointment time, unlike waiting in doctors offices! It was so awesome to be able to not have to get out while I was sick and barely felt like sitting up. It’s like the old days where doctors came to your house and saw you from your bed! The prescription was called in promptly. The cost of the visit was very reasonable. I recommended the service to 2 other people who had the same flu, and they also loved the service. Will use it again and again.
440		Excellent help, fast and efficent.
441		Excellent service.
443		The greatest experience the doctors really care about your health they are there to help I’ve already told everyone about them love it!!! A+++++
444		The people at PlushCare has been helpful and supportive from the very start. Kind, non judgmental, quick to respond to my needs.
447		I've used PlushCare for over a year and am completely satisfied with their service.  The 2 doctors that I've seen have both been professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I'm confined to a wheelchair and using the doctors on PlushCare is MUCH more convenient for me than actually going into a doctor's office for prescription refills and minor ailments.  I highly recommend them.PlushCare team.
448		I really appreciate that Dr. Nair took the time to explain how my meds work, and why periodic blood work is needed. It was the most informative medical visit I've ever had.
451		Good service .Dr listened then prescribed treatment. Would use again.
452		I am running a successful small business and it doesn't leave a lot of time for things like sitting in a doctors office for an hour or more. Especially when all I want to do is renew my blood pressure medication.
453		"As professional, perfect, and """"Peace-Of-Mind-ish"""", as you can get!  Simply thee best!!"
454		Great visit emailed about other issue and doctor took care of with no issue great people
455		Easy and comprehensive right from the living couch...few apps can deliver at this level. Thanks for making me feel better.
457		In my experience, Plush care has the Best doctors ever...
458		I've used PlushCare multiple times for medication refills when in a bind. Last time, while on my way to Florida I realized I was running low. I booked an appointment and got a prescription refill while waiting for my flight! It was at the pharmacy waiting for me when I arrived at my destination. Pretty cool stuff!
459		Very convenient,professional.and affordable!
461		Amazing experience. So much easier than going to a doctor's appointment when you do not have the time to take from work for something simple as a cough or cold. Even with flu symptoms, I would choose PlushCare first before trying to get myself out of the house and wait in a waiting room while not feeling well.
463		Fast, convenient and affordable. Personable doctor that was knowledgeable. Nothing better than getting taken care of out of comfort of my own home when not wanting to leave home due to illness. Definately will use in future
465		Excellent services, wonderful physicians. As well as the schedulers.
467		I just used PlushCare and the service and over experience (Dr. Allan Wagner) were great.  Top notch medical care in the privacy of my own home.  I’ll definitely use them again.
468		Thanks Dr. Duque, you saved my mom and myself as her daughter, and thanks to the professional staff/Doctor who assisted me on the phone. I can tell that these are people who really care about patients' health.  Blessings and thanks.
470		I soooo appreciate saving time and energy when feeling ill by being able to use the Plush Care service. Wonderful experience!
471		Excellent service so convenient. Truly a wonderful experience
472		It was an awesome experience. So easy. The doctor ordered medication. So much easier than going to the doctor.
473		So quick and convenient to manage the inconvenience of common illness!
474		Love the care and each physician I have had contact with at PlushCare. I find myself much more satisfied than when I see my HMO doctors. The care has been excellent and I would return and recommend!
476		I was on vacation away from my PCP so decided to try PlushCare. My service came quickly and it was a great experience. I highly recommend using PlushCare.
477		Excellent service. Awesome experience . Don't even hesitate.
478		Best and easiest service ever!! Had my flu taken care of in my PJs!!
479		I got my prescriptions filled with no problems!!!
480		Finally, a way to see a doctor for renewing prescriptions!  I dreaded going to see my family doctor because I was exposed to others who wereill.  The last 3 visits I ended becoming sick, even though I was perfectlyhealthy before I went, due to poor ventilation, stagnant air and patients who were sick in the waiting room area.   In addition, no more waiting days to see a physician or having to goto an emergent center, just to get a prescription renewed!  I love it!Plan on using this great service a lot.  Highly recommend it!
481		Very convenient and always available. I had my doctors appointment on my way to work so I didn't have to take a day off and I got the medicine I needed.
482		I went with plushcare because I was feeling a sore throat early in the morning. I had just started a new job and my medical benefits had yet to kick in. For $99 I love how I got to choose my doctor and also see who else was available.  It was easy to upload the photos of my throat, speak to the doctor and get my prescription antibiotics started. I highly recommend using plushcare.
483		I was able to speak to a doctor and be en route to the pharmacy before my local urgent care even opened! The doctor made it really easy and I appreciated being able to get back into my weekend more quickly.
484		THIS is the way health care reform should be in the USA.Easy and a fair price.Every one should know about plush care.
485		So great to call and get seeing so quick.
486		Prompt, efficient, polite, warm and friendly
487		Was on vacation and out of state, was looking for an urgent care and came across their website. Sounded too good to be true and I thought I'd run into some issue. Thought I'd give it a try and scheduled an appointment for 8am that day! Amazing!!! I didn't have to wait hours in a urgent care or anything! One call with the doctor and my prescription was called in!! No waiting or hidden fees! Absolutely the best
488		Medicine and technology linked together , an awesome experience.  Sure beats sitting in a waiting room with who knows what disease in the air.  Great job.
490		Very easy to setup
492		I was too sick to make the trip to the doctors office, however, the care that I received through PlushCare was excellent.  (I worked at a Level 1 Trauma Center for forty-five years and I KNOW excellent care.)  I would not hesitate to call them again if need be.  Thanks PlushCare -
493		Straight forward, good doctor
494		Both times I have used Plush Care the physicians were very prompt, thorough and kind. Both calls took no longer than 10 minutes. I love using this service as I don't have to deal with spending a full day at the doctor's office. At most, i run into the pharmacy and I'm done. Plus, it's the same price as my doctor's office but way less hassle. Great service...
496		I've had nothing but the best experience with plushcare. All the doctors were so professional. They always asked the questions i forgot to ask. Its so convienant to book appt with the availability they provide and always called on time. Its the best.
497		So helpful!! Very professional & understanding, I was out of town & needed a doctor right away. This service is amazing, I highly recommend it!!
498		I had just gotten off a plane and arrived at my hotel very ill with a sinus infection.  The nearest urgent care was 40 miles away.  I had never used a call in urgent care before but I would use you again in a second.  The service was prompt, helpful, professional and I received the needed medication to make the rest of my trip comfortable.  What a great concept !Good job.  Thank you for helping me.
499		I was very pleased with my experience using PlushCare , Dr. Rudy was awesome.  I will and have recommended PlushCare.  I will have no reservations on using them again.  It was quick and easy and best of all no waiting at a doctors office and it is very cheap.  LOVE PLUSHCARE!!!!
500		This service is wonderful when you need help quickly.
501		"Moved to a New City almost overnight.No time to find a PCP. However I have to take 2 medications everyday. I only need annual check-ups in order to get a 1year supply of meds. While searching on-line for a General Practitioner. I found Plush Care. I was so impressed, (not a word i use lightly).I scheduled an appointment for the very next day. Dr. James, called me right on schedule.He asked me questions about my health.Some Questions, my previous doctor never asked. He explained why they were important. He was professional, courteous, very knowledgeable, (we spoke about various conditions). He was comforting, and caring.  Let's face it we do not always receive great """"bedside manner"""" by a physician.However Dr. James made me feel comfortable, While i was in my own home.I would, without a doubt recommend, PlushCare.Thank You Dr. James,Thanks to the Creators"
502		The customer service was great the doctor carefully listened and gave the best recommendation
503		Very easy to book. Very nice doctors. Excellent service. Would recommend it to family and friends.
504		I'M thankful that our Union brought you to us!!!
505		I was in a bad place.  My general doctor decided she wanted my Endocrinologist to prescribe one of my meds.  My Endo did not want to prescribe said medication.  As you can see this was an issue.  PlushCare saved the day!  I am so grateful to have found them.  Thank you to the Doctors at PC.
506		Last month when I could not get an appointment to see my regular doctor for days, I tried PlushCare. The experience couldn't have been better. From selecting my appointment time to the caring and knowledgeable doctor that I spoke with, I was impressed. I was able to gain piece of mind and be on the road to recovery much sooner with a PlushCare visit.The next day I couldn't wait to share my experience with friends and family.Thank you PlushCare!
507		I received more information, and fantastic tips, from the Plushcare doctor than I EVER have from any regular PCP I've had for my seasonal sinus infections. He was not hurried or seemingly distracted as my doctor always is. I didn't have to go into a germ filled office with my healthy children in tow. Great experience all around.
508		My Plushcare visit was awesome. No wait time, friendly doctor, and my prescription was sent directly to my pharmacy. It was very easy to use the Plushcare system. I had my appointment in my pajamas at home. you cant beat that!
509		East to use, fast service, no drive to the clinic, no wait.
510		This is the most convenient and cost efficient service around.  I loved my doctor, he was very thorough with his education and I felt very comfortable.  It was just what I needed, I would recommend this to all!
511		Wonderful service. I knew exactly what i had (I'd had it before).  Dr was understanding, and it was waay quicker than going to urgent care clinic 45 miles away.
513		I was abroad and holiday and PlushCare literally saved my life and my holiday :)
514		I found Plushcare while googling urgent care centers for poison ivy and was absolutely blown away by their level of care!  I was able to get a same day appointment and the compassion and medical knowledge they exhibited were beyond impressive.  It was a better experience than any in person medical visit I have ever had.  Seriously! I have recommended them to everyone I know and will definite use them again.
515		I have had Great Care from the doctors of Plush Care. I will use them in the future! So easy to get care from your home when you need it right away, love Plush Care!!
516		I love this company. The doctors and reception are always nice and respectful. THANKS
517		I knew I had a UTI and needed an antibiotic.  This was so much easier than using my primary or an Urgent Care.  Added bonus-much cheaper.
520		The team was great!  Someone as readily available on the phone to get information, and Dr. Dantes was prompt and very helpful.
522		I've used several Doctors so far, and all have been caring, honest and helpful. I don't have anything negative to say and I really don't care for dealing with Doctors. I would highly recommend, and very easy to make appointment and use.
523		It was a wonderful experience.  I had no doctors as I had just moved and the urgent care was closed.  I felt helpless until I found PlushCare!  It was such a comfort to know I had someone to turn to when I was not feeling well.
524		I am without insurance and need to get my needed medications.  The Doctor that talked with me was professional and caring and was able to prescribe the medication I needed.  She even sent my a prescription discount card which helped tremendously with the cost of paying out of pocket.  I can even call in my future refills as I need them.
525		"I had an upper respiratory infection and knew I needed antibiotics after it persisted (as it was not the first time I had this). I had just moved and had no local doctor yet and could not wait weeks for an appointment so called Plush. A very nice physician examined me """"virtually"""" and called in a prescription and I was on my way to recovery in no time. She was very thorough and attentive. It was a very good experience when I needed immediate healthcare.  Thank you!"
526		great service,excellent staff
527		Dr. was excellent. Process was easy and well thought out with reminders, instructions, etc. This was an easy process and I will be using the service again soon another family member. Call backs are prompts, scripts are called in quickly. Overall could not have been better.
528		I have recommended PlushCare to all of my Family and Friends!  Thank you for a wonderful experience!  I wish I could use this service for all of my Healthcare needs!
530		Doctor was knowledgeable and treatment effective.
531		PlushCare saved me at my best friend's wedding, when I woke up the day of the rehearsal with a terrible bug. The doctor called me quickly, was extremely responsive, and directed me to exactly what I needed to calm my symptoms. As I was enjoying the night on the dance floor after the ceremony, I thought about how grateful I was to PlushCare for saving such a special day in my life!
532		I have used PlushCare Urgent Care on three different occasions now and have received excellent care. All three occasions I was out of town. On vacation, at my Father's funeral and a wedding. These were stressful times being sick away from home. I was bound by time, location and access. The hotel first recommended PlushCare to me. PlushCare actually shows you the closest pharmacy. The doctors have all been professional, caring and thorough. I was able to make an appointment and speak to a doctor within an hour. This is an outstanding service and you should not hesitate to use their service.
533		Satisfied again and again
534		"I was blown away by the convenience and professionalism of this service. 100% loved it and will use it whenever it is appropriate! Seriously, the best interaction I've had with the medical community in years. Both doctors called on time and were knowledgeable, kind and courteous. I got exactly what I needed. The entire experience was excellent! THANK YOU from a very busy working mom who has zero time to sit around in doctors offices waiting for an """"appointment"""" and the doctor is two hours behind schedule. THANK YOU!!!"
535		My experience was excellent
536		The medical consultation was efficient, friendly, and professional. The doctor asked a series of questions to do her diagnosis and prescribe the proper medication for my symptoms. Shortly after I finish with the doctor I received and email to let me know that if I needed anything further to please call.This is the second time I have used the service and would not hesitate to recommend PlushCare to anyone as stated above.
537		"It was the weekend and PlushCare was so convenient and helpful!!   I was """"seen""""  almost immediately and had my prescription within an hour."
538		Patrick the customer representative who returned my call initially was very polite, knowledgeable, and courteous. Dr. Sargent who returned my call was excellent.  I was treated with concern, great knowledge and courteousness. Thank You
539		Great idea.  Not always easy or convenient to get to clinic when you're not feeling well.  Everyone I dealt with was great.
540		Always available, always patient. Especially when you can't get to your doctor or can't get an appointment for immediate care.
541		I loved the care very professional and quick
542		"Didn't have to wait long for my appointment (great!). Time on the phone with the Plush doctor was actually longer, a more thorough discussion of my concerns, than my experiences with my """"regular"""" doctor in his office (plus, no waiting-room time around coughing and sneezing people waiting to be seen.)"
543		I've used them coast to coast and would recommend to anyone who spends time on the road.
544		Me and my family have used this service many times and they have always been thorough and very efficent
545		Was a great experience.   Made my appointment online and was speaking to the doctor within the hour.  Had prescriptions picked up within two hours.   Super cool experience.   The doctor called me the next day to check and see how I was feeling.
546		I find this and excellent service.  Especially as I was on holidays and the GP o contacted did not take new patients.  My doctor ato plushcare listened, asked, explained,  gave advice and also git back to me a day later.Excellent
547		Awesome service, called right back, if there was a problem they fixed it immediately. Doctor was professional and to the point. Only problem was my state required a face to face and I was not told that so I had to reschedule- which they did for a few hours later that day. The picture connection would not work, so he called me and we continued because he had at least seen me. I told him what I needed and got the prescription in a hour.
548		As a mother of four I have appreciated this service and it's ability to save me time and give me the care I need. I suffer from severe seasonal allergies and I needed a prescription but my doctor could not see me for over a week. I called plush care and had an appointment with a doctor the same day and they called in my prescription for me. Within an hour I had the medication I needed and I was able to function again! The doctors were very thorough in their questioning me regarding my health. The cost is very affordable, the same as my out of pocket cost when I go to the doctor's office. I recommend them to everyone, I hope I never have to set foot in my doctor's office again, such a waste of time, exposure to so much illness and the offices charge an arm and a leg for cash paying customers like me.
549		The doctor was friendly, asked questions,and was able Help me get on the road to recovery.   Once given the proper medication, I was feeling better the next day
550		Plush care helped me get my prescriptions when i had no family doctor.
551		No non-sense service. Fast and easy
552		Calling urgent care clinics locally to be seen and treated in a timely manner,without success.The over the counter eyedrops for a pink-eye infection gave some relief for the symptoms,the infection was not going away,only getting worse.PlushCare may well have saved me an expensive emergency room visit as well being able to treat it immediately.Loseing the prescrption anti-biotic eyedrops added to my misery.The follow up consultation and prescription replacement were as important to me as the original.The doctor was friendly,courteous and highly professional,I felt at ease and in capable hands. There are times when one may need an ambulance and emergency room,but this time PlushCare was exactly what was needed for me!
553		Appointments are easy to find and the staff has always been great
554		This Company was there when I needed them. They always answered my calls and questions, and did what they could to make my experience comfortable. They made things right. They are people pleasers! Will definitely use the service again and recommend it! Thanks!
555		Was suffering from what was most likely bronchitis or waking pneumonia. Found PlushCare during an online search for local clinics. Doctor called on the dot, talked with me for fifteen minutes or so, I had a prescription for antibiotics at my local pharmacy within 40 minutes. Was feeling better within a couple days. Saved me finding a local doc, making an appointment, waiting for the appointment, getting dressed and going out, etc. I have already recommended PlushCare to friends and family.
556		I was so sick with a sinus infection , the Dr was fast in ordering my medication ! Thanks so much
557		Excellent service. Was a bit skeptical about using a MD through a website. I had just moved and did not have a primary care physician yet. Was about to go on a 12 hour deep sea fishing trip and needed an Rx for scopolamine patch. Picked my appointment time for call at home. Polite physician called on time. Asked a few questions about my history. Sent Rx directly to my pharmacy and had my meds within an hour. Would definitely use plush are again!
558		I have had rheumatoid arthritis for years and am successfully treated other than a very rare flare-up,  which requires treatment with corticosteroids.   A ten minute visit , $10 spent, and the Rx was at my pharmacy and a report to my doctor.  THANK YOU.  PLUSH CARE!
559		So fast and helped me out on a Sunday! The doctor answered all my concerns and was able to prescribe medicine so I could get back to feeling well!
560		We were on vacation when I became ill. I looked up my symptoms on WebMD and was fairly certain what my problem was. I then started looking for an urgent care facility, which there was none!  I noticed an ad for Plushcare and it seemed like a no brainer to set up an appointment. I chose a time and a doctor called me on the time requested. After a short conversation he drew the same medical conclusion I had reach red. He asked what pharmacy I would like and said I would receive an email within a couple of minutes of our hanging up. 30 minutes later I went to the pharmacy and picked up my prescription. All this and I didn't have to wait 7 hours in an ER!  I would do this again in a flash!
561		I've used PlushCare twice in the last year. So easy to setup appt. online, the Dr. called at the exact time I requested, she was very friendly and easy to talk to. She sent a prescription immediately to my local pharmacy as we were talking. Everything done within 10 mins! and I never had to leave home when I felt awful! Love this service and will definitely use them next time I need a Doctor.
562		everyone from customer service to help me with the appointment time to helping me set up the video  was most helpful . Dr. Marks was kind and was most helpful.
563		I was really nervous at first to use PlushCare but they were very helpful. Always on time, friendly, knowledgeable and cheap. I recommend this to all my friends & family who also started using Plush Care. Very thankful for the Doctors who have treated my family. It's an amazing service you provide.
564		Called them because my doctor was closed on a major holiday. Very helpful. Would reccomend without hesitation.
565		As a mom who has no free time we just moved to California I work 15 to 18 hours per day moving from out of state needed some regular medication refills to get me by until I get a permanent dr.The doctor was fabulous ask me every question in the book and prescribe me my refills without aggravation also turning out he knew I was sick over the phone prescribe an antibiotic hopefully I will feel better soon great job I wouldn't know what to do without your service
566		Great service
567		This service is for people who understand what's going on with their own bodies, because of numerous experiences. However, it is reassuring to have a doctor on call who will ask all the questions necessary to rule out something we have not considered. I appreciate this because I don't have to go to urgent care or sit in my doctor's office for long periods of time just to get a script I already know I need.
568		Positive experience and enjoyed talking to the doctor.This sure beats going to a clinic.I will use Plush Care again when needed.
569		I needed to get a prescription for an infection. They were prompt and efficient. I will use them again with no hesitation.
570		Correct diagnosis, the disease is cured in a week with the prescribed treatment in my case.
571		Plushcare is a great company.  So smart... it is such a hassle with or without kids to drive to the doctor, check in and wait forever just to see the doctor for 2 minutes.  With Plushcare you are given the option to video chat or talk or the phone with the doctor.  It's nice that you can lie in your bed looking or feeling like s%*! until you get the doctor call from the time slot you selected. If a prescription is needed they can call it in and you can be on your way to picking it up via a drive through. I also love that if you need to follow up down the road there is a grace period where you won't be charged.   It's a smart and savvy company that everyone will be using in no time. The fee is minimal compared to going into a doctors office. Convenient and affordable. I believe your insurance company can be billed too. Just give it a try next time you are feeling I under the weather, you will be glad you did.
572		I tell everyone at my site about how great PlushCare is!  They call on time,  no long waits and hassles like a walk in urgent care, about 10 minutes and done for non-serious issues!
573		I really like using Plushcare for easy things like renewal of my prescriptions. One less place I have to go and use gasoline for. The Dr. always has time to answer any of my questions. I'm so glad I found out about Plushcare online.
574		Poison ivy got intense. Glad not to have to go out and wait in a waiting room to see a doctor!
575		On vacation, 2000 miles from home developed a urinary tract  infection.Was given a quick appointment, a compassionate, competent physiciana prescription and directions to a drug store to fill it in a town I didn't know.It all worked; saved the vacation.  Very thoughtful, thorough, and compassionate.
576		I was in Maui on vacation   I had an allergic reaction to something n I was able to talk to a doctor within the hour and have the medication I needed before noon. Saved my vacation. THANK YOU!
578		The service is beyond comparison and the doctors are responsive to the patient's needs.  I have used Plushcare on more than one occasion and have no negative comments.  Keep up the good work.
579		The doctor whom I spoke with was excellent! She listened patiently to my symptoms and asked very good questions in regards to my past health history and current health issues. She offered some good advice and further encouraged me to follow up with my primary doctor and set up appointments for further testing .
580		This was by far the easiest experience I've had with any healthcare provider. Once I realized it was all done online! Made the appointment. Called the customer service with a couple questions, who were very friendly, set up the account and it was done. The doc called me at the scheduled time and we went from there. So easy! I've already reccomened to a few people!
581		Amazing service. Honestly a life a saver!
582		I happened upon PlushCare, used it, and quickly became a fan. I was hesitant to give it a try at first because it sounded so easy and I wasn't sure it was legit.  I decided to go for it, and I am glad that I did. It is not always easy to see a doctor in person, especially on weekends. PlushCare has made it so easy. You set an appointment, the doctor calls you back, asks you a few questions, diagnoses the problem and writes a prescription.  It's as easy as that!  I have told others about this amazing practice and hope they will use it. I know that I'm going to continue using it.
583		Very easy and prompt
584		I love that you can schedule a telephone appointment and the Dr is very prompt calling back. He was pleasant and very easy to talk to. He asked me many questions to cover everything dealing with my issue. The Dr was kind and friendly.
585		I was so lucky to find PlushCare at a time when I was out of town and very ill. I did not know the area so was leery of a walk in clinic. Within an hour I was in the phone with a wonderful doctor who immediately sent my prescriptions to a local pharmacy which I picked up ten minutes later! Relief was at hand. I called back the next week at no charge to follow up and have my course of treatment extended. The level of care and concern was second to none and I have already begun to spread the word about your amazing service!
586		I have used this serice twice now with excellent response and care. Both physicians that treated me were simply wonderful. I will continue to recommend Plush Urgent Care to anyone and everyone.
587		I love how easy and convenient it is to use.
588		I was traveling for work, out of network, and sick on a weekend.  I was able to get a correct diagnosis and medicine in only a few hours.  The doctor was friendly and very willing to talk about the diagnosis and treatment options.  The cost was affordable (and especially so compared to my other options).  PlushCare was so convenient and pleasant.
589		I had a very positive experience with PlushCare Urgent Care.  I was traveling and needed immediate help with a Urinary Tract Infection.  I didn't have transportation to a clinic so I found PlushCare online.  The Dr. was professional and was able to call in a prescription to a pharmacy within walking distance of where I was.  It went to smoothly.  I was extremely pleased.
590		I've used Plushcare about five times. Very convenient, you pick a time for you and no wasted time trying to get into your primary physician for an appt.
591		Plushcare was great!! They called when they said they would. The Dr.  was very helpful and prescribed antibiotics. I will definitely recommend plushcare.
592		The doctor made the experience comfortable and he help me get rid of skin problem that had been bothering me for a long time. I have recommended this service to many of my friends.
593		Easy to talk to and very professsional.  Love it that you can call back if the condition worsens or the mess aren't working and you aren't charged for that. Love this service
594		Doctors that I have spoken to, are knowledge and caring! Thank you!Plush care!Highly recommend your service!
595		I was out of town and didn't want the local urgent care!  This was Easy!  On-time!  I chose FaceTime call and it was perfect!  Doctor was Very thorough and compassionate!  Issue solved in one call!  And the discount Rx card saved me $10!
596		Caring staff
597		Medical staff is very professional. The provider called at the exact time of the appointment and prescriptions were called in promptly for customer convenience.
599		It was refreshing to talk to  a Physician who lisrens.
600		I found the doctor easy to speak to and very understanding of my condition he was able to articulate my condition and prescribed accordingly all together a very successful appointment and we could thoroughly recommend the plushcare clinic thank you
601		We were on the road and I had a terrible sinus infection. Couldn't find a clinic close by and saw plush care on line. The dr was kind, knowledgeable and professional! I would call again with no reservations at all.
602		I am a very busy business owner that does not have healthcare nor time to wait at a med clinic for simple treatments for small problems. Dr Rudy was very thorough and handled my problem very efficiently and effectively. Thank you so much!!!
603		Plush Care was amazing.  I was traveling and unable to get to my primary care doctor. They gave me prompt care and I was immediately taken care of.
604		I had had a UTI for a few days while we had been out of town for my mother-in-law's funeral.  I called my family doctor's office to see if I could get in the next day when I would be getting home but they were going to be closed.   I remembered Plush Care and decided to try it.   A Plush Care doctor phoned me in the morning at the appointed time, asked all the appropriate questions, and I picked up a prescription at my pharmacy just a little while later.
605		Same day appointment to see a doctor for an infected cut on my finger. The doctor was friendly and the service was a breeze to use. I didn't have to leave work and got a prescription for antibiotics. Saved me a trip to an urgent care facility!
606		I was hesitant at first that this was all I hoped for but it was exactly what I needed. I made the appointment online, the Dr. called right on the dot, we spoke of my symptoms for 7 minutes, he called in Rx to my local pharmacy. Easy, fast, convenient. I highly recommend!
607		Quick courteous service with prescriptions  sent to your local pharmacy for pick up
608		Diagnosis and treatment in an hour.
609		Excellent service and so convenient. The only problem I had was that they didn't accept my health program, Humana, and that makes it too expensive for me to use as often as I would like to.
610		Love Plushcare! Was recently sick, running a high fever, afraid to drive myself anywhere. Used Plushcare, and an hour later a friend picked up a prescription for antibiotics, and I was all good. Thank you!
611		Fast, efficient, easy, and even got a call back from the doctor the next day to see how I was doing.  Beats going in to the doctor's office any day for minor medical problems!!!Erica
612		It was nice being able to talk to the doctor over the phone and having an appointment time. It saved us from sitting in the ER for hours. I will be using Plush Care again!!!
613		Very easy, and fast.
614		Have used the service twice. Doctors were very prompt in calling and listened to my concerns. Very thorough in their questions to properly diagnose.
615		Ive used PlushCare a few times now, it's so  convenient when you don't have the time to sit in an urgent care or emergency room. The doctors really listen to you and probe for details about your health concern before prescribing any meds. I have told many people about this service and stand behind their practice.
616		No driving, no waiting. You can schedule your appointment in the comfort of your own home. Great service for minor medical needs. The doctors I've talked to seem very well informed and knowledgeable. saved me time and money!!!! Thanks Plush Care😊😊😊
617		Awesome service!
618		Doctor called at exact appointment time. Was very patient, easy to talk to, very knowledgeable.
619		Had a uti went online was provided with several Drs. in my area and several online appts. for the one I chose.  Tried to have a visual meeting with him.  Didn't work but he called me in an hour or so and listened carefully to me and prescribed medicine to the pharmacy of my choice. Was very pleased. I had insurance so that really helped. Came back to the site later and noticed that I could have received a discount on my prescription but too late had already picked it up.  Would have been nice if I had been told from the beginning this was a perk.
620		I have received thorough and professional care for recurring or urgent issues - such as U.T.I., and filling a prescription while on vacation. PlushCare doctors take the time to make sure their diagnosis and treatment are appropriate. It's much more convenient and cost effective than a brick and mortar urgent care.
621		Very easy and convenient.  I would really like it if you had an App for my iphone.
622		"From start to finish this was the easiest """"office visit'. So thankful I didn't have leave the comfort of my home, except to go get the medication I needed."
623		Wonderful experience !  Had the medicine within an hour !  Saved our vacation !  Thank You !
624		beats waiting in a doctors office
625		PROFESSIONALLY SATISFIED
626		I deal with the community on a daily basis. I have to tell you that with 20 years of working in the community. I have never dealt with such an efficient amazing doctors and it easy process to be seen for a toothache for an earache for a sinus infection for many different medical reasons. Also to do it by phone out  my home or on my computer for that convenience it's Irreplaceable you cannot ask for a better company or better service. Let's not mention my small co-payment.
627		Great doctor,and great service.
628		I have had nothing but great experiences with Plushcare. I love it and it makes life a lot easier.
629		Dr. Allan Marks is amazing! Doctors couldn't home with my migraines but he did in less than 10 minutes.
630		So fast, easy, efficient and better than Dr.s I have seen in person.  The Dr. listened to my issue,  offered a solution and it was one that worked. Well worth the money and much cheaper in the long run than dealing with a lot of unnecessary tests, etc...
631		No driving, no need to wait, no sharing the space with other sick people. Dr was great! Wonderful system!
632		Such a wonderful service. Helped me so much whilee on vacation. Dr. Rudy was wonderful!
633		Very fast and effective
634		I would recommend PLush Care to anyone!
636		Call was ahead of schedule, discussion was succinct, follow through items addressed in a timely manner
637		THE most convenient app ever.   It's a must have!   They have saved me time and money and the Dr.'s are on point.   Love them and highly recommend them.
638		Was nervous about using online doctor, but very professional and caring.   What I was dreading turned out to be a rewarding experience.   Dr was helpful and caring.   Would definitely use again.
639		Was traveling and had a gout attack.  Looking for an urgent care and found PlushCare via a Google search.  Downloaded the app, made an appointment and was having a videoconference with my doctor within an hour.  I would use this service again in a heartbeat!
640		Just relocated to the Sacramento area and haven't established new medical care. My daughter got a sinus infection and this service made a getting care very convenient that otherwise could've been much more difficult not knowing where to go.
641		PlushCare is a fantastic option to a time consuming in-office visit for non-emergency issues.
643		Great service I recommend
644		Easy, quick, and effective!
645		Finally, something in the medical industry that is beneficial to the patient and is cost effective. Thank you.
646		I have used plush care several times consulting doctors for different issues. I can say without hesitation that there are some of the finest doctors I have ever spoken with and are very knowledgeable.
647		This is the way of the future for light medical needs.
648		The Doctor I had the chance to visit with was helpful and knowledgeable.  Thank you
649		One Sunday, I called PlushCare about a headache that just wouldn't go away.  A doctor called me back about 30 minutes later.  I explained that the headache had started on Friday night, and still wasn't gone by Sunday morning. The doctor I spoke to asked me if it hurt to move my head or in bright light.  I said yes to both questions.  The doctor's diagnosis was migraine and he prescribed something that took care of it within an hour of me taking it.  I would highly recommend PlushCare!  Their service and knowledge are excellent!
650		Talk about convenience! Not only is this a moderately priced way to get help fast, the app is easy to use for anyone. The doctor was kind and helpful!! I was treated for strep within a day, and didn't have to be out of work too long because I caught this early and get the help I needed fast. If you're in any doubt, push it aside and give this a try, you will NOT be disappointed! and of course, feeling better in no time!
651		I work with kids and don't have time to not feel 100%, especially during the school year. Unfortunately, it happens more than I would like and normally, I have to schedule an appointment and hope that my doctor can see me after work. That is until I found PlushCare. My co-worker had used it and recommended it to me. At first I wasn't sure something so straight forward was even possible, but I was wrong. I downloaded the app, booked the next appointment during my lunch, and then had a prescription waiting for me at CVS. This is so simple and easy, I could not believe it.
652		I made an appointment online with PlushCare and it was simple and easy to use! Talking to the doctor over the phone and not having to make my way in for a visit to be diagnosed and treated was really convenient!
653		I appreciate the excellent service PlushCare provides over the telephone, especially because I travel so much and am not always able to physically go into the doctors office.  Dr. Wantuck was thorough and pin pointed exactly what I needed to heal up from a recent illness.  It's comforting to know that if I'm ill whilst on the road for work in the future, I can call on PlushCare!
654		Couldn't get in to my local doctor.  Found this place after a quick search.  Booked an appointment and was seen in less than hour.  Everything went well and I was prescribed what I needed.  This experience was infinitely better than my normal waiting 2 hours to be seen by a nurse or physicians assistant at my doctor's office.
655		This is exactly the sort of thing I wish someone had thought of years ago.  This way, I didn't have to wait in a waiting room and give other people my germs (and be exposed to theirs!) when I'm sick.  I just booked an appointment online, the doctor called and prescribed the appropriate medication.  Couldn't be happier.
656		Great service. Like most people, I hate going to the doctor, especially when i end up sitting in the waiting room for hours.  This eliminates that problem!
657		I had contacted PlushCare because I had a rash in an embarrassing location. By being able to video chat it made me feel more comfortable and I was able to get medicine and my rash cleared quickly. Thanks doc!
659		Had a very itchy a$$hole for over a week.  Did some googling and figured it was a$$ cancer or pin worms.  I didn't want to goto my local Dr. due to the nature of the simptoms.  I found Plush Care I was talking with a Dr. from Plush Care within a hour.  She recomened I change my diet to have more fiber.  After a week I was tottaly cured and didn't need any drugs.  I got saved me from a very embarassing visit to the ER room since my normal Dr. was booked for weeks.
660		I went to Plush Care for an upper respiratory ailment. Their diagnosis was spot on. And their attention to detail and care was far beyond what I typically receive at my local doctors office.
661		During a recent business trip to San Fransisco I came down with a very serious ear infection. Without having any idea of local doctors offices a quick call to my friend brought me to Plush Care, and the service was fantastic! Within an hour I had an appointment and was speaking with a great doctor. Service couldn't have been better, will use in the future, great company!
662		I found PlushCare for a UAT in the wee hours.  I clicked for an appointment, and the physician called right on the minute (I could have web cam, but don't have a camera).  He took a good history, then sent a prescription to my pharmacy.  The entire thing took 11 minutes (about the time your regular physician will spend with you), without the driving and the waiting.  NOT ONLY THAT, he gave me a special number to call for immediate assistance if anything was untoward.  Highly recommend.
663		Easy to setup appointment. Doctor was thorough with his questions and actually listened to everything i had to say. Very pleasant experience.
664		Plushcare saved me when I had strep throat.  I was new to town so I didn't know a good doctor off-hand.  As I was sick, I also wasn't in the mood to look up doctors and call around to a bunch of places and make appointments for who-knows-when.  I wanted to talk to a doctor quickly, and Plushcare came through perfectly after I stumbled upon it via a Google ad.  Within 30 minutes I was talking to Dr Mai Shiota, who was incredibly professional and attentive.  She wrote up a prescription, and 10 minutes later I picked up my antibiotics at the Walgreens downstairs.  The whole process from first landing on the Plushcare site to having antibiotics in my hands was less than an hour.  Plushcare is the way most simple medical issues should be dealt with.
665		This last weekend I was in New York for a close friends wedding and it was my first time to the city. On my fourth day there, my ear started to hurt, two days more and I couldn't handle it anymore.  Plus all the music and shrieking children didn't help at all. After searching urgent care on yelp I found PlushCare, their system seemed easy enough. I was able to make an appointment on my phone and get my prescription to cvs in about an hour. Im happy to say using PlushCare was well worth the effort.
666		After being sick in bed for days, not wanting to move -- I knew I should see a doctor, but nothing is worse than having to drag your exhausted body to the office. So, I did a quick search and found PlushCare. It was so convenient and I was diagnosed quickly so that I could start feeling better faster. The doctor was so considerate and each step of the way! 5-stars!!!
667		I was sick with a cough, sore throat and ear ache. I spoke to a doctor within 45 min. And I had my prescriptions within the hour. Thank you PlushCare and Dr Mark Allan for excellent service. I will recommend PlushCare to EVERYONE!
668		"I was sick with an acute bronchitis- but heavy like pneumonia. I have had asthma lifelong and the throat tickle started on Tuesday and by Thursday I had to abandon my camping trip- head home to recover.. My regular doctor would not let me """"slide in"""" (walk in) on Thursday and at 4pm the local urgent care had 20 patients ahead of me...and they close at 6pm. Looking on the computer for any local doctor...I came upon Plushcare??? Heck....Having no idea what to expect---called---had second thoughts---hung up.. They called me back hmm. The rest is good history...a quite thorough phone exam...a prescription sent into my local CVS... and it's Saturday and some very nasty stuff gone from my lungs and on recovery road. Dr Wantuck is on my """"rolodex"""" !  Thank You."
669		I am very happy and very much pleased with the PlushCare Urgent Care. Thank God there is this website available to speak a doctor asap that would prescribe medication asap. I highly recommend this to everybody. I already shared my experience with Plushcare to my friends and family and give it a try even if they have their own doctor already. This is perfect if you need a doctor right away especially when you can not reach your doctor yet or your personal doctor is on vacation. Please check the website.
670		Obtained an appointment quickly. Great customer service. US Doctor that I can understand. Affordable!! Caring Doctor. All around awesome service.
671		Dr. Rudy was prompt to call at the appointment time. He listened to my needs and responded with care and concern. I liked that I got to rest at home and not have to wait in an urgent care with other sick people. It really took the stress level down. The pricing was reasonable and I will most assuredly will use this service again! Plush is the Uber of the healthcare world! Thanks again!
672		Such a flawless system!  Was able to see a doctor immediately and my experience thus far has been overwhelmingly positive.  Great company, great leadership and a fantastic vision!
673		ALL I can say is that plushcare is amazing. I cant believe this hasn't been around longer it is in great need. I was treated by Dr. George Rudy for an awful infection. I don't have insurance right now and it was critical I got care. When my new insurance comes I am still going to use plushcare for these kinds of treatment. I have made a full and perfect recovery. He was so kind and helpful while taking as much time as I need to hear me out and treat with with excellent medical care. You can hear how smart and qualified he is while still being sensitive and kind. I didn't have to sit in an urgent care while being in extreme pain and discomfort and it was so quick and easy. The pharmacy was close and I am still so gratefuk for this service. Plushcare don't ever go away!!! Even the customer service that I called prior was extremely kind and helpful. FIVE STARS!!!
674		I was treated and picked up my antibiotics within an hour. All done over the phone. Very friendly doctor. They've earned a new customer for life.
675		I am so glad that I finally decided to give PlushCare a try. In fact, after my consultation with Dr. Nuwer I told myself that I should have called earlier. I was fighting an awful cold that didn't seem to get any better. She took time to ask me in depth questions and gave me options. Very patient. I felt that this was better than going to a doctor's office where I usually feel rushed after waiting forever in the waiting area. I feel so much better after I followed her treatment. I have the option of calling her back in five days if I feel that I am not getting better. There is no doubt that I will use Plush Care again. It was so easy to schedule a time to talk to Dr. Nuwer. I definitely recommend this service to anyone.
676		I discovered PlushCare while traveling.  I needed a prescription but was in route to New York and found their website by chance.  After a phone consultation with one of the PlushCare doctors, I had a prescription waiting for me when I arrived.  I have used the service, and the same Doctor, several times.  Even here at home I just schedule an appointment and receive immediate response and satisfaction.  My schedule is very busy and not having to sit in a waiting room full of other ill patients makes this service even better!  This is a unique service which I intend on using again and again.  Thank you, PlushCare!!
677		Seriously can't say enough great things about PlushCare. I had called my regular doctor this past Friday morning about a problem I was having and spoke to her staff team. After describing the problem, I was told that the doctor would give me a call by the end of the day. I waited all day for the call, that I never got. Finally, when I was close to giving up on Saturday morning I found PlushCare. I called and spoke with Casey and he was extremely helpful in booking my appointment to get the help i needed. I talked with the doctor and was sent a prescription to my local CVS all before noon. I am so happy that I found PlushCare and that I was able to get my question answered and get the help I needed quickly. I don't know that I'll be going back to my regular doctor after having such a great experience with PlushCare.
678		A sore throat turned into a 103 degree fever on a Friday night and there were no nearby urgent care centers that were open. I was a little bit wary of a company that provides health care over the phone but I was in a bind. I called and made an appointment. An hour later I spoke with the Doctor who diagnosed me with strep throat and prescribed antibiotics. I picked them up that night and by morning had turned the corner.I'm not sure if this is the best service for everyone, but it worked great for me.
679		Due to heavy work commitments, I was unable to see my primary care physician or visit an urgent care after hours.  From start to finish,  PlushCare delivered on their website promises.  The sign up process is easy and I was able to schedule an appointment that began 15 min later.  Dr. Wantuck called precisely 4:45 pm and was very easy to talk to.  He asked all the appropriate questions about my illness, medical history and current medications.  I was able to ask all of my questions and get clear answers.  He called in my prescription to a local pharmacy immediately after the call and also promptly emailed me lab test orders.  They use SonoraQuest labs in AZ and it was easy to complete the required tests the next day.  I was able to view my results online via Sonora Quest and had one abnormal finding.  I called the 800 number and Patrick was very helpful.  Dr.  Wantuck called me back in 15 min.  He explained the result and answered all my questions.  There was no sense on my end that he was trying get off the phone and move on to the next patient.  If can't see your doctor promptly, are too sick to sit in urgent care, or you have scheduling problems like I did, PlushCare is your answer!  I will use this practice again without hesitation!
680		Yes. I'M rating this 5 stars. At first I was very skeptical about the service. I initially went online looking to schedule an appointment with walgreens take care clinic to address the ongoing issues with my shortness of breath, wheezing and nothing but ongoing coughing. All this caused by bronchospasms that I was previously diagnosis with last year of 2014 when I went to the ER for shortness of breath and wheezing. I was prescribed an  Albuterol inhaler as needed for wheezing and shortness of breath. Months went by and I finally took my last puff on my inhaler. So I dealt with this for quite some time without a prescription because I had no insurance due to being laid off. One night I could no longer take after doping myself up on 75mg a night of benadryl just to help deal with my allergies and my shortness of breath so i decided I would go to the take care clinic and that's when I came across plushcare, I did extensive research and looked on BBB and saw that they were legit and a had alot of good reviews. So I took a chance because for one it would be cheaper than paying $100 plus other fees to go to the take care clinic and not having to go to the ER for sure would save me a lot of money. NOTING that when I went to the ER last year for the shortness of breath I racked up $592 in medical bills just to receive a nebulizer treatment and steroids. But with plushcare I paid $69 for my appt and $58 for my inhaler with a $10 discount plushcare provides you with or without insurance. I'm from Chicago, IL so I had the pleasure of having James Wantuck, MD as my doctor. He called me at the specified time I had set up, ask me very detailed questions regarding medical history, medications and so forth, he was very kind and understanding and even told me what type of environment to avoid given my condition. What I also liked most was his willingness to make sure that the medication prescribed was going to be effective and if it didn't work to follow up with him so we can go to plan B. So yes I will be using this service moving foward. I told my family, friends and coworkers about this. Pls understand this is not a scam. Don't knock it unless you have tried and if u knock it well to bad for you, but I have my solution for not waiting for hours or even days to see a doctor and saving money. So thank you Plushcare and most of all Dr. Wantuck.
681		came across PlushCare while searching for urgent care options in Oak Harbor, Ohio. I was not necessarily looking for treatment during my call. Instead I was primarily calling to determine whether I needed immediate medical care for a set of symptoms that could have possibly related to a serious medical condition. I tried getting in to see several local doctors with no luck that day, so this seemed a convenient and viable alternative.The scheduling process was easy (though be aware that the time zones on the schedule may be for CA time and not your own) and I received a call promptly at my scheduled time. So far, so good.But what REALLY amazed me was the quality of the interaction between my doctor and me. He listened carefully and didn't rush me at all. He asked questions directly related to my specific concerns. Once I finished presenting my symptoms and concerns, he asked great questions. I've noticed often that doctors do not pick up on nuances or listen carefully and end up jumping to conclusions instead.After I finished sharing my symptoms, Dr. Wantuck summarized which of my symptoms concerned him and which did not. Since I was trying to evaluate how serious my symptoms were, this was extremely helpful. He was sensitive, compassionate, and I could tell that he was taking my situation seriously.Being candid, I will say that I had a high level of skepticism about the online doctor experience. I questioned the credentials of the doctors that would provide service this way, and didn't expect such a satisfying, professional experience. I have recommended PlushCare to many friends and family since my first experience and will certainly use the service again in the future.
682		"I was on vacation in the bay area when I recognized the early signs of a UTI (sorry if TMI). All I can say is THANK GOODNESS my cousin knew about PlushCare. I called, made an """"appointment,"""" explained my symptoms to the PC Doc and got my prescription, all in less than a couple of hours. It was a no-nonsense, easy-to-use system and it was perfect for someone traveling, or who just doesn't have time to mess with making an appointment for a week from now when it's too late."
683		"A friend recommended I try plush care before going to the visiting my local doctor for a sore throat/sinus/sore ear drums that wouldn't go away. I signed up online and booked my appointment and was speaking with a doctor an hour later via phone. The doctor was extremely professional and courteous. I explained my condition to her and she asked me a couple of questions. After our 10-15 min conversation she had diagnosed me with a ear infection. My prescription for antibiotics was available for pickup 30 minutes later. This was the most simple and REASONABLE """"doctors visit"""" I have ever had. I hope to not get sick anytime soon but if i do, I will definitely use Plushcare again and recommend it to everyone I know."
684		I used PlushCare for the first time after being referred by a friend. It was easy and convenient, and I will definitely use it again.
685		I have been fortunate to be able to use PlushCare a few times and have always had a great experience.Skipping the 30 minute drive to the doctors office just to find out they are running behind and having to wait an hour makes PlushCare well worth the affordable cost. I have been diagnosed and prescribed medicine without even leaving my house. I have recommended PlushCare to all my friends and family and highly recommend it to anyone else. You will not be disappointed!
686		Couldn't be any happier with my experience. Great staff that was extremely helpful and accurate. Everything was done in a very timely manner!! Will be telling everyone and anyone I can about PlushCare!
687		I don't know you about you, but typically I find that I get sick over the weekends or when I am on vacation.  I was recently sick during a weekend and I had heard about Plus Care.  I thought, why not give this a try since I would have to pay a copay for an urgent care that would force me to leave my house. Anyway, I scheduled the call, I video chatted with the doctor and he called in a prescription for me.  This was all from the comfort of my home while I was in my PJ's.  Shortly after the call was completed, my husband went to the store to pick up my medicine and I got to stay at home, in bed, resting.  The doctor was understanding, efficient and provided me with the cold medicine I needed to get better.  Can't say enough about the great experience!!!!!!
688		Amazing service I loved how simple and fast and how I got to pick the exact time. Very helpful staff. I will send everyone my way here:)
689		I had a common medical problem and used plush care after a recommendation from a friend. I was a bit skeptical at first but it was a great, comceiment service. Setting up the appointment was easy and I spoke to a doctor that day from my home.
690		I was nervous at first with this being a scam. At the time I didn't have a car so I couldn't drive to the Doctors. I gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised how fast it was to schedule a phone appointment (45 minutes). I was able to submit photos to help the doctor. They were able to give me a prescription and my husband picked it up on the way home. If your nervous about this service, let me reassure you they're REAL, they care and are able to help and give prescriptions. This will always be my first option in the future. And you cant beat the price!
691		I googled Urgent Care and Plushcare came up but I didn't understand completely what they did, so I called for an explanation. I couldn't believe how easy it was to speak to a doctor so I booked an appointment. It didn't take long at all speaking with the doctor and within an hour I picked up my prescription. What a great idea and service. I definitely will be using Plushcare again. Thanks!Casey
692		Saved me from the agonizingly long urgent care visit. Was under the weather, with cold and slight fever and Plush care came across my google search. Tried it for the first time and the experience was amazing. After talking to the doctor from my home, the prescription was filled and waiting for pickup at the nearby CVS. Can't imagine why i haven't tried this before. Definitely the future!!
693		Quick response, and great to be able to make an appointment instead of sitting in a virtual or real queue. Doctor called promptly at the scheduled time, asked detailed questions and understood the issue I was experiencing. I felt that I received the same, if not better, exam compared to a traditional urgent care center without having to drive across town, wait and end up paying more than the PlushCare fee. Obviously this service isn't going to help when you need stitches, but seems like a great option for any condition that can be described over the phone without need for a physical exam or intervention from the treating physician.
694		Here I am at home with a sick son and not feeling well.  I didn't know what I was going to do since I had a pretty good idea that my condition required antibiotics.  The last thing I wanted was to take my son to a walk in clinic and wait four hours to get a prescription.  I went online and searched for clinics nearby and came across the add for Plushcare.  At first I was skeptical, but when I read their website information it made perfect sense and was an answer to my dilema!  I made an appointment online and within a half hour I was on the phone explaining my symptoms to the doctor.  Within two hours I had my prescription and was able to relax and take care of my son.  Everybody is so busy these days and I can only speak for myself when I say that having an option like this is a HUGE help amd stress relief.  There have been times in the past that I have been in a similar situation and had gone a week before i was able to seek medical care.
695		I travel often on business and, unfortunately, am prone to sinus infections. I can't tell you the number of times I've been faced with severe sinus congestion and a mandatory business trip within the next couple of days. In the past it's been nearly impossible to see a doctor in time to address both my health and business needs, and I've been forced to travel with severe sinus or ear pain.  But now, PlushCare has developed the perfect solution.  Having top-quality healthcare available when an illness strikes is what we all need -  in my case, it's absolutely essential. Thank you PlushCare!
696		I highly recommend this company.  I wait an average of 2 weeks to get an apt with my doctor, or my kids pediatrician. Then I wait in a crowded waiting room for sometimes hours, just to see the doctor for 5 mins. My husband found Plushcare.com at 7:15 am, and I was talking to an actual doctor at 9:15am, the same day. They even called in a prescription for my sinus infection to my pharmacy. It was quick, convenient,  and extremely helpful. I have already told my friends and family about plushcare, and will continue to spread the word. I'm so glad my husband found this company!
697		My experience with PlushCare has been more than satisfactory. It's comfortable, because the doctors are all trained from top-tiered schools like UCSF and Stanford, and their professionalism clearly reflects it as well. The cost of ALL visits (they'll keep seeing you until you've solved whatever it is you called in for originally) was $45, which is so much cheaper than the actual copay of urgent care firms. And the people working at the company were super friendly in receiving feedback about my experience and how they could improve the process. Great company, great service—really excited to see it expand geographically!
698		This was the easiest doctors appointment I've ever booked. I was able to make an appointment for the same day, talk to the doctor and get the help I needed. This is something that I will definitely use in the future and recommend to my friends and family.
699		I am a business traveler who lives in Florida and commutes to the Bay Area for work each week.  Yesterday I realized my allergies had turned into a sinus infection, and by last night I realized it was a BAD sinus infection.  I went online to search for Urgent Care locations close to my hotel, and PlushCare was an option that came up.  I clicked on the link, and intrigued, I decided to book an appointment for a telephone consultation.  I figured that if it was too good to be true--and I was convinced it would be--I could then leave to go find a bricks-and-mortar urgent care location.PlushCare DELIVERED on their claims.  The physician called me within two minutes of the appointed time, and I received a confirmation phone call shortly after booking the appointment.  Within 10 minutes of finishing my conversation with the physician, I checked my CVS mobile application and my prescriptions had been received and were being filled.$40 copay on my insurance for a visit to an Urgent Care with a lengthy wait, as opposed to a $49 fee for a phone call consultation in the location of my convenience and a speedy course of treatment?  Done.PlushCare has a very satisfied customer who will use them again if I have a problem they can help me with.
700		I was visiting Lake Tahoe and none of their urgent care centers are open on Sunday.  I knew I had a sinus infection stemming from a virus that would not go away. The doctor was very thorough in my diagnosis, making sure that his treatment would be the correct one.  After one day on the antibiotics I felt human again. I was able to start my recovery without having to wait until a weekday and did not even have to leave the house.
701		I am on a business trip across the country from home and woke up with a wicked UTI. I'm not familiar with the Coronado area and really didn't want to go to an urgent care or ER and contract something worse. I was hopeful when I found this company on a Google search but didn't believe this service could be true until Dr. Obrien called me on time. We talked for 12 minutes and he called in a prescription to begin my healing. He even called me later to see how I was doing. I'm so thankful and already feeling better. I would recommend this service to anyone. Thank you.
702		My daughter had a cough and wasn't feeling well and my ex-wife decided to drop it on me in a text. I called urgent care and they didn't have an appointment available until four days out.  When I goggled urgent care to find a different location I found PlusCare. I figured $10 bucks in gas, $15 deductible, 2-3 hour wait, hanging out with a bunch of sick people; or making dinner, helping with home work, and going about our evening as planned. It was a no brainer! My Daughter thought it was REALLY COOL !  Doctor Miller called us right on time. W H A T !   yes, right on time. We then went into a video chat and after several minutes Doctor Miller was able to decide what was the best remedy for the situation. My Daughter asked how long do you think it will be before you can x-ray, do blood pressure and temp over the CPU. I would think sooner then we think. This is the way of the future and I am glad we were able to use PlushCare, Thanks Google. Another great point to make is Dr. Miller spent more time we us then most doctors have in the past, We didn't feel rushed ! Thank You Dr. Miller ..
703		I had been sick for three days and wasn't getting better. I knew I needed antibiotics but the thought of getting out of bed and driving myself to the doctor was inconvenient. I googled urgent care and plush care came up. For $45 I have it a shot and I am glad I did. It saved me a lot of money and hassle. Highly recommend it. The doctor was knowledgable and knew right away that I had strep throat. :-)
704		"My daughter had tonsillitis.  I knew it was tonsillitis because of the temperature on the thermometer and the nasty white stuff on her tonsils.  I've seen it before.  I knew she needed antibiotics.  But to have to run out to urgent care with a sick kid...not good.  Plus, it's very expensive.I decided to look online for a """"new urgent care"""" for my sick daughter, and stumbled across PlushCare.  I thought it was too good to be true.  Handle the situation over the phone (or video chat if you like?).  $45?!!  If it worked, it would be the best thing ever.  I made an appointment, put in my daughter's info, and the doctor called right on time.  She was very cheerful and professional.  She spoke with my daughter for a few minutes and that was that.  She double-checked with me regarding allergies to medicines.  Within an hour I had antibiotics in my hand and could get my daughter on her way to recovery, without her ever having to leave her bed.  Thanks for this wonderful service!"
705		Easily one of the best services I have used. Seamless end to end, super fast, if I could rate this service higher I would. Doctors were punctual, professional, and I was diagnosed in no time.
706		First off...I never write reviews...but I am today, I do, to sing the praises of Plush Care!!!   Soo nurses are infamous for going to work sick..I had a bad case of the flu, went back toooo work too early and developed symptoms of a uti.  I couldn't miss any more work and found PlushCare on line bout 50 minutes before my shift!!!!  I signed up, called and was able to get a phone appt with Dr George Rudy for 230pm.  I spoke to him on my way to work and he called in a script , with a coupon and I started on the med and my symptoms are gone and I'm feeling so much better!!!  Dr Rudy was very professional and immediately took care of my problem!!I would highly recommend this service to any of my colleagues..it is a quick and inexpensive way to be treat a known problem!!!  No waiting for an appt, or in urgent care for antibiotics.  I am beyond satisfied and am so grateful to Dr Rudy and the service that PlushCare offers!!!
707		I'm very please with this service. Dr. Marks was very nice and professional. His diagnosis was good resulting in my quick recovery.  Thank You.
708		George was thorough, caring and knowledgeable. Being VERY wholistic myself, I liked that he recommended every possible remedy before resorting to drugs. I love the free follow up if necessary, and saved AT LEAST $165 over a walk-in clinic. I will definitely use them again if I have the need to.
709		"Dr. George Rudy was not only pleasant and efficient but also professional and courteous.  When it became obvious I had a bladder infection I was DREADING going to the doctor or urgent care....two hours of wasted time to pee in a cup and have the doctor then say, """"Yup...you have a urinary tract infection...""""  Dr. Rudy asked specific questions, was thorough in explaining  what I needed to do to deal with the discomfort and then called in my prescription to a pharmacy 1 block from where I lived....all from the comfort of my home!!!!!!  Great service, and I'll be using it again!!!!"
710		"WOW! What a great service! It;s obviously convenient & inexpensive, so the only wild card is effectiveness. For me it was EXTREMELY effective!Dr. George Rudy was extremely attentive, & quickly determined that my severe side pain was likely """"muscular-skeletal"""". (A relief, since some of the the possibilities I Googled were pretty scary.) He prescribed a muscle-relaxant & sleeping med, & gave me great advice. He even checked local pharmacies to find the best price! (I paid $11 at Target.)3 1/2 hours after my appointment I fell into blissful sleep. I awoke almost 13 hours later, feeling refreshed and with manageable pain. (My routine lately has been to knock myself out with sleeping pills and wake up 4 hours later, when the pain overcomes the drug.)At first I was disappointed that he can't prescribe strong pain-meds without a physical appt.. Now I'm convinced that the regime he advised is much better. It's a little more complicated than just popping a pill every few hours. Pain serves a purpose though. Now I have manageable pain that reminds me to take it easy & let my body heal, but still allows me to function reasonably... and SLEEP.Thank you, Plushcare, for providing a unique & valuable service. And thank you, Dr. Rudy!"
711		Dr. Marks was professional, courteous, and explained every step of the process. He even went out of his way to find a 24 hour pharmacy in my area to send my prescription to. He went above and beyond my expectations. Patrick at the call center was also very helpful with setting up the appointment.
712		Hi:I just want to inform you that I had a WONDERFUL experience with Plushcare and Dr. Wantuck.  He spent more time with me than my regular primary care doctor.  I did not feel rushed and my prescription for the sinus infection was called in immediately to my pharmacy.  I get sinus infections every spring and Plushcare will be my new medical service for this condition.  Thank you so much for starting this company.  You are awsome and I will spread the word!!
713		I was very impressed by Plushcare. They were prompt, thorough, and the Dr. was pleasant. My Rx was called in immediately. I couldn't ask for a better urgent care service.
714		Wow! I happened to see PlushCard on a search for urgent care in my area. I had already called an urgent care in my area where I spoke to an obviously overwrought and stressed employee who was rude to me on the phone. I was ready to drive 30 minutes to a minute clinic at CVS to avoid a 2 hour wait while being surrounded by others who were just as sick as me. I was pleasantly surprised by the easy and straight forward treatment by the employees and doctor at PlushCare. Within one hour of contacting them, I had a consultation, diagnosis and prescription called into a pharmacy near me for $45. The doctor also gave me instructions for home care which were very helpful. As a healthcare professional, I appreciate the fantastic professionalism accompanied with just good old fashioned care and compassion. PlushCare you got it right! Thank you and I will be referring the people I love to you as well!
715		Tried calling my regular doctor who only had an appointment 2 weeks away.  Instead called Plushcare and scheduled a appointment, talked with a doctor, and got a prescription all in ONE DAY!  Finally technology has caught up with modern medicine to make the entire process quick and easy.
716		The Dr. I communicated with was very attentive and was more then willing to help. The process was fast and had my result instantly. The doctor demonstrated great people skills and showed vast medical knowledge. I would recommend the service to anyone. I live a very busy life and do not get sick often so when I do it was nice to not have to schedule and appointment and wait to be seen. Excellent service.
717		I recently traveled to California for a vacation and decided to drive to Napa Valley to see the scenic views.  While driving the countryside with friends, I became extremely nauseous.  After being unable to find a doctor in the Napa area that would see me on such short notice, I utilized Plushcare at the suggestion of a friend. And, I am SO glad I did.  Within minutes, I was speaking to a knowledgeable and professional doctor about my nausea and vomiting in the privacy of my hotel room. After a thorough discussion, the doctor prescribed me medication to a drug store down the road that truly saved my weekend vacation.  I would recommend Plushcare to everyone and wish there was a similar alternative available in Pennsylvania.  California residents are truly lucky to have Plushcare.
718		They were very concerned about my problem. I drive large vehicles, and they even found places along my route that I could park in. Had to have 3 different meds phoned in and there was no problem. Everytime I was in a different state and no sweat it was called in and buy the time I got there it was to
719		Great experience! I'm new to Plush Care. A friend passed along info about their recent Indiegogo campaign and I contributed, which got me a membership. I used it the other day for the first time and was not disappointed -- in fact, I was impressed! I usually get a sinus infection at least once a year and have to take an annoying trip to the doctor's office just to get a prescription for something I already know I have. I decided to give Plush Care a shot and it was way more convenient. In the end, I got the prescription I needed without the hassle. Looking forward to more visits.
720		Going to the doctor has always been a pain for me so this service is awesome. I've also subscribed to it for my children through the Indiegogo campaign but have not yet needed to see one of their pediatricians which I'm confident will be just as great and it provides me with a sense of security.
721		I couldn't believe how quick and easy it was to create an account and schedule a same day appointment! Best of all, I was feeling back to normal before the first available appointment with my PCP. Thanks PlushCare!
722		As a sales executive I'm constantly on the move and my schedule has never aligned well with making doc's appointments. I recently caught pink eye and the PlushCare team diagnosed it and provided me with a prescription from my hotel room. Phenomenal and will be using them for here on out!
723		Plushcare is a hard working team that's focus is always on you.  The team is constructed on professionalism, integrity, and perfection.  During the whole process, you truly feel that you are being taken care of and your time is being respected; I would recommend Plushcare to my mother.
724		I am impressed with the quality doctors that are accessible through Plushcare. The quality care coupled with ease of use makes this a winner!
725		Plushcare has been a fantastic and convenient resource for anything health care related! Doctors are easily accessible and it's been a flawless process since the beginning.
726		PlushCare's service symbolizes the blend of modern technology and medicine. Many working professionals such as myself have little time to go to a doctor's appointment, let alone wait for a consultation. PlushCare is efficient, and I can consult a top-notch doctor at a time that works for me without the need to wait. The service is affordable, efficient, and secure. You can't ask for anything more - highly recommend this to everyone!
727		They took the time required to understand my specific condition and were able to suggest a personalized course of treatment. The entire visit (virtual) inspired confidence and I will return to this company without hesitation.
728		My biggest deterrent from addressing medical issues is the inconvenience and hassle of delays and waiting at a doctor's office.  During my virtual appointment with a Plush Care doctor, the doctor was prompt and friendly, then listened, diagnosed and resolved my situation.
729		What a great service!  I'm so glad to have PlushCare.  I can now see a doctor on my schedule without the hassle of waiting in a room full of sick people.  No more waiting or taking time off work for appointments.  Thanks PlushCare!
730		I am constantly on the road for work, and happened to be on the east coast (In the middle of nowhere) a while back when I came down with a sinus infection and needed antibiotics. I was complaining to a friend about the inconvenience of searching for a doctor. She tipped me onto Plushcare, and there i was able to make a same day online appointment with a reputable doctor. i received my prescription and was back and ready to go. I highly recommend  using Plushcare anytime, anywhere.
731		Great product, great service, can't live without them.
732		I trusted the doctor and appreciated the fact he gave me his educational credentials before starting.
733		Instead of packing up the kids and heading down to the Doctors office and waiting around for an hour, I just made a simple phone call and talked to the nicest Doctor. After hearing my symptoms, the Doctor was able to diagnose me quickly and send a prescription to a pharmacy nearest my home. Such a time and money saver. Great experience!
734		Plushcare was suggested to me by a friend when I was complaining about trying to get an appointment at my doctors for a routine visit. It was easy to sign up for and I got to talk to the doctors on my schedule. Definitely something I would use again in the future.
735		I heard about Plushcare through friends and decided to give it a try.  With a demanding work schedule and little time to myself, I found it extremely helpful and reassuring to know I can contact a doctor without having to set apart time not only for the appointment but travel time to and from the office as well.  Not only is it convenient but the interaction with the physicians is professional and is an overall great experience.
736		Wow! what an awesome company.  I have had sinus infections in the past and know exaclty what I need for them.  AN ANTIBIOTIC! It's always a pain to get them since my doctor won't provide me a script unless I make an appointment, pay co-pay and come see him face to face which is totally unnecessary and annoying.  Thank you PLUSHCARE for making this simple.
737		A friend passed along this new service to me, and I'm happy I found out about it. I usually get a sinus infection at least once a year and have to take an annoying trip to the doctor's office just to get a prescription for something I already know I have. I decided to give Plush Care a shot and it was way more convenient. In the end, I got the prescription I needed without the hassle. Really happy I didn't have to waste my time standing around the doctor's office.
738		This is a great service to deal with those minor and unexpected health issues that arise. The time it takes to get an appointment with my primary physician seems like it's getting longer and longer these days. Sometimes you just need antibiotics for a very rudimentary issue and it can be such a nightmare of a process trying to get treatment. Plushcare can save you time, money and a headache. I would definitely recommend trying it out. There's nothing to lose because they offer your money back if you're not satisfied, which is pretty cool.
739		I am swamped at work and I have no time to go to the doctors.  I had this nasty cold for over a week and I knew it was a sinus infection.   My friend told me about Plushcare and I signed up a couple months ago thinking this would suit my lifestyle perfectly.  It was the best investment ever!!!!!  I called and the doctor called back in no time.  I described my symptons, and I get sinus infections frequently.   The next thing I knew, I was driving down the street to Rite Aid to pick up my perscription.   I did not have to miss any work and I was better before the weekend.   Everyone I talked at Plushcare was so helpful and professional.  They made me feel like they were there for me. You got to do this!
740		I hate going to the doctors so this for me is PERFECT. Most of the time I just have a cold or something easily diagnosable.... so this service has been super helpful.
741		A friend had recommended that I sign up for Plush Care. I called to make an appointment and got a representative that provided a high level of customer service. The representative was very professional and answered all my questions quickly and professionally. I made my appointment and it went great. I loved how easy it was. Great Company & Concept! I will recommend to all my friends and colleagues.
742		I am a Consultant who is constantly on the road for work. When I came down with the flu and was across the country, I needed access to a doctor quickly. Although I generally rely on reviews from family and friends to pick a healthcare professional, I was far from home and needed a service I could trust to get me into the right hands. Enter Plushcare! I was able to make an appointment online and speak to a reputable doctor the next morning. I will certainly be recommending Plushcare to my coworkers who are more often away from home than in close proximity to a family physician.
743		I heard about Plush Care thru their Indiegogo campaign. I contributed and received a membership. I used Plush Care for the first time when I experienced a leg cramp while jogging. I spoke to a Plush Care doctor who was very personable and well informed. The doctor gave me a prescription for an anti-inflammatory, which I had filled at CVS. The entire process was easy and hassle free.
744		I made an appointment online and spoke to a fantastic doctor from the comfort of my home. He sent a prescription to Walgreens for immediate pickup. I would recommend this medical care to everyone for urgent care type issues.
745		I found out about PlushCare when doing a Google search for a nearby urgent care. I at first thought there was no way they could make seeing the doctor this easy and it had to be a scam. However, I gave it a try because the team had extremely reputable backgrounds from places like Stanford and UCSF. It wasn't a scam and it was just as easy as they said it would be.

8		I replied to a message from my doctor about private medication information and it was intercepted and replied to by someone at Plush.  I replied thinking it was my doctor and the response I got was from yet another Plush representative telling me to set another appointment and pay another fee to speak with my doctor.  I feel like they are breaking HIPPA laws butting in to my conversation with my doctor.  Looking for a different service.
51		I like the concept of Plushcare a lot. The Doctor I choose as my primary is fantastic. What Im not happy with is if something is wrong, such as, your prescription is misread and or inputted incorrectly and the pharmacy needs it corrected or has questions and you send a message to plushcare to resolve it it may take 24 to 48 hours to be resolved. This is completely unacceptable and needs to be fixed! There needs to be a way for a pharmacy to be able to contact the doctor quickly.
161		They charge a monthly fee for their services & the doctor I had prescribed a medicine that didn't work so I had to schedule another appt with another Dr. & had to pay another $30 deductible. I canceled their service!
254		I will give this two stars because all doctors were nice to talk to.  However, since experiencing this online care, it seems like a fiverr for doctors.  You'll go through a list of them because you can never find the same one in the new rotation, at least I never did.  Further, after speaking with a few different doctors, you're always encouraged to contact them, text through the app, email them back after the appointment if you have questions.  None of them replied.   That's it for me. Canceled and demanded a refund.  I now realize it basically urgent care online until you get your own solid insurance. Healthcare is changing rapidly so there are so many options.
256		took my money, said that my problem was to much to deal with.  i asked for a referral to someone else and the response was. set another appointment.  so basically pay again. so 200.00 just for a denial and maybe a referral? i feel scammed . Now its been two days ive been hiking through a national forest. maybe another two until i reach a real Dr. 135 miles im hiking when all i needed was some antibiotics. I do not recomend you use this if you have anything more then a sunburn, or a refill on your pain meds. even thats iffy. good luck. dont die like me. just get to a real Dr first.  The receptionist was really nice though. she actually was concerned.
269		"Gold Stars for physician quality based on my experience w 2 Plushcare MDs in 2019. But Red Flags for Plushcare's sneaky """"monthly membership"""" fee, $9, a 'membership' I never authorized, but they've been skimming from my bank acct since my second and last appointment, 12/2019. Not cool. Now cancelled (with confirming email, which is more than I got confirming 'membership).' No trust. Will change bank acct too. Hassle."
288		"I've been using PlushCare for over a year and it had been wonderful, and the convenience and the doctor I usually see has been great.  I've never been charged a """"subscription fee"""" in that time until this month when I noticed $14.99 on my credit card.  I searched my spam and trash to make sure I didn't miss a notice of this new fee, and didn't find a single thing.  This is fraud to start charging a subscription to existing customers without notice!  Then I investigate, there is no way to cancel in the app and it took me quite a few minutes to figure out where it was on the website.  Your service has been great, but I'll probably be looking elsewhere now due to these shady practices."
299		I left a message for someone to contact me back early in the day.   Computer message said someone would call me back when a representative is available.  Its many hours later and still no return call.  I would like info about a test I took.   Thank you
350		I was disappointed by Dr Christina Garcia  brief chat.It lasted maybe forty seconds....She called late for my Three PM visit and her follow up inquiry was three day later.Apparently she has weekends off and was not available for a quick question regarding pain relief.I asked if I could take ibuprofen for pain but she got back to me three days later as mentioned and I thought this was unkind.Tylenol would have been an appropriate answer instead of ibuprofen which caused inflammation.She is a poor Doctor in my opinion and I would not and will not use your service again.I certainly did not get my money’s worth and her “bedside” manners are uncaring and I am not a fan of hers st all.Thanks but no thanks on Posh  Care and Dr Garcia.
382		My lower back felt like it needed support floating. I had a terrible headache and backache the next day.
407		The doctor that i talked to, talked to me like she was doing me a favor. She was a bit confrontational i believe that she thought that she was the employer and i was the employee and not the other way around.
512		The follow up appointment they told me to see a doctor in person. When I called back they said that I already had my follow up and they'd call me back and didn't call me back.

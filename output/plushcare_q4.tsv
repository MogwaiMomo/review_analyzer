1		I booked an appointment with dr.Lovell. We started the appointment and I couldn’t hear her so she said she would call me.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CALL AND ITS BEEN AN HOUR SINCE THE APPOINTMENT.  Then she proceeded to send me an appointment summery when WE NEVER HAD AN APPOINTMENT.  I’ve been on the line waiting for customer service for about 20 minutes and no one is answering.  DO NOT recommend and I do NOT recommend dr. Lovell
2		I joined my appointment and waited almost an hour and no doctor showed up. I called the number on their site and after about 6 minutes someone picked up. They informed me the doctor that was supposed to see me had a power outage, but no one got in touch with me about this. Canceled my membership right away and won't be using again.
5		I saw that this had great reviews and figured that I would give it a go. Unfortunately I did not have a pleasent experience. I waited for over half an hour for my doctor to show up to the appointment and he never did. I called the phone number on the website as it told me to, and no one ever answered. I had to leave a voicemail. Overall I am very dissatisfied with this service and will not be using it again. Am going to be trying out a different site, ZocDoc, which doesn't need a membership to have an appointment. Hoping to have more luck there. I have no idea why this plushcare has so many great reviews.
6		Please be AWARE of recurring monthly charges! I take responsibility for not reading the fine print and only realizing after their second charge for 15 dollars in 2 months. My appointment was easy and I got a prescription I needed at the time. I didn’t even ask them to make it right and they did. I’ve come back to edit and give more stars because I really am impressed at this.
7		I replied to a message from my doctor about private medication information and it was intercepted and replied to by someone at Plush.  I replied thinking it was my doctor and the response I got was from yet another Plush representative telling me to set another appointment and pay another fee to speak with my doctor.  I feel like they are breaking HIPPA laws butting in to my conversation with my doctor.  Looking for a different service.
8		So far I’m not getting refills on my Rxs so I’ve had pay for another virtual doctor appointment. I’m going to contact my pharmacy for them to request Rx refills so I don’t need to pay for another doctor appointment. I use my HSA so it does use that money which I’d prefer to keep in my HSA for future use now that we know my Rx is working well for me.
10		I needed a prescription refill and don't have a regular doctor since i lost my job at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I was very hesitant to actually go into an urgent care when I found PlushCare online.  Dr Wu was very helpful and asked the pertinent questions regarding my medication.  She also assisted me in getting follow-up bloodwork that I would be needing in the coming new year.  I was so pleased with how my virtual appointment went that I requested Dr Wu to be my primary care physician.
20		I was offered multiple different appointment times, even for the current day, by multiple doctors. I could see their picture and all the reviews for them. The doc I chose was not only extremely helpful, her bedside manner is very compassionate and genuine. She gave me as many options she could think of to solve my issue. I would recommend this to all my friends and family to use, whether you have insurance or not. Thank you for this tremendous service during a difficult time!
30		I had Covid-19 from February '20 to August '20.  Plushcare help in:1) Diagnosing the virus and directing me to medical assistance2) The medical assistance provided me with a new scientific formula and steroid that finally turned the virus around in 24 hours3) Has provided me with RX's that have fended off the residual effects of Covid-19, i.e., acute Bacterial Bronchitis and acute Viral Bronchitis 4) And has followed up on my care and results consistently.Thank you Plushcare for being there for me when the doctors office told me that should I come into their office with Covid-19 they would have me arrested for trespassing.  I can always count on you!
35		Extremely convenient and efficient. As someone who travels constantly and has a frequently changing schedule, it’s comforting to know I can book an appointment at my convenience when needed and interface with a doctor who will order labs, renew my prescriptions and contact me with my results. I found the physicians to be caring and thorough. As a former RN, I was very pleased with the care I received.
37		I wanted a convenient and reasonably priced option for visiting a doctor without having to go to an in person visit. As someone who usually uses urgent care, this site offered everything I was looking for. I easily set up an appointment and met with a doctor. The doctor was wonderful and was able to quickly find solutions that worked for my ailment. I am so glad that this option exists for us. I will be using this site again for any future ailments.
44		I am very happy to have found PlushCare. Someone who has not seen a Dr. in many years it is hard to find a Dr. in my area that will except a person with out insurance. I am going to be 65 in March and have been waiting for my medicare to become effective. Not only is PlushCare affordable for me but I found a Doctor who listens to me. I will be using PlushCare for as long as possible. Thank you for being here.
50		I like the concept of Plushcare a lot. The Doctor I choose as my primary is fantastic. What Im not happy with is if something is wrong, such as, your prescription is misread and or inputted incorrectly and the pharmacy needs it corrected or has questions and you send a message to plushcare to resolve it it may take 24 to 48 hours to be resolved. This is completely unacceptable and needs to be fixed! There needs to be a way for a pharmacy to be able to contact the doctor quickly.
53		I am so happy to have this service available to me.  The doctor was friendly and efficient. I needed a refill on my prescription as I had moved to a new state and hadn’t yet found a new doctor. She asked me the relevant questions and spent about as much time with me as my previous doctor had! I will stick with her as long as I can.   Quick and professional. Recommended highly.
72		I drive over the road all over the country I was kind of afraid to walk into a walk in clinic and I have to say the doctor who attended me over the phone on face chat did a marvellous job very nice to care of me on a very personal level which I felt comfortable and yes I would use their service again
101		This was the first time I'd ever try an online, virtual Dr. appt. You have a choice of doctors w/their bios, easy to choose appt slots and they take take insurance. I realize that not everything can be handled virtually, but this is a great alternative to going out during the pandemic. I had a UTI and the Dr quickly diagnosed it and sent the prescription to CVS. Totally an A++ experience.
115		I never received the results from the sed test that was ordered for me. I was asked to provide a full medical history to the MD treating me, which I spent a good amount of time creating and then emailed in, and never heard back a thing about it...and my last two appointments were completely missed by the MD with Plush care emailing me 30 minutes after the start inviting me to reschedule. Got the message...you don't have time for patients either, just like my MD IRL...
116		This was my third time using plushcare. The other two times were awesome I told all my friends. However I was placed on quarantine by Dr.Saja Magid. She never gave me any prescriptions to cure the problems, she sent me paperwork to get tested for Coronavirus. I gave them the same paperwork she gave after an hour and 30 minutes later I was told the paperwork wasn’t any good. They advised not to go to the emergency. I went back home quarantine 10 days. After that I was suppose to go back to work. I have an email stating I couldn’t go back to work until I take the coronavirus test. After I take the test at cvs by my house I asked her for a doctors notice she didn’t want to give it to me, for the same week she told me I couldn’t go back. After she fixed that issues several email later. Prudential needed her to fill out paperwork about my time off for I can get paid. She refused to fill it out. Now I’m stuck and can’t get paid until for 3 weeks.
120		"Due to Covid, I only had a """"virtual visit"""" with my primary care physician last Spring. After listening to my heart she would've done an EKG an found the afib, but she couldn't because it was well . .  a virtual visit. If not for the FitBit Heart Study, I wouldn't have known about my afib~!! I've had heart failure in the past, and recovered fully, but no history whatsoever of afib. FitBit sent me the heart monitor, which I wore for 10 days. I had a virtual visit with PlushCare's Dr. Jennifer Huldin where she informed me that I was in afib 100% of the time and advised me to call my cardiologist asap, which I did. He immediately put me on blood thinners. I am so very Thankful to the FitBit Heart Study and Plushcare's Dr. Huldin. If I'd waiting until covid was over to have an echocardiogram who knows, I might not have survived~! Thank You All So Much~!!"
128		I am 100 percent satisfied with PlushCare Vitural Healthcare. My first time using PluahCare was a world away from previous experiences elsewhere. It was good to be treated with professionalism and care. I cannot say enough good things about PlushCare and would choose them over any other medical professionals I've been to in the past. I am so happy with everything about them and recommend them to anyone needing to see a physician. I cannot say enough good things.  Love love love them.  Thank you so much.
131		I was having a really bad sinus headache and my own doctor would not see me because of covid so I needed a doctor appointment at the time NOW. So I found there link while searching for a new doctor and I was so relieved to be able to make a vitrual appointment and receive a pecription and be on the road to recovery within 2 hours.The virtual Doctor was very nice and caring thank you for this service.
154		I am very happy I found you.  I had Covid-19 and my doctor did not have tele visits Saturday and he was not going to any tele visits till Tuesday.  I don't know why but he was not there for me. I was very ill and doctor gave me the right medications, had I waited till Tuesday for my doctor I probably would not be alive now.  Thank you for everything you do.  Please keep up the good work helping people with COVID-19.  I have been referring my friends to you.
158		I love PlushCare.  The fact that I don't have to leave my home to go to a Doctors Office is very comforting and makes me feel safe during these trying times.  I have been seeing Dr. Allan Marks for any health concerns and prescriptions and he has answered all my questions with professionalism, has a listening ear and great bed side manner.  I highly recommend this virtual service.
171		I was suffering from a pinched nerve in my neck and was in lots of pain with a numb left arm when I called.  Dr. Nancy Rolnik was very helpful and kind. She was thorough in asking questions and was immediately comforting to know I have access to such a knowledgeable and thoughtful professional with the ease of a simple video call. I would absolutely recommend Plush care services and I believe  Dr. Nancy Rolnik is a stand out when it comes to being helpful and accurate. THANK YOU PLUSH CARE!  AND THANK YOU DR ROLNIK!
175		Hi my neurologist refused to fill my script she said get it from your provider I didn't have a provider I started to look for one and came across plushcare get your script in 15 min so I called and spoke to Dr Smith I was having very bad anxiety I was at my limit couldn't take one more day he saved me within a few hours I was feeling better I even told my kids how great plushcare is.
177		When I could not get in to see my primary doctor, and knew I did not want to go sit and wait at the ER or Urgent Care, I decided to give Plush Care a try.  I was overwhelmingly impressed.  Within 20 minutes of making an appt., I was online speaking with a physician.  He wanted me to go to lab and have test done.  I left immediately after our online visit.  When I arrived at the lab, my orders were already there.  When I went to pick up my meds, they had already been ordered and were being filled.
194		I was on vacation when I had an odd pain develop. Being out of my home state, I didn't know where to look. So I Googled nearby Urgent Cares & Plush Care popped up first. I was a bit apprehensive but I signed up. I am so glad I did. I got the first appointment of the morning. Dr.Vugt came on promptly on time and helped me. I am so grateful for this site. Made my remaining days on vacation bearable.
198		Great appointment. The appointment was on time and easy to do on my phone. Dr. Merino was friendly professional, knowledgeable and helpful. She took the time to listen and then easily diagnosed and prescribed for thrush. I just love that I did not have to leave my house for a simple medical problem that was easily remedied! Thank you so much!
201		I am in between doctors at this time and do not feel comfortable in any medical facility or public places during the covid outbreak. I was able to consult with Dr Reich on line and get the medicine I was needing.  My only drawback to this situation was that they could not accept my insurance? I would recommend Plushcare to anyone needing a Dr visit. 😁👍🏻
204		PlushCare is awesome!! I got a UTI in June and due to COVID I didn’t want to go to an urgent care so found PlushCare through googling. I signed up for the service at 4am (up due to said UTI) and made an appointment for 8:15am. The doctor dialed in right on time (Through video call) and asked a few questions to understand my situation, and by 8:20am he had sent a prescription to my nearest pharmacy, so I had antibiotics in hand at 9am. All without having to wait an urgent care and paying about 25% of what an urgent care visit would have cost. I got another UTI a few months later and scheduled an appointment with the same doctor, who reviewed my symptoms,  how my previous medication worked, etc. He again dialed in right on time and I had medication within 30 mins of the call.I highly recommend this service - it’s seamless, efficient, much cheaper than urgent care visits, and the doctors are caring and knowledgeable!
210		The doctors are knowledgeable and very capable in treating a persons ailments. They offer expert advice and treatment customized to your needs. The website is very easy to use and professional. PlushCare has concierge services. For example, helping you obtain a local doctor. A doctor who specializes in medicine relevant for your condition. PlushCare will always be there every step of the way. PlushCare  believes that everyone deserves a special attention.
216		In the past the most of doctors I have seen all seem to follow a routine of  confusio in my opinion.  he doctors that I have spoken with at PlushCare have been up to speed before I talked with them and asked a lot more in depth questions.  Very fast, top quality physcian, and good advise.  I will continue to use them.  Thank you.
226		Dear Plushcare,The services you rendered to me (consultation and rx) were excellent. In less than an hour from signing up, I received a thorough consultation and a prescription for antibiotics that was sent to my pharmacy and almost immediately available for pickup.I have endorsed you several times now. I will continue to use your service as necessary.May I ask that you stop asking me for my opinion? I have given you excellent reviews many many times now. Please stop. This is becoming annoying.Many thanks,Micaela
232		My experience with Plush Care was just outstanding. Within 5 minutes your amazing Doctor diagnosed my situation and had a script already called in to our local pharmacy within those 5 minutes. Between 24-48 hours later I was completely cured of my out of control UTI.I have told my family about this amazing service, and to be sure, if something such as this should happen to me again. Plush Care is where I will be heading. It saved me a 25 minute trip to the Doctor's Office and onto to our Hospital Lab during a time when I was already feeling so badly. I'm better YIPEE... Thank you so very much. What a great team of service you have and provided us all with. Blessings and Peace, Lucinda M Lickver
251		Whole visit took around 1 minute, it was really quick but I only wanted prescription which I HAVENT RECEIVED after. Doctor hasnt order any medication for me and it hasnt been changed during whole next day so ive asked for money refund. Im running out of pills and here i wasted 2 days of waiting, 10$ and my insurance will be charged. Scam... shame on you.
253		I will give this two stars because all doctors were nice to talk to.  However, since experiencing this online care, it seems like a fiverr for doctors.  You'll go through a list of them because you can never find the same one in the new rotation, at least I never did.  Further, after speaking with a few different doctors, you're always encouraged to contact them, text through the app, email them back after the appointment if you have questions.  None of them replied.   That's it for me. Canceled and demanded a refund.  I now realize it basically urgent care online until you get your own solid insurance. Healthcare is changing rapidly so there are so many options.
254		When signing up on PlushCare I thought their pricing was straightforward & w transparency. Unfortunately here is Another company that tries to get more then they should. When signing up - I paid their first $99 for the first appointment, understandable, then my (2) monthly $14.99 fee. BUT After 60 days they require another appointment of $69 to continue your script. What?Doesn’t seem fair or Koesher does it? If you’re getting an antidepressant script w plush For a year w all their fees is $700. Go see your local doctor. A hell a lot cheaper!
255		took my money, said that my problem was to much to deal with.  i asked for a referral to someone else and the response was. set another appointment.  so basically pay again. so 200.00 just for a denial and maybe a referral? i feel scammed . Now its been two days ive been hiking through a national forest. maybe another two until i reach a real Dr. 135 miles im hiking when all i needed was some antibiotics. I do not recomend you use this if you have anything more then a sunburn, or a refill on your pain meds. even thats iffy. good luck. dont die like me. just get to a real Dr first.  The receptionist was really nice though. she actually was concerned.
256		Absolute worst experience with tele-health. My insurance company uses PlushCare, but it took forever for PlushCare to apply my insurance. It was constant going back and forth between my insurance company and PlushCare. What was more frustrating was that they made me the middleman. In addition to my insurance issue, my doctor was a no show for TWO appointments. I know I could visit another physician, but it is still just a terrible experience if I want to see a specific physician again. But wait... I'm not done. My physician gave me a referral to see a specialist. I filled out the form after the appointment to complete the referral with the promise that the PlushCare team will be in touch to complete the referral. No one has been in touch, and it has been over 5 days (3 business days and 2 weekend days). Fortunately, my insurance allows me to visit a specialist without a referral, and I won't have to deal with PlushCare to complete the referral. The idea of PlushCare is great, but they dropped the ball so many times that I would never recommend this to friends and family.
257		Plushcare seems to be a waste of time and nonsense. I  inquired with Plushcare AFTER receiving an email from them regarding colorectal  cancer and Cologuard. Just by coincidence I had been trying to a get a prescription for Cologuard. When I looked and called regarding the background of their doctors , none was a gastroenterologist. Since they claimed to take various insurances, I asked if they took Medicare. They do not. Many people who develop colorectal cancer are older and possibly seniors and therefore use Medicare. In the time of Covid ,when it is difficult to get medical appointment, why are organizations like Plushcare wasting people's time with such junk
261		The website is outdated and could not find my physical address.  My address has been on google maps and similar apps for years.  They don't mention what time zone the appointment is in.  They don't say when their reps will be available to take a phone call and what time zone.  If they correct these issues they will get 5 stars from me.
266		Booked an appointment and The doctor had someone give me a call after they charged my card to tell me she couldn’t prescribe me antibiotics for an abcess on my chest that I let her know I have had come back for years and when I go to the hospital they ask if I want it drained or to try antibiotics yet she says she needed a physical exam. It was definitely a waste of my time I don’t understand what they could possibly do over the phone if she wouldn’t even take a look at the abcess or prescribe the antibiotics as if it’s addictive which IT IS NOT. Definitely don’t think this is the best or very legit.
268		"Gold Stars for physician quality based on my experience w 2 Plushcare MDs in 2019. But Red Flags for Plushcare's sneaky """"monthly membership"""" fee, $9, a 'membership' I never authorized, but they've been skimming from my bank acct since my second and last appointment, 12/2019. Not cool. Now cancelled (with confirming email, which is more than I got confirming 'membership).' No trust. Will change bank acct too. Hassle."
271		My doctor was excellent, but the payment system was horrific... borderline insurance fraud. The cost was advertised to be $20 with insurance (which I had) and $50 without. I was told after making my appointment, the cost would be $99. I was okay with that, but THEN my insurance was also billed $199 for the visit and then another $134 for the “health assessment survey” I was REQUIRED to fill out. Absolutely ridiculous.
273		I have some sort of urinary tract infection.  I was told to go in for a urine test, which is an additional $135.  The cost is fine, but the next day I was told I would need to wait 3-5 business days for the test results before I could receive any medication.  This is an unacceptable wait time.  On the positive side, everyone I spoke to was courteous.
274		My son was caught in a perfect storm right before Memorial Day....primary care Dr retired, extremely bad throat and sinus infection, Sunday before a holiday and a very poor “minuteclinic” experience....Thank god for plushcare.com prescribing an antibiotic to cure him!  We owe you as a family....I’d give you a 100 stars if I Could!  Sincerely,   Roger W Wendel   (Sugar Creek, MO)
278		I used Dr. Marks as my Teledoc when I thought that I had the Covid virus. He was reassuring, very knowledgeable, and gave me exact instructions on how to handle everything. I feel very reassured and calm after talking to him. I can’t recommend him and the service enough. I also called back a few months later and he helped me with continuing issues. I highly recommend Him and this service.
285		I ran out of my normal anxiety medicine and my therapist had not answered my phone calls or emails for the past few weeks. Panicking, I googled how to get a refill and CarePlush came up. Within an hour, I had an appointment, got my prescription filled, and my anxiety level dropped amazingly. This is a great service and I would highly recommend to anyone who needed their medicine filled.
287		"I've been using PlushCare for over a year and it had been wonderful, and the convenience and the doctor I usually see has been great.  I've never been charged a """"subscription fee"""" in that time until this month when I noticed $14.99 on my credit card.  I searched my spam and trash to make sure I didn't miss a notice of this new fee, and didn't find a single thing.  This is fraud to start charging a subscription to existing customers without notice!  Then I investigate, there is no way to cancel in the app and it took me quite a few minutes to figure out where it was on the website.  Your service has been great, but I'll probably be looking elsewhere now due to these shady practices."
288		They were absolutely a pleasure to work with. There were tech issues the first evening and so I had to re book for the next day. They didn’t charge my card for that first day, since there was a tech prob and they got the issue taken care of between 6:30 on a Saturday evening, and that morning at around 3 am when I booked another appt. I messaged the care team that Saturday night and by Sunday morning I heard back and everything was taken care of. The care team there was on top of their game and they were great!!  The doctor was absolutely nice! He listened to what was going on and what I needed. It was a great experience after the tech hiccup!  Will definitely be going back. And for the price, you can’t beat it. I didn’t have ins, so I also looked up prices on good rx and I called a local pharmacy that I knew had good prices, and I did this ahead of time so that I had the info for my pharmacy before speaking with the doc. Anyways, 2 thumbs up and 10 stars for greatness!!  Thanks again and I would recommend anyone to them!
289		"I have been reading these reviews, and I reserve my option to give them four or five stars, instead of three.  I do applaud them for giving people an opportunity to voice their reviews here about Plushcare.  I don't consider myself stupid, I have a college degree and a master's degree but somehow I  was led to believe that this was a.doctor's """"visit.""""  I stepped on a large staple, and it was embedded in my heel.  It was a Saturday night and I didn't want to go to the emergency room. We all know how that goes. I needed it removed. ( I explained all of that in the description/instructions) It was only after I paid the $99, did I see the Sunday a.m. appointment was a """"video"""" visit. Obviously, you can't remove a staple through a video visit.  Perhaps, my bad.  Well, I spent the rest of the night and early a.m. calling everywhere and sending emails everywhere to cancel this visit.  Finally, the next morning, I received an email from Plushcare, advising that I needed a person to person visit and that they were going to cancel the video visit and issue me a credit/refund. (To appear on my account within 10 days).  My complaints, are as follows:  Much of all of this was run through Algorithms, although understandably, all on off hours...Somehow, I believe I was DECEIVED into thinking this was going to be an in person visit and not a video visit. Why will it take 10 days for the credit to appear on my account?   The cancellation was made mere seconds after the charge.  (As people say money is very tight these days).  Also from reading all of these reviews I don't want to be charged $14.95, nor do I want to be a member at this time.  So, I hope that doesn't occur.  Plush Care certainly has a place in our business world, and no doubt is a great service for those people needing such a service.  But it didn't happen in my situation.  I will revisit this review upon a successful conclusion."
296		"Great service to start  (2 months ago) . I had a back injury and without Insurance needed to see a doctor. The doctor was great, and the appt quick . Issue resolved.However , one month later I was charged 14.99$. This is apparently their recurring fee once you sign up. I was unaware.No matter, the fee was charged and I called to cancel the service . I did not ask for a refund . I sat on hold for 30 minutes waiting to talk to someone . This is due to how they have set up their app and website (which don't allow you to cancel without calling ) it's a scheme to make it more difficult for customers to cancel the service. I'm sure one of their reps will respond and say """" the app currently doesn't allow you to cancel but you can do it on a desktop"""" . FALSE. I tried the app to no avail and tried the desktop only to be told that the system was unavailable to cancel at the time and I must call.So....anyway.... After my 30 minute wait I spoke to someone who assured me that the service would be cancelled . Add another 15 trying to cancel and I've spent 45 minutes trying to get something very simple accomplishedThe end .Just kidding. They charged me again this month .... After all that . So, I've sent an email and called my credit card to dispute he transaction. It's not about the 15$. It's about the lack of customer service and apparent disregard for my request to cancel . I signed no prolonged contract.I doubt any of that will make a difference , and I'll probably have to call and wait ...again.I figured the only control I have (without changing my credit card numbers) is to leave a review and show others how they've treated me.In the end this company does nothing but set up the appointment through the app. That part is great but apparently needs to be done by someone else . This should be a per appointment fee, not a recurring charge . I don't mind paying for the set up.I don't have your company on retainer and you've done nothing to help me at all.... The doctor did ."
299		i Rated a 4 due to there were appointment time slots that were listed but once you click on the time the time slot wasn’t available and I also feel the cost of the office visit was too expensive during a pandemic for an online appointment.  I also sent the attending HCP a follow up message there was no need for a follow up visit but I still received multiple messages from a different HCP regarding a follow up appointment.
302		Great assessment and initial service by the physician who ordered my test, but very disappointed to learn that they received my lab results from LabCorp at 7am on Friday morning and it's now 600pm on Monday and they still haven't delivered my results or answered my messages.  As a Quality Assurance RN, this is NOT acceptable!  They also send me multiple marketing emails (SPAM) daily, but can't deliver my results.  I think this company jumped on the telemedicine bandwagon and is trying to capitalize on the Covid-19 pandemic and I will make it my mission to have them thoroughly investigated and shut down!!!
313		This is truly a fake service and they just want your money. I got charged for $99 on my first visit even though I had insurance. I was suffering from possible Covid19 and my online visit took about 10 minutes! I am now being charged monthly payments and there is no way for me to cancel. They don't answer phones or emails, and their online website does not work. THIS IS TRULY A SCAM, PEOPLE!!! I have to call my bank and ask them to block them from taking my money. Shame on you for doing this in this hard time when America is not in a very good condition.
314		My experience with Plush Care was amazing. I was down to my last 5 days of medication and was dreading trying to see my pcp because she has been reluctant to refill my anxiety medication. I was able to get a same-day appointment with Dr. Cleary at 8:15pm, which was super convenient with my work schedule. The appointment was efficient and I felt like Dr. Cleary set me at ease about the process with Plush Care. As a skeptical person, I admit I wasn’t sure how quality the services would be as this was my first time using a telehealth provider. However, I must say Dr. Cleary was extremely knowledgeable and even expressed an interest in discussing my other medical conditions, which made me feel that my visit was not just about throwing medications at a problem, but rather reaching a consensus about a long term treatment plan. His approach was very comprehensive, addressing my medical history as a whole. In the end, I was able to get my medication refilled and I left the appointment feeling assured in the care I received and I can honestly say I look forward to following up in a few months.
315		My lung specialist wanted me to come to his office in the medical center of the hospital. Probably wanted his $500.00 fee at my Health Risk. I called Plushcare rep. very nice lady. 5 maybe 10 minutes later we were done and I had an appointment for 1:30 following day and the doc called on time very nice guy got my prescription for Symbicort  and I asked him if he could prescribe Mucinex so maybe insurance might cover it if a doc says I need it. The reviewers who gave a bad reviews are probably looking for looking for dope. I read their reviews and you can't get dope without seeing a doctor. One said this is a scam. That person doesn't have a clue. I had my prescriptions in 4 hours. 3 1/2 hours was the wait was the pharmacy.
316		Outstanding service for my first telehealth appointment. I'm a registered nurse in NYC, and my internist is occupied with his critically ill patients. Dr Panach was amazing, caring and thorough. Great to speak and see your doctor. She was on time, and took her time to ask and answer questions. Called in my prescription to my own pharmacy.  So convenient. Its important to understand to log into the app using your email and password. Then you can facetime the doctor you chose. Highly recommended!!!!
317		I posted a review this morning in regards to my appointment video being shut down multiple times while speaking with my doctor. (The physicians at Plushcare are really great!!) I received a reply to my review from a Plushcare team member who was very concerned and assured me that the issue was being attended to. I am very appreciative to her response and care in this matter. It is with gratitude that I am gladly editing my review. Thank you, Veronica, for caring for my health as well as others for whom this has impacted
318		At a time when America is in a very bad way theres nothing worst than SCAMS. Since our Hospitals are being over run with patients these kind of scams come out. PlushCare is a fake service. They want your $25.00 DONT DO IT! These are the kind of companies that fiend on ppls pains & desperation's.  There reviews are all most likely fake. Trust me what I'm saying I tried to use there service but they lied & cancelled it.   Stay with your family doctor any doctor you find on line like these people are surely FAKES!  Stay away they want your money, & sick  desperate people.. Stay far away!  God Bless Us All From Scams Like These degenerates.
319		STAY AWAY.  My grand daughter who is 2 was prescribed the wrong dosage of medicine 2 times.  The dosage was to high.  The first time she vomited multiple times  ∵ her parents thought it was correct.  Then my daughter called and spoke to another MD who said he was a pediatrician and he sent a script to the pharmacy for another antibiotic.  Since I’m a healthcare professional I reviewed it & the dosage was more than twice then what she was suppose to receive.  It could of killed her and caused her major health problems.  My daughter found the old prescription from her regular pediatrician which had the correct dosage on it.  This just confirmed how wrong this telehealth MD from this firm was.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Always check dosages before giving meds to your children.  They have to be calculated using their weight.
321		I was so disgusted with this service I would never recommend it to anyone. My daughter is a college student 3 hours from home and has been suffering panic attack and OCD issues. She has a counselor on the school staff but they cannot write a prescription. I called plushcare on a Sunday evening and sat on hold for 45 minutes, I then spoke with a representative and asked point-blank if my daughter scheduled an appointment will she be able to talk to a medical professional that could write her prescription for something like Prozac, I was told yes. She booked an appointment for 12:30 the next day and was really looking forward to it. She got a message 15 minutes beforehand that they cancelled her appointment?! I called and spoke with another representative and he just simply said the doctor reviewed her information and said she needed to see a physician in person?! I have a child on the verge of a nervous breakdown, she was really looking forward to speaking with professional and getting a prescription and they pulled the rug right out from underneath her.
322		This was my first time using the app & service. The rxperience was so wonderful. So easy, the doctor was very nice & understanding.  We were both experiencing  technically connection difficulties due to weatherIm sure he called me to finish the live chat. Called me in medicine. I will chevk back in about 3 wks to see how things are going and the price will be half of todays visit. I didnt have to take off work, called in for the appt on a sunday. I mademy appt sat for a sunday appt at my convenience. Overall I give Plushcare a 5. Id give a 10 but thats not an optiin. Thank you!!
323		Easiest appointment I've ever had and Dr. Marks was wonderful. He was kind, personable, and showed genuine concern for my well-being. I will use this service whenever possible. This was by far the easiest doctors visit from scheduling to picking up my prescription that I've ever had. Would recommend to anyone needing a doctor on short notice. It took 13 minutes out of my work day, rather than several hours - which helped to alleviate my stress. I had none of the issues waiting around that you usually do with a doctor's visit. Overall I'm thrilled with this website!
324		I am extremely pleased with the services PlushCare provides, and especially pleased with Dr. Tina Wu (Northern California) who I recently had an appointment with through PlushCare. I have never used any online health care service provider before and was unsure about how PlushCare worked or how complicated the process might be. I was extremely pleased with my entire experience and amazed at how quickly and easily I was able set an appointment to meet with Dr. Wu (within an hour of signing up) and get my prescriptions renewed immediately. I was very happy with how easy it was to complete the online information and to meet with a physician via video chat using my iPhone without driving anywhere or waiting to see a physician in person. I also appreciate Dr. Wu's undivided attention during our call, the excellent advice and feedback she gave me, and the fact that she answered all questions I had regarding a number of health related issues. I also greatly appreciate the fact that Dr. Wu was available to take a call from my pharmacy to approve a slight adjustment to my prescription because the pharmacy was out of one of the medications prescribed. I found the price to be very, very reasonable, especially for the level of medical service provided, and the cost to use PlushCare was actually far less than it would have cost me in time and fuel expenses to drive to an appointment and wait to see a doctor to achieve the same result. Based on my excellent experience with PlushCare, I would definitely recommend their services to anyone who is in need of medical care -- with or without healthcare insurance -- and would definitely recommend Dr. Wu for anyone seeking excellent medical care/advice in California.
325		I can't describe how awesome and convenient this service is for me. I had the pleasure of having Dr. Klenk as my physician, and her assistant. She helped me tremendously with getting enrolled on a medication program and was so thorough and showed honest concern for my health and well being, she's actually the best physician I have ever had.  Amazing app and amazing Dr, thank you so much!
330		Dr. David Dante was extremely helpful when it was a really stressful time with pneumonia. I had been in and out of the hospital, but needed some advice on whether I should go back to the ER or go to urgent care. This service is great! Perfect when I'm traveling and need a prescription refill or need to see a doctor.
334		Read the reply and you will know what I am talking about. I do not take controlled substances, however, Plushcare thinks otherwise. (Lol)If you are searching for an online doctor, avoid Plushcare at all costs, and sign up with Amwell. Amwell may charge $199 for the initial consultation, however, it goes down to $95 from the second visit, which makes it more economical than Plushcare in the long run. I was utterly disappointed and disgusted by the way Plushcare agents reacted to my questions. Plushcare lack accountability, professionalism, and courtesy. Plushcare may promise you the world, but fails to deliver what they have promised. Quality wise, Amwell is much more higher and when I got fed up with not getting anywhere with Plushcare, I immediately signed up with Amwell within just a few minutes, and got my consultation the same day. To be specific, Plushcare agents don't have time for you. I highly recommend Amwell, which is very helpful. Just no comparison to Plushcare.
335		This is a fantastic service! I am Canadian and was travelling to San Diego for a conference. I developed respiratory issues on the flight out due to the air conditioning system being stuck on full heat the entire journey. By the time I reached San Diego, I could hardly breath. I discovered Plushcare on a google search for medical care and made an online appointment. I received a response for the doctor on schedule. He reviewed my symptoms and my history of chronic respiratory issues. A prescription was sent to a pharmacy 2 blocks from my hotel. Within a couple of days, I was starting to feel great relief and by the time I returned to Canada, the issue was mostly resolved. I highly recommend Plushcare.
336		I am without insurance which is unknown territory for me. I woke up with pain in my eye, knowing the symptoms of a corneal ulcer. I considered going to an urgent care but found PlushCare when googling. I read the reviews and paid $99For an appointment with Dr. Stephanie Anderson. I used the app to connect to Dr. Anderson. She’s was kind, thorough and I felt like I was there right with family doc. In 10 minutes we addressed my eye and my regular prescription that needed a refill. She sent the scripts to the pharmacy that I pre-chose before the end of our appointment and my scripts were ready in 30 minutes at my local CVS/Target. I could not have been more appreciative and delighted by this experience. For sure would recommend and would use again.  **i received NO incentives for this review**
338		I'd give them 0 stars  if I could.... if you actually  need help and want to interact  with them, you are out of luck. I filled out a questionnaire  an d they cancelled  my appointment  without even speaking to me. I never got to even video chat with DR.  They might talk to you about a sinus  infection,  but if your really need anything  else, you'd be better of going somewhere  in person.
339		I have been recommending plush care to my coworkers. I really think  they are the best thing since slice bread, very convenient. It really turned around for me  when I  discovered that they really care and want to give the very best service possible. And if you are having any kind of issue with the service being provided and if they can do anything within their power they will help. This I know from first hand experience. It’s a win,win situation. I work in custusmer service my self so you can believe me when I say they rock.
349		I was disappointed by Dr Christina Garcia  brief chat.It lasted maybe forty seconds....She called late for my Three PM visit and her follow up inquiry was three day later.Apparently she has weekends off and was not available for a quick question regarding pain relief.I asked if I could take ibuprofen for pain but she got back to me three days later as mentioned and I thought this was unkind.Tylenol would have been an appropriate answer instead of ibuprofen which caused inflammation.She is a poor Doctor in my opinion and I would not and will not use your service again.I certainly did not get my money’s worth and her “bedside” manners are uncaring and I am not a fan of hers st all.Thanks but no thanks on Posh  Care and Dr Garcia.
364		The doctor actually listens to you. He is very well informed and excellent at making you feel at ease. The company is super accomodating, and get right on any requests that might arise ( i e prescriptions or test orders). My, many, experiences allow me to recommend the service to anyone without any reservations...I'm thrilled with the absolute professional care I have received from my doctor and the staff. A 10 out of 10 experience.
397		From the appointment making (which can be chosen day OR night) to the kindness of the doctors, staff,  the respect the doctors give, the professionalism, the accuracy of diagnoses with pictures & discussion, its just like being right in the doctors office but you're at home!!Communication is huge & these guys communicate! Dr. Clearly has been my doctor on PlushCare & I adore him to pieces! He is wonderful with me & very quick to ensure my antibiotics or pain reliever is available quickly. Keep up the awesome work!!!
400		Very good appointment. ONLY issue was that I was told by an admin that a certain med specifically could be prescribed, and then it could not due to state law, so I paid $100 NOT to get the medicine (after I checked PRIOR TO THE APPT). Very angering, but not the fault of the Dr. who was kind and tried his best to accommodate me.
407		My PlushCare experience was really impressive. I was very pleased with the doctor, and the overall experience. The only qualm I have is I would have preferred to chose which lab to have had my tests sent to. Apparently PlushCare has some kind of contract with Quest, who will not disclose the full cost of the test until after it is completed and you receive a “surprise” bill in the mail. As an uninsured person, I pay cash up front for my services. I prefer another lab in my city who will disclose the full test cost.
438		I was able to get in for an appointment right away. The doctor was polite, thorough and prompt with the appointment time, unlike waiting in doctors offices! It was so awesome to be able to not have to get out while I was sick and barely felt like sitting up. It’s like the old days where doctors came to your house and saw you from your bed! The prescription was called in promptly. The cost of the visit was very reasonable. I recommended the service to 2 other people who had the same flu, and they also loved the service. Will use it again and again.
446		I've used PlushCare for over a year and am completely satisfied with their service.  The 2 doctors that I've seen have both been professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I'm confined to a wheelchair and using the doctors on PlushCare is MUCH more convenient for me than actually going into a doctor's office for prescription refills and minor ailments.  I highly recommend them.PlushCare team.
459		Called with a low energy level and asked the doctor to test my levels. Went local had blood drawn etc... got results back that said I’m okay. Speaking with first doctor Was easy and I was happy that we were both on same page. After results came back I couldn’t schedule same doctor and all other doctors I tried to schedule with, said I’m okay so there’s no reason for another appointment? Still low energy levels and few hundred dollars gone all so I could get a blood test with no help for key issue. Low energy levels etc... don’t recommend unless you like being told no a lot. Good luck
461		"I don't trust Plushcare.  I paid $99 for a PEP consultation with Dr. Stephanie Anderson, which lasted all of 15 minutes.  I stated up front that I was paying out of pocket and not using insurance and the doctor confirmed it.  She didn't think I needed PEP and then the conversation gravitated towards getting me tested for PREP.  The doctor did not discuss the potential side affects or efficacy of PREP.  She told me to email her if I had any questions.  When I saw the lab order that she sent, I noticed that it would make me responsible for Quest Diagnostic's full rate and not the discounted rate that Plushcare has negotiated.  I tried to get back in touch with the doctor, but all of my emails were intercepted by people at Plushcare.  Every time I emailed, I got a different person, with a different story.  Ethan said the labs would be $105 and that they would send the correct lab order.  They didn't send it, so I emailed them again and Allison said I would be billed the full rate, because of the form.  When I lost trust in them and asked for a refund, they connected me with a """"Team Lead"""" named Janet, who said they could bill my credit card and send another lab form.  I got tired of the headache and gave up.  I don't even see any available appointments for Dr. Anderson in the near future anyway.  They don't offer encrypted emails, which is another thing the doctor failed to mention.  In the end, it was $99 down the drain and I still don't know if I'm okay or not."
465		Their office staff doesn't even understand how insurance claims work. They don't care to either. This place isn't worth the hassle. Don't use this provider unless you want to spend two months going back and forth about how they are in capable of filing an insurance claim.I used them three times. The first two times I had no real issues. The doctors are fine. The third time they suddenly forgot how to properly make an insurance claim. I would expect someone to make the effort get on the phone with the carrier and have them walk them through the correct procedure if they don't know how to do their job correctly. Nope, instead they just give up and say they don't know. Their solution is to shift the burden to me so they don't have to deal with it. I constantly have to follow up with them. They just don't make the effort.
479		Finally, a way to see a doctor for renewing prescriptions!  I dreaded going to see my family doctor because I was exposed to others who wereill.  The last 3 visits I ended becoming sick, even though I was perfectlyhealthy before I went, due to poor ventilation, stagnant air and patients who were sick in the waiting room area.   In addition, no more waiting days to see a physician or having to goto an emergent center, just to get a prescription renewed!  I love it!Plan on using this great service a lot.  Highly recommend it!
481		I went with plushcare because I was feeling a sore throat early in the morning. I had just started a new job and my medical benefits had yet to kick in. For $99 I love how I got to choose my doctor and also see who else was available.  It was easy to upload the photos of my throat, speak to the doctor and get my prescription antibiotics started. I highly recommend using plushcare.
486		Was on vacation and out of state, was looking for an urgent care and came across their website. Sounded too good to be true and I thought I'd run into some issue. Thought I'd give it a try and scheduled an appointment for 8am that day! Amazing!!! I didn't have to wait hours in a urgent care or anything! One call with the doctor and my prescription was called in!! No waiting or hidden fees! Absolutely the best
493		Both times I have used Plush Care the physicians were very prompt, thorough and kind. Both calls took no longer than 10 minutes. I love using this service as I don't have to deal with spending a full day at the doctor's office. At most, i run into the pharmacy and I'm done. Plus, it's the same price as my doctor's office but way less hassle. Great service...
497		I had just gotten off a plane and arrived at my hotel very ill with a sinus infection.  The nearest urgent care was 40 miles away.  I had never used a call in urgent care before but I would use you again in a second.  The service was prompt, helpful, professional and I received the needed medication to make the rest of my trip comfortable.  What a great concept !Good job.  Thank you for helping me.
500		"Moved to a New City almost overnight.No time to find a PCP. However I have to take 2 medications everyday. I only need annual check-ups in order to get a 1year supply of meds. While searching on-line for a General Practitioner. I found Plush Care. I was so impressed, (not a word i use lightly).I scheduled an appointment for the very next day. Dr. James, called me right on schedule.He asked me questions about my health.Some Questions, my previous doctor never asked. He explained why they were important. He was professional, courteous, very knowledgeable, (we spoke about various conditions). He was comforting, and caring.  Let's face it we do not always receive great """"bedside manner"""" by a physician.However Dr. James made me feel comfortable, While i was in my own home.I would, without a doubt recommend, PlushCare.Thank You Dr. James,Thanks to the Creators"
505		Last month when I could not get an appointment to see my regular doctor for days, I tried PlushCare. The experience couldn't have been better. From selecting my appointment time to the caring and knowledgeable doctor that I spoke with, I was impressed. I was able to gain piece of mind and be on the road to recovery much sooner with a PlushCare visit.The next day I couldn't wait to share my experience with friends and family.Thank you PlushCare!
513		I found Plushcare while googling urgent care centers for poison ivy and was absolutely blown away by their level of care!  I was able to get a same day appointment and the compassion and medical knowledge they exhibited were beyond impressive.  It was a better experience than any in person medical visit I have ever had.  Seriously! I have recommended them to everyone I know and will definite use them again.
518		My GP was unavailable for a few days and didn't want to sit at urgent care all evening in a room full of sick people. I made an appt to have the doctor call me at my convenience and found a pharmacy with late hours.  Doctor called me on time, looked at the photos I submitted. She asked relevant questions and I was done in about 20 mins.  Super easy!  The only thing preventing me from doing this all the time is the cost but I would definitely do it again and recommend this to my friends and family.
520		"I've had two contacts with Plushcare: the first was very good without any drama. The second was filled with drama & a lack of empathy...Dr. Mary even went as far as saying, """"We cannot keep filling your prescription without you seeing a Doctor...Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, but I believe that is the population Pulse is designed to serve, people with no insurance or needing a prescription filled bc they can't make it to their Doctor. Dr. MARY, also declared that she would only approve ONE MONTH (bc she's God on a dog) of my prescription medications. I stood firm, bc I knew the mandate or policy states that Pulse is allowed to grant three months supply of medication with each call. Dr. Mary seemed to be an angry woman, bc she lectured me about not having insurance...not accepting that I was recently divorced & my ex was providing my insurance & even after explaining that she was  inpatient, as if she was blaming me for calling Pulse. I felt like saying, excuse me for bothering U, your hiness!!! But I couldn't bc I needed my meds for high blood pressure...The good news: The Wizard of Pulse aka the CEO called after I noted my concern & I explained how inappropriate Dr. Mary was & he made everything ALRIGHT...THX PULSE...I'm very pleased with Pulse bc it is very convenient & the service saved me & lots of people a lot of money...even thinking about going to Mexico was horrifying...I'm glad I stumbled upon Pulse...thx for bridging my insurance gap...and the CEO informed me that Pulse is now accepting insurance...thx!!!"
523		I am without insurance and need to get my needed medications.  The Doctor that talked with me was professional and caring and was able to prescribe the medication I needed.  She even sent my a prescription discount card which helped tremendously with the cost of paying out of pocket.  I can even call in my future refills as I need them.
524		"I had an upper respiratory infection and knew I needed antibiotics after it persisted (as it was not the first time I had this). I had just moved and had no local doctor yet and could not wait weeks for an appointment so called Plush. A very nice physician examined me """"virtually"""" and called in a prescription and I was on my way to recovery in no time. She was very thorough and attentive. It was a very good experience when I needed immediate healthcare.  Thank you!"
530		PlushCare saved me at my best friend's wedding, when I woke up the day of the rehearsal with a terrible bug. The doctor called me quickly, was extremely responsive, and directed me to exactly what I needed to calm my symptoms. As I was enjoying the night on the dance floor after the ceremony, I thought about how grateful I was to PlushCare for saving such a special day in my life!
531		I have used PlushCare Urgent Care on three different occasions now and have received excellent care. All three occasions I was out of town. On vacation, at my Father's funeral and a wedding. These were stressful times being sick away from home. I was bound by time, location and access. The hotel first recommended PlushCare to me. PlushCare actually shows you the closest pharmacy. The doctors have all been professional, caring and thorough. I was able to make an appointment and speak to a doctor within an hour. This is an outstanding service and you should not hesitate to use their service.
533		"I was blown away by the convenience and professionalism of this service. 100% loved it and will use it whenever it is appropriate! Seriously, the best interaction I've had with the medical community in years. Both doctors called on time and were knowledgeable, kind and courteous. I got exactly what I needed. The entire experience was excellent! THANK YOU from a very busy working mom who has zero time to sit around in doctors offices waiting for an """"appointment"""" and the doctor is two hours behind schedule. THANK YOU!!!"
535		The medical consultation was efficient, friendly, and professional. The doctor asked a series of questions to do her diagnosis and prescribe the proper medication for my symptoms. Shortly after I finish with the doctor I received and email to let me know that if I needed anything further to please call.This is the second time I have used the service and would not hesitate to recommend PlushCare to anyone as stated above.
546		Awesome service, called right back, if there was a problem they fixed it immediately. Doctor was professional and to the point. Only problem was my state required a face to face and I was not told that so I had to reschedule- which they did for a few hours later that day. The picture connection would not work, so he called me and we continued because he had at least seen me. I told him what I needed and got the prescription in a hour.
547		As a mother of four I have appreciated this service and it's ability to save me time and give me the care I need. I suffer from severe seasonal allergies and I needed a prescription but my doctor could not see me for over a week. I called plush care and had an appointment with a doctor the same day and they called in my prescription for me. Within an hour I had the medication I needed and I was able to function again! The doctors were very thorough in their questioning me regarding my health. The cost is very affordable, the same as my out of pocket cost when I go to the doctor's office. I recommend them to everyone, I hope I never have to set foot in my doctor's office again, such a waste of time, exposure to so much illness and the offices charge an arm and a leg for cash paying customers like me.
551		Calling urgent care clinics locally to be seen and treated in a timely manner,without success.The over the counter eyedrops for a pink-eye infection gave some relief for the symptoms,the infection was not going away,only getting worse.PlushCare may well have saved me an expensive emergency room visit as well being able to treat it immediately.Loseing the prescrption anti-biotic eyedrops added to my misery.The follow up consultation and prescription replacement were as important to me as the original.The doctor was friendly,courteous and highly professional,I felt at ease and in capable hands. There are times when one may need an ambulance and emergency room,but this time PlushCare was exactly what was needed for me!
554		Was suffering from what was most likely bronchitis or waking pneumonia. Found PlushCare during an online search for local clinics. Doctor called on the dot, talked with me for fifteen minutes or so, I had a prescription for antibiotics at my local pharmacy within 40 minutes. Was feeling better within a couple days. Saved me finding a local doc, making an appointment, waiting for the appointment, getting dressed and going out, etc. I have already recommended PlushCare to friends and family.
556		Excellent service. Was a bit skeptical about using a MD through a website. I had just moved and did not have a primary care physician yet. Was about to go on a 12 hour deep sea fishing trip and needed an Rx for scopolamine patch. Picked my appointment time for call at home. Polite physician called on time. Asked a few questions about my history. Sent Rx directly to my pharmacy and had my meds within an hour. Would definitely use plush are again!
559		We were on vacation when I became ill. I looked up my symptoms on WebMD and was fairly certain what my problem was. I then started looking for an urgent care facility, which there was none!  I noticed an ad for Plushcare and it seemed like a no brainer to set up an appointment. I chose a time and a doctor called me on the time requested. After a short conversation he drew the same medical conclusion I had reach red. He asked what pharmacy I would like and said I would receive an email within a couple of minutes of our hanging up. 30 minutes later I went to the pharmacy and picked up my prescription. All this and I didn't have to wait 7 hours in an ER!  I would do this again in a flash!
560		I've used PlushCare twice in the last year. So easy to setup appt. online, the Dr. called at the exact time I requested, she was very friendly and easy to talk to. She sent a prescription immediately to my local pharmacy as we were talking. Everything done within 10 mins! and I never had to leave home when I felt awful! Love this service and will definitely use them next time I need a Doctor.
564		As a mom who has no free time we just moved to California I work 15 to 18 hours per day moving from out of state needed some regular medication refills to get me by until I get a permanent dr.The doctor was fabulous ask me every question in the book and prescribe me my refills without aggravation also turning out he knew I was sick over the phone prescribe an antibiotic hopefully I will feel better soon great job I wouldn't know what to do without your service
566		This service is for people who understand what's going on with their own bodies, because of numerous experiences. However, it is reassuring to have a doctor on call who will ask all the questions necessary to rule out something we have not considered. I appreciate this because I don't have to go to urgent care or sit in my doctor's office for long periods of time just to get a script I already know I need.
570		Plushcare is a great company.  So smart... it is such a hassle with or without kids to drive to the doctor, check in and wait forever just to see the doctor for 2 minutes.  With Plushcare you are given the option to video chat or talk or the phone with the doctor.  It's nice that you can lie in your bed looking or feeling like s%*! until you get the doctor call from the time slot you selected. If a prescription is needed they can call it in and you can be on your way to picking it up via a drive through. I also love that if you need to follow up down the road there is a grace period where you won't be charged.   It's a smart and savvy company that everyone will be using in no time. The fee is minimal compared to going into a doctors office. Convenient and affordable. I believe your insurance company can be billed too. Just give it a try next time you are feeling I under the weather, you will be glad you did.
579		This was by far the easiest experience I've had with any healthcare provider. Once I realized it was all done online! Made the appointment. Called the customer service with a couple questions, who were very friendly, set up the account and it was done. The doc called me at the scheduled time and we went from there. So easy! I've already reccomened to a few people!
581		I happened upon PlushCare, used it, and quickly became a fan. I was hesitant to give it a try at first because it sounded so easy and I wasn't sure it was legit.  I decided to go for it, and I am glad that I did. It is not always easy to see a doctor in person, especially on weekends. PlushCare has made it so easy. You set an appointment, the doctor calls you back, asks you a few questions, diagnoses the problem and writes a prescription.  It's as easy as that!  I have told others about this amazing practice and hope they will use it. I know that I'm going to continue using it.
584		I was so lucky to find PlushCare at a time when I was out of town and very ill. I did not know the area so was leery of a walk in clinic. Within an hour I was in the phone with a wonderful doctor who immediately sent my prescriptions to a local pharmacy which I picked up ten minutes later! Relief was at hand. I called back the next week at no charge to follow up and have my course of treatment extended. The level of care and concern was second to none and I have already begun to spread the word about your amazing service!
587		I was traveling for work, out of network, and sick on a weekend.  I was able to get a correct diagnosis and medicine in only a few hours.  The doctor was friendly and very willing to talk about the diagnosis and treatment options.  The cost was affordable (and especially so compared to my other options).  PlushCare was so convenient and pleasant.
588		I had a very positive experience with PlushCare Urgent Care.  I was traveling and needed immediate help with a Urinary Tract Infection.  I didn't have transportation to a clinic so I found PlushCare online.  The Dr. was professional and was able to call in a prescription to a pharmacy within walking distance of where I was.  It went to smoothly.  I was extremely pleased.
597		Did I get an accurate diagnosis and treatment?  Kind of hard to say as I got better but remained ill well after my antibiotics were complete but I was a pretty sick guy.  I did eventually fully recover after going into my regular physician and getting some steroids and an inhaler to speed up the healing process of the symptoms.  I have reservations about whether a video call allows an accurate diagnosis but I very much was not in a position to go into urgent care, which would have only allowed me a nurse practitioner, and my regular physician could not see me for a few days and in the same situation, I would try PlushCare again.  Everyone from the call-in person collecting my information to the MD who helped me was wonderful in their professionalism and prompt service.  Collecting my insurance information was easy as well as getting the appointment.  Definitely worth another try in the right situation.
603		I had had a UTI for a few days while we had been out of town for my mother-in-law's funeral.  I called my family doctor's office to see if I could get in the next day when I would be getting home but they were going to be closed.   I remembered Plush Care and decided to try it.   A Plush Care doctor phoned me in the morning at the appointed time, asked all the appropriate questions, and I picked up a prescription at my pharmacy just a little while later.
618		Had a uti went online was provided with several Drs. in my area and several online appts. for the one I chose.  Tried to have a visual meeting with him.  Didn't work but he called me in an hour or so and listened carefully to me and prescribed medicine to the pharmacy of my choice. Was very pleased. I had insurance so that really helped. Came back to the site later and noticed that I could have received a discount on my prescription but too late had already picked it up.  Would have been nice if I had been told from the beginning this was a perk.
625		I deal with the community on a daily basis. I have to tell you that with 20 years of working in the community. I have never dealt with such an efficient amazing doctors and it easy process to be seen for a toothache for an earache for a sinus infection for many different medical reasons. Also to do it by phone out  my home or on my computer for that convenience it's Irreplaceable you cannot ask for a better company or better service. Let's not mention my small co-payment.
634		This is a great service for minor illnesses that would otherwise require sitting in waiting rooms of urgent care or ER  facilities.  I have used them twice and both times I have been very satisfied.  While they do accept several insurances,  they don't yet accept Medicare.  I'm hoping that changes.   Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars for their superb service.
648		One Sunday, I called PlushCare about a headache that just wouldn't go away.  A doctor called me back about 30 minutes later.  I explained that the headache had started on Friday night, and still wasn't gone by Sunday morning. The doctor I spoke to asked me if it hurt to move my head or in bright light.  I said yes to both questions.  The doctor's diagnosis was migraine and he prescribed something that took care of it within an hour of me taking it.  I would highly recommend PlushCare!  Their service and knowledge are excellent!
649		Talk about convenience! Not only is this a moderately priced way to get help fast, the app is easy to use for anyone. The doctor was kind and helpful!! I was treated for strep within a day, and didn't have to be out of work too long because I caught this early and get the help I needed fast. If you're in any doubt, push it aside and give this a try, you will NOT be disappointed! and of course, feeling better in no time!
650		I work with kids and don't have time to not feel 100%, especially during the school year. Unfortunately, it happens more than I would like and normally, I have to schedule an appointment and hope that my doctor can see me after work. That is until I found PlushCare. My co-worker had used it and recommended it to me. At first I wasn't sure something so straight forward was even possible, but I was wrong. I downloaded the app, booked the next appointment during my lunch, and then had a prescription waiting for me at CVS. This is so simple and easy, I could not believe it.
652		I appreciate the excellent service PlushCare provides over the telephone, especially because I travel so much and am not always able to physically go into the doctors office.  Dr. Wantuck was thorough and pin pointed exactly what I needed to heal up from a recent illness.  It's comforting to know that if I'm ill whilst on the road for work in the future, I can call on PlushCare!
658		Had a very itchy a$$hole for over a week.  Did some googling and figured it was a$$ cancer or pin worms.  I didn't want to goto my local Dr. due to the nature of the simptoms.  I found Plush Care I was talking with a Dr. from Plush Care within a hour.  She recomened I change my diet to have more fiber.  After a week I was tottaly cured and didn't need any drugs.  I got saved me from a very embarassing visit to the ER room since my normal Dr. was booked for weeks.
660		During a recent business trip to San Fransisco I came down with a very serious ear infection. Without having any idea of local doctors offices a quick call to my friend brought me to Plush Care, and the service was fantastic! Within an hour I had an appointment and was speaking with a great doctor. Service couldn't have been better, will use in the future, great company!
661		I found PlushCare for a UAT in the wee hours.  I clicked for an appointment, and the physician called right on the minute (I could have web cam, but don't have a camera).  He took a good history, then sent a prescription to my pharmacy.  The entire thing took 11 minutes (about the time your regular physician will spend with you), without the driving and the waiting.  NOT ONLY THAT, he gave me a special number to call for immediate assistance if anything was untoward.  Highly recommend.
663		Plushcare saved me when I had strep throat.  I was new to town so I didn't know a good doctor off-hand.  As I was sick, I also wasn't in the mood to look up doctors and call around to a bunch of places and make appointments for who-knows-when.  I wanted to talk to a doctor quickly, and Plushcare came through perfectly after I stumbled upon it via a Google ad.  Within 30 minutes I was talking to Dr Mai Shiota, who was incredibly professional and attentive.  She wrote up a prescription, and 10 minutes later I picked up my antibiotics at the Walgreens downstairs.  The whole process from first landing on the Plushcare site to having antibiotics in my hands was less than an hour.  Plushcare is the way most simple medical issues should be dealt with.
664		This last weekend I was in New York for a close friends wedding and it was my first time to the city. On my fourth day there, my ear started to hurt, two days more and I couldn't handle it anymore.  Plus all the music and shrieking children didn't help at all. After searching urgent care on yelp I found PlushCare, their system seemed easy enough. I was able to make an appointment on my phone and get my prescription to cvs in about an hour. Im happy to say using PlushCare was well worth the effort.
665		After being sick in bed for days, not wanting to move -- I knew I should see a doctor, but nothing is worse than having to drag your exhausted body to the office. So, I did a quick search and found PlushCare. It was so convenient and I was diagnosed quickly so that I could start feeling better faster. The doctor was so considerate and each step of the way! 5-stars!!!
667		"I was sick with an acute bronchitis- but heavy like pneumonia. I have had asthma lifelong and the throat tickle started on Tuesday and by Thursday I had to abandon my camping trip- head home to recover.. My regular doctor would not let me """"slide in"""" (walk in) on Thursday and at 4pm the local urgent care had 20 patients ahead of me...and they close at 6pm. Looking on the computer for any local doctor...I came upon Plushcare??? Heck....Having no idea what to expect---called---had second thoughts---hung up.. They called me back hmm. The rest is good history...a quite thorough phone exam...a prescription sent into my local CVS... and it's Saturday and some very nasty stuff gone from my lungs and on recovery road. Dr Wantuck is on my """"rolodex"""" !  Thank You."
668		I am very happy and very much pleased with the PlushCare Urgent Care. Thank God there is this website available to speak a doctor asap that would prescribe medication asap. I highly recommend this to everybody. I already shared my experience with Plushcare to my friends and family and give it a try even if they have their own doctor already. This is perfect if you need a doctor right away especially when you can not reach your doctor yet or your personal doctor is on vacation. Please check the website.
670		Dr. Rudy was prompt to call at the appointment time. He listened to my needs and responded with care and concern. I liked that I got to rest at home and not have to wait in an urgent care with other sick people. It really took the stress level down. The pricing was reasonable and I will most assuredly will use this service again! Plush is the Uber of the healthcare world! Thanks again!
672		ALL I can say is that plushcare is amazing. I cant believe this hasn't been around longer it is in great need. I was treated by Dr. George Rudy for an awful infection. I don't have insurance right now and it was critical I got care. When my new insurance comes I am still going to use plushcare for these kinds of treatment. I have made a full and perfect recovery. He was so kind and helpful while taking as much time as I need to hear me out and treat with with excellent medical care. You can hear how smart and qualified he is while still being sensitive and kind. I didn't have to sit in an urgent care while being in extreme pain and discomfort and it was so quick and easy. The pharmacy was close and I am still so gratefuk for this service. Plushcare don't ever go away!!! Even the customer service that I called prior was extremely kind and helpful. FIVE STARS!!!
674		I am so glad that I finally decided to give PlushCare a try. In fact, after my consultation with Dr. Nuwer I told myself that I should have called earlier. I was fighting an awful cold that didn't seem to get any better. She took time to ask me in depth questions and gave me options. Very patient. I felt that this was better than going to a doctor's office where I usually feel rushed after waiting forever in the waiting area. I feel so much better after I followed her treatment. I have the option of calling her back in five days if I feel that I am not getting better. There is no doubt that I will use Plush Care again. It was so easy to schedule a time to talk to Dr. Nuwer. I definitely recommend this service to anyone.
675		I discovered PlushCare while traveling.  I needed a prescription but was in route to New York and found their website by chance.  After a phone consultation with one of the PlushCare doctors, I had a prescription waiting for me when I arrived.  I have used the service, and the same Doctor, several times.  Even here at home I just schedule an appointment and receive immediate response and satisfaction.  My schedule is very busy and not having to sit in a waiting room full of other ill patients makes this service even better!  This is a unique service which I intend on using again and again.  Thank you, PlushCare!!
676		Seriously can't say enough great things about PlushCare. I had called my regular doctor this past Friday morning about a problem I was having and spoke to her staff team. After describing the problem, I was told that the doctor would give me a call by the end of the day. I waited all day for the call, that I never got. Finally, when I was close to giving up on Saturday morning I found PlushCare. I called and spoke with Casey and he was extremely helpful in booking my appointment to get the help i needed. I talked with the doctor and was sent a prescription to my local CVS all before noon. I am so happy that I found PlushCare and that I was able to get my question answered and get the help I needed quickly. I don't know that I'll be going back to my regular doctor after having such a great experience with PlushCare.
677		A sore throat turned into a 103 degree fever on a Friday night and there were no nearby urgent care centers that were open. I was a little bit wary of a company that provides health care over the phone but I was in a bind. I called and made an appointment. An hour later I spoke with the Doctor who diagnosed me with strep throat and prescribed antibiotics. I picked them up that night and by morning had turned the corner.I'm not sure if this is the best service for everyone, but it worked great for me.
678		Due to heavy work commitments, I was unable to see my primary care physician or visit an urgent care after hours.  From start to finish,  PlushCare delivered on their website promises.  The sign up process is easy and I was able to schedule an appointment that began 15 min later.  Dr. Wantuck called precisely 4:45 pm and was very easy to talk to.  He asked all the appropriate questions about my illness, medical history and current medications.  I was able to ask all of my questions and get clear answers.  He called in my prescription to a local pharmacy immediately after the call and also promptly emailed me lab test orders.  They use SonoraQuest labs in AZ and it was easy to complete the required tests the next day.  I was able to view my results online via Sonora Quest and had one abnormal finding.  I called the 800 number and Patrick was very helpful.  Dr.  Wantuck called me back in 15 min.  He explained the result and answered all my questions.  There was no sense on my end that he was trying get off the phone and move on to the next patient.  If can't see your doctor promptly, are too sick to sit in urgent care, or you have scheduling problems like I did, PlushCare is your answer!  I will use this practice again without hesitation!
679		Yes. I'M rating this 5 stars. At first I was very skeptical about the service. I initially went online looking to schedule an appointment with walgreens take care clinic to address the ongoing issues with my shortness of breath, wheezing and nothing but ongoing coughing. All this caused by bronchospasms that I was previously diagnosis with last year of 2014 when I went to the ER for shortness of breath and wheezing. I was prescribed an  Albuterol inhaler as needed for wheezing and shortness of breath. Months went by and I finally took my last puff on my inhaler. So I dealt with this for quite some time without a prescription because I had no insurance due to being laid off. One night I could no longer take after doping myself up on 75mg a night of benadryl just to help deal with my allergies and my shortness of breath so i decided I would go to the take care clinic and that's when I came across plushcare, I did extensive research and looked on BBB and saw that they were legit and a had alot of good reviews. So I took a chance because for one it would be cheaper than paying $100 plus other fees to go to the take care clinic and not having to go to the ER for sure would save me a lot of money. NOTING that when I went to the ER last year for the shortness of breath I racked up $592 in medical bills just to receive a nebulizer treatment and steroids. But with plushcare I paid $69 for my appt and $58 for my inhaler with a $10 discount plushcare provides you with or without insurance. I'm from Chicago, IL so I had the pleasure of having James Wantuck, MD as my doctor. He called me at the specified time I had set up, ask me very detailed questions regarding medical history, medications and so forth, he was very kind and understanding and even told me what type of environment to avoid given my condition. What I also liked most was his willingness to make sure that the medication prescribed was going to be effective and if it didn't work to follow up with him so we can go to plan B. So yes I will be using this service moving foward. I told my family, friends and coworkers about this. Pls understand this is not a scam. Don't knock it unless you have tried and if u knock it well to bad for you, but I have my solution for not waiting for hours or even days to see a doctor and saving money. So thank you Plushcare and most of all Dr. Wantuck.
680		came across PlushCare while searching for urgent care options in Oak Harbor, Ohio. I was not necessarily looking for treatment during my call. Instead I was primarily calling to determine whether I needed immediate medical care for a set of symptoms that could have possibly related to a serious medical condition. I tried getting in to see several local doctors with no luck that day, so this seemed a convenient and viable alternative.The scheduling process was easy (though be aware that the time zones on the schedule may be for CA time and not your own) and I received a call promptly at my scheduled time. So far, so good.But what REALLY amazed me was the quality of the interaction between my doctor and me. He listened carefully and didn't rush me at all. He asked questions directly related to my specific concerns. Once I finished presenting my symptoms and concerns, he asked great questions. I've noticed often that doctors do not pick up on nuances or listen carefully and end up jumping to conclusions instead.After I finished sharing my symptoms, Dr. Wantuck summarized which of my symptoms concerned him and which did not. Since I was trying to evaluate how serious my symptoms were, this was extremely helpful. He was sensitive, compassionate, and I could tell that he was taking my situation seriously.Being candid, I will say that I had a high level of skepticism about the online doctor experience. I questioned the credentials of the doctors that would provide service this way, and didn't expect such a satisfying, professional experience. I have recommended PlushCare to many friends and family since my first experience and will certainly use the service again in the future.
681		"I was on vacation in the bay area when I recognized the early signs of a UTI (sorry if TMI). All I can say is THANK GOODNESS my cousin knew about PlushCare. I called, made an """"appointment,"""" explained my symptoms to the PC Doc and got my prescription, all in less than a couple of hours. It was a no-nonsense, easy-to-use system and it was perfect for someone traveling, or who just doesn't have time to mess with making an appointment for a week from now when it's too late."
682		"A friend recommended I try plush care before going to the visiting my local doctor for a sore throat/sinus/sore ear drums that wouldn't go away. I signed up online and booked my appointment and was speaking with a doctor an hour later via phone. The doctor was extremely professional and courteous. I explained my condition to her and she asked me a couple of questions. After our 10-15 min conversation she had diagnosed me with a ear infection. My prescription for antibiotics was available for pickup 30 minutes later. This was the most simple and REASONABLE """"doctors visit"""" I have ever had. I hope to not get sick anytime soon but if i do, I will definitely use Plushcare again and recommend it to everyone I know."
684		I have been fortunate to be able to use PlushCare a few times and have always had a great experience.Skipping the 30 minute drive to the doctors office just to find out they are running behind and having to wait an hour makes PlushCare well worth the affordable cost. I have been diagnosed and prescribed medicine without even leaving my house. I have recommended PlushCare to all my friends and family and highly recommend it to anyone else. You will not be disappointed!
686		I don't know you about you, but typically I find that I get sick over the weekends or when I am on vacation.  I was recently sick during a weekend and I had heard about Plus Care.  I thought, why not give this a try since I would have to pay a copay for an urgent care that would force me to leave my house. Anyway, I scheduled the call, I video chatted with the doctor and he called in a prescription for me.  This was all from the comfort of my home while I was in my PJ's.  Shortly after the call was completed, my husband went to the store to pick up my medicine and I got to stay at home, in bed, resting.  The doctor was understanding, efficient and provided me with the cold medicine I needed to get better.  Can't say enough about the great experience!!!!!!
689		I was nervous at first with this being a scam. At the time I didn't have a car so I couldn't drive to the Doctors. I gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised how fast it was to schedule a phone appointment (45 minutes). I was able to submit photos to help the doctor. They were able to give me a prescription and my husband picked it up on the way home. If your nervous about this service, let me reassure you they're REAL, they care and are able to help and give prescriptions. This will always be my first option in the future. And you cant beat the price!
690		I googled Urgent Care and Plushcare came up but I didn't understand completely what they did, so I called for an explanation. I couldn't believe how easy it was to speak to a doctor so I booked an appointment. It didn't take long at all speaking with the doctor and within an hour I picked up my prescription. What a great idea and service. I definitely will be using Plushcare again. Thanks!Casey
691		Saved me from the agonizingly long urgent care visit. Was under the weather, with cold and slight fever and Plush care came across my google search. Tried it for the first time and the experience was amazing. After talking to the doctor from my home, the prescription was filled and waiting for pickup at the nearby CVS. Can't imagine why i haven't tried this before. Definitely the future!!
692		Quick response, and great to be able to make an appointment instead of sitting in a virtual or real queue. Doctor called promptly at the scheduled time, asked detailed questions and understood the issue I was experiencing. I felt that I received the same, if not better, exam compared to a traditional urgent care center without having to drive across town, wait and end up paying more than the PlushCare fee. Obviously this service isn't going to help when you need stitches, but seems like a great option for any condition that can be described over the phone without need for a physical exam or intervention from the treating physician.
693		Here I am at home with a sick son and not feeling well.  I didn't know what I was going to do since I had a pretty good idea that my condition required antibiotics.  The last thing I wanted was to take my son to a walk in clinic and wait four hours to get a prescription.  I went online and searched for clinics nearby and came across the add for Plushcare.  At first I was skeptical, but when I read their website information it made perfect sense and was an answer to my dilema!  I made an appointment online and within a half hour I was on the phone explaining my symptoms to the doctor.  Within two hours I had my prescription and was able to relax and take care of my son.  Everybody is so busy these days and I can only speak for myself when I say that having an option like this is a HUGE help amd stress relief.  There have been times in the past that I have been in a similar situation and had gone a week before i was able to seek medical care.
694		I travel often on business and, unfortunately, am prone to sinus infections. I can't tell you the number of times I've been faced with severe sinus congestion and a mandatory business trip within the next couple of days. In the past it's been nearly impossible to see a doctor in time to address both my health and business needs, and I've been forced to travel with severe sinus or ear pain.  But now, PlushCare has developed the perfect solution.  Having top-quality healthcare available when an illness strikes is what we all need -  in my case, it's absolutely essential. Thank you PlushCare!
695		I highly recommend this company.  I wait an average of 2 weeks to get an apt with my doctor, or my kids pediatrician. Then I wait in a crowded waiting room for sometimes hours, just to see the doctor for 5 mins. My husband found Plushcare.com at 7:15 am, and I was talking to an actual doctor at 9:15am, the same day. They even called in a prescription for my sinus infection to my pharmacy. It was quick, convenient,  and extremely helpful. I have already told my friends and family about plushcare, and will continue to spread the word. I'm so glad my husband found this company!
696		My experience with PlushCare has been more than satisfactory. It's comfortable, because the doctors are all trained from top-tiered schools like UCSF and Stanford, and their professionalism clearly reflects it as well. The cost of ALL visits (they'll keep seeing you until you've solved whatever it is you called in for originally) was $45, which is so much cheaper than the actual copay of urgent care firms. And the people working at the company were super friendly in receiving feedback about my experience and how they could improve the process. Great company, great service—really excited to see it expand geographically!
698		I am a business traveler who lives in Florida and commutes to the Bay Area for work each week.  Yesterday I realized my allergies had turned into a sinus infection, and by last night I realized it was a BAD sinus infection.  I went online to search for Urgent Care locations close to my hotel, and PlushCare was an option that came up.  I clicked on the link, and intrigued, I decided to book an appointment for a telephone consultation.  I figured that if it was too good to be true--and I was convinced it would be--I could then leave to go find a bricks-and-mortar urgent care location.PlushCare DELIVERED on their claims.  The physician called me within two minutes of the appointed time, and I received a confirmation phone call shortly after booking the appointment.  Within 10 minutes of finishing my conversation with the physician, I checked my CVS mobile application and my prescriptions had been received and were being filled.$40 copay on my insurance for a visit to an Urgent Care with a lengthy wait, as opposed to a $49 fee for a phone call consultation in the location of my convenience and a speedy course of treatment?  Done.PlushCare has a very satisfied customer who will use them again if I have a problem they can help me with.
699		I was visiting Lake Tahoe and none of their urgent care centers are open on Sunday.  I knew I had a sinus infection stemming from a virus that would not go away. The doctor was very thorough in my diagnosis, making sure that his treatment would be the correct one.  After one day on the antibiotics I felt human again. I was able to start my recovery without having to wait until a weekday and did not even have to leave the house.
700		I am on a business trip across the country from home and woke up with a wicked UTI. I'm not familiar with the Coronado area and really didn't want to go to an urgent care or ER and contract something worse. I was hopeful when I found this company on a Google search but didn't believe this service could be true until Dr. Obrien called me on time. We talked for 12 minutes and he called in a prescription to begin my healing. He even called me later to see how I was doing. I'm so thankful and already feeling better. I would recommend this service to anyone. Thank you.
701		My daughter had a cough and wasn't feeling well and my ex-wife decided to drop it on me in a text. I called urgent care and they didn't have an appointment available until four days out.  When I goggled urgent care to find a different location I found PlusCare. I figured $10 bucks in gas, $15 deductible, 2-3 hour wait, hanging out with a bunch of sick people; or making dinner, helping with home work, and going about our evening as planned. It was a no brainer! My Daughter thought it was REALLY COOL !  Doctor Miller called us right on time. W H A T !   yes, right on time. We then went into a video chat and after several minutes Doctor Miller was able to decide what was the best remedy for the situation. My Daughter asked how long do you think it will be before you can x-ray, do blood pressure and temp over the CPU. I would think sooner then we think. This is the way of the future and I am glad we were able to use PlushCare, Thanks Google. Another great point to make is Dr. Miller spent more time we us then most doctors have in the past, We didn't feel rushed ! Thank You Dr. Miller ..
702		I had been sick for three days and wasn't getting better. I knew I needed antibiotics but the thought of getting out of bed and driving myself to the doctor was inconvenient. I googled urgent care and plush care came up. For $45 I have it a shot and I am glad I did. It saved me a lot of money and hassle. Highly recommend it. The doctor was knowledgable and knew right away that I had strep throat. :-)
703		"My daughter had tonsillitis.  I knew it was tonsillitis because of the temperature on the thermometer and the nasty white stuff on her tonsils.  I've seen it before.  I knew she needed antibiotics.  But to have to run out to urgent care with a sick kid...not good.  Plus, it's very expensive.I decided to look online for a """"new urgent care"""" for my sick daughter, and stumbled across PlushCare.  I thought it was too good to be true.  Handle the situation over the phone (or video chat if you like?).  $45?!!  If it worked, it would be the best thing ever.  I made an appointment, put in my daughter's info, and the doctor called right on time.  She was very cheerful and professional.  She spoke with my daughter for a few minutes and that was that.  She double-checked with me regarding allergies to medicines.  Within an hour I had antibiotics in my hand and could get my daughter on her way to recovery, without her ever having to leave her bed.  Thanks for this wonderful service!"
705		First off...I never write reviews...but I am today, I do, to sing the praises of Plush Care!!!   Soo nurses are infamous for going to work sick..I had a bad case of the flu, went back toooo work too early and developed symptoms of a uti.  I couldn't miss any more work and found PlushCare on line bout 50 minutes before my shift!!!!  I signed up, called and was able to get a phone appt with Dr George Rudy for 230pm.  I spoke to him on my way to work and he called in a script , with a coupon and I started on the med and my symptoms are gone and I'm feeling so much better!!!  Dr Rudy was very professional and immediately took care of my problem!!I would highly recommend this service to any of my colleagues..it is a quick and inexpensive way to be treat a known problem!!!  No waiting for an appt, or in urgent care for antibiotics.  I am beyond satisfied and am so grateful to Dr Rudy and the service that PlushCare offers!!!
708		"Dr. George Rudy was not only pleasant and efficient but also professional and courteous.  When it became obvious I had a bladder infection I was DREADING going to the doctor or urgent care....two hours of wasted time to pee in a cup and have the doctor then say, """"Yup...you have a urinary tract infection...""""  Dr. Rudy asked specific questions, was thorough in explaining  what I needed to do to deal with the discomfort and then called in my prescription to a pharmacy 1 block from where I lived....all from the comfort of my home!!!!!!  Great service, and I'll be using it again!!!!"
709		"WOW! What a great service! It;s obviously convenient & inexpensive, so the only wild card is effectiveness. For me it was EXTREMELY effective!Dr. George Rudy was extremely attentive, & quickly determined that my severe side pain was likely """"muscular-skeletal"""". (A relief, since some of the the possibilities I Googled were pretty scary.) He prescribed a muscle-relaxant & sleeping med, & gave me great advice. He even checked local pharmacies to find the best price! (I paid $11 at Target.)3 1/2 hours after my appointment I fell into blissful sleep. I awoke almost 13 hours later, feeling refreshed and with manageable pain. (My routine lately has been to knock myself out with sleeping pills and wake up 4 hours later, when the pain overcomes the drug.)At first I was disappointed that he can't prescribe strong pain-meds without a physical appt.. Now I'm convinced that the regime he advised is much better. It's a little more complicated than just popping a pill every few hours. Pain serves a purpose though. Now I have manageable pain that reminds me to take it easy & let my body heal, but still allows me to function reasonably... and SLEEP.Thank you, Plushcare, for providing a unique & valuable service. And thank you, Dr. Rudy!"
711		Hi:I just want to inform you that I had a WONDERFUL experience with Plushcare and Dr. Wantuck.  He spent more time with me than my regular primary care doctor.  I did not feel rushed and my prescription for the sinus infection was called in immediately to my pharmacy.  I get sinus infections every spring and Plushcare will be my new medical service for this condition.  Thank you so much for starting this company.  You are awsome and I will spread the word!!
713		Wow! I happened to see PlushCard on a search for urgent care in my area. I had already called an urgent care in my area where I spoke to an obviously overwrought and stressed employee who was rude to me on the phone. I was ready to drive 30 minutes to a minute clinic at CVS to avoid a 2 hour wait while being surrounded by others who were just as sick as me. I was pleasantly surprised by the easy and straight forward treatment by the employees and doctor at PlushCare. Within one hour of contacting them, I had a consultation, diagnosis and prescription called into a pharmacy near me for $45. The doctor also gave me instructions for home care which were very helpful. As a healthcare professional, I appreciate the fantastic professionalism accompanied with just good old fashioned care and compassion. PlushCare you got it right! Thank you and I will be referring the people I love to you as well!
715		The Dr. I communicated with was very attentive and was more then willing to help. The process was fast and had my result instantly. The doctor demonstrated great people skills and showed vast medical knowledge. I would recommend the service to anyone. I live a very busy life and do not get sick often so when I do it was nice to not have to schedule and appointment and wait to be seen. Excellent service.
716		I recently traveled to California for a vacation and decided to drive to Napa Valley to see the scenic views.  While driving the countryside with friends, I became extremely nauseous.  After being unable to find a doctor in the Napa area that would see me on such short notice, I utilized Plushcare at the suggestion of a friend. And, I am SO glad I did.  Within minutes, I was speaking to a knowledgeable and professional doctor about my nausea and vomiting in the privacy of my hotel room. After a thorough discussion, the doctor prescribed me medication to a drug store down the road that truly saved my weekend vacation.  I would recommend Plushcare to everyone and wish there was a similar alternative available in Pennsylvania.  California residents are truly lucky to have Plushcare.
718		Great experience! I'm new to Plush Care. A friend passed along info about their recent Indiegogo campaign and I contributed, which got me a membership. I used it the other day for the first time and was not disappointed -- in fact, I was impressed! I usually get a sinus infection at least once a year and have to take an annoying trip to the doctor's office just to get a prescription for something I already know I have. I decided to give Plush Care a shot and it was way more convenient. In the end, I got the prescription I needed without the hassle. Looking forward to more visits.
725		PlushCare's service symbolizes the blend of modern technology and medicine. Many working professionals such as myself have little time to go to a doctor's appointment, let alone wait for a consultation. PlushCare is efficient, and I can consult a top-notch doctor at a time that works for me without the need to wait. The service is affordable, efficient, and secure. You can't ask for anything more - highly recommend this to everyone!
729		I am constantly on the road for work, and happened to be on the east coast (In the middle of nowhere) a while back when I came down with a sinus infection and needed antibiotics. I was complaining to a friend about the inconvenience of searching for a doctor. She tipped me onto Plushcare, and there i was able to make a same day online appointment with a reputable doctor. i received my prescription and was back and ready to go. I highly recommend  using Plushcare anytime, anywhere.
732		Instead of packing up the kids and heading down to the Doctors office and waiting around for an hour, I just made a simple phone call and talked to the nicest Doctor. After hearing my symptoms, the Doctor was able to diagnose me quickly and send a prescription to a pharmacy nearest my home. Such a time and money saver. Great experience!
734		I heard about Plushcare through friends and decided to give it a try.  With a demanding work schedule and little time to myself, I found it extremely helpful and reassuring to know I can contact a doctor without having to set apart time not only for the appointment but travel time to and from the office as well.  Not only is it convenient but the interaction with the physicians is professional and is an overall great experience.
735		Wow! what an awesome company.  I have had sinus infections in the past and know exaclty what I need for them.  AN ANTIBIOTIC! It's always a pain to get them since my doctor won't provide me a script unless I make an appointment, pay co-pay and come see him face to face which is totally unnecessary and annoying.  Thank you PLUSHCARE for making this simple.
736		A friend passed along this new service to me, and I'm happy I found out about it. I usually get a sinus infection at least once a year and have to take an annoying trip to the doctor's office just to get a prescription for something I already know I have. I decided to give Plush Care a shot and it was way more convenient. In the end, I got the prescription I needed without the hassle. Really happy I didn't have to waste my time standing around the doctor's office.
737		This is a great service to deal with those minor and unexpected health issues that arise. The time it takes to get an appointment with my primary physician seems like it's getting longer and longer these days. Sometimes you just need antibiotics for a very rudimentary issue and it can be such a nightmare of a process trying to get treatment. Plushcare can save you time, money and a headache. I would definitely recommend trying it out. There's nothing to lose because they offer your money back if you're not satisfied, which is pretty cool.
738		I am swamped at work and I have no time to go to the doctors.  I had this nasty cold for over a week and I knew it was a sinus infection.   My friend told me about Plushcare and I signed up a couple months ago thinking this would suit my lifestyle perfectly.  It was the best investment ever!!!!!  I called and the doctor called back in no time.  I described my symptons, and I get sinus infections frequently.   The next thing I knew, I was driving down the street to Rite Aid to pick up my perscription.   I did not have to miss any work and I was better before the weekend.   Everyone I talked at Plushcare was so helpful and professional.  They made me feel like they were there for me. You got to do this!
740		A friend had recommended that I sign up for Plush Care. I called to make an appointment and got a representative that provided a high level of customer service. The representative was very professional and answered all my questions quickly and professionally. I made my appointment and it went great. I loved how easy it was. Great Company & Concept! I will recommend to all my friends and colleagues.
741		I am a Consultant who is constantly on the road for work. When I came down with the flu and was across the country, I needed access to a doctor quickly. Although I generally rely on reviews from family and friends to pick a healthcare professional, I was far from home and needed a service I could trust to get me into the right hands. Enter Plushcare! I was able to make an appointment online and speak to a reputable doctor the next morning. I will certainly be recommending Plushcare to my coworkers who are more often away from home than in close proximity to a family physician.
742		I heard about Plush Care thru their Indiegogo campaign. I contributed and received a membership. I used Plush Care for the first time when I experienced a leg cramp while jogging. I spoke to a Plush Care doctor who was very personable and well informed. The doctor gave me a prescription for an anti-inflammatory, which I had filled at CVS. The entire process was easy and hassle free.
744		I found out about PlushCare when doing a Google search for a nearby urgent care. I at first thought there was no way they could make seeing the doctor this easy and it had to be a scam. However, I gave it a try because the team had extremely reputable backgrounds from places like Stanford and UCSF. It wasn't a scam and it was just as easy as they said it would be.

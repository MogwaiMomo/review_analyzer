1		Deceptive practice by signing you up for a monthly service
3		I joined my appointment and waited almost an hour and no doctor showed up. I called the number on their site and after about 6 minutes someone picked up. They informed me the doctor that was supposed to see me had a power outage, but no one got in touch with me about this. Canceled my membership right away and won't be using again.
4		Terrible customer service waiting 2 days for Dr to get back to me to change a prescription Incompetent and unprofessional
6		I saw that this had great reviews and figured that I would give it a go. Unfortunately I did not have a pleasent experience. I waited for over half an hour for my doctor to show up to the appointment and he never did. I called the phone number on the website as it told me to, and no one ever answered. I had to leave a voicemail. Overall I am very dissatisfied with this service and will not be using it again. Am going to be trying out a different site, ZocDoc, which doesn't need a membership to have an appointment. Hoping to have more luck there. I have no idea why this plushcare has so many great reviews.
20		SCAM -  I have been signed up for their “membership” twice.  A total of $30, and i never approved either time.  The doctors cancel right before the appointment saying they can’t help with that and reschedule you with another doctor.  THIS IS A SCAM
91		The first Dr. was an awesome experience. But when second Dr. did not do what he said. I called hotline and was treated so horrible even got hung up on.
103		The experience with the website and doctor was great.  A month later a received a charge for a monthly subscription fee, which I did not sign up for.
115		Tried to sign up to get blood pressure meds but they can't find my insurance but for 100 dollars they will hook me up in 15 minutes I already wasted 4 times that 15 minutes  and they still cant or don't want to because they prefer cash I would have given them minus five rating but it was not available
116		I never received the results from the sed test that was ordered for me. I was asked to provide a full medical history to the MD treating me, which I spent a good amount of time creating and then emailed in, and never heard back a thing about it...and my last two appointments were completely missed by the MD with Plush care emailing me 30 minutes after the start inviting me to reschedule. Got the message...you don't have time for patients either, just like my MD IRL...
117		This was my third time using plushcare. The other two times were awesome I told all my friends. However I was placed on quarantine by Dr.Saja Magid. She never gave me any prescriptions to cure the problems, she sent me paperwork to get tested for Coronavirus. I gave them the same paperwork she gave after an hour and 30 minutes later I was told the paperwork wasn’t any good. They advised not to go to the emergency. I went back home quarantine 10 days. After that I was suppose to go back to work. I have an email stating I couldn’t go back to work until I take the coronavirus test. After I take the test at cvs by my house I asked her for a doctors notice she didn’t want to give it to me, for the same week she told me I couldn’t go back. After she fixed that issues several email later. Prudential needed her to fill out paperwork about my time off for I can get paid. She refused to fill it out. Now I’m stuck and can’t get paid until for 3 weeks.
134		Wrong diagnoses. Turns out tooth causing synose infection.
167		It’s BS you won’t let me cancel through the app. It resulted in me being charged $14.99 for no reason. I will not be back. It’s clear it’s an intentional ploy to reap additional months charges from your customers.
171		I signed up for their service today and scheduled an appointment for 1PM MST with Dr. Austin Smith. I signed on at 12:55PM MST, signed off at 1:28PM MST. Doctor did not join the call at any point in time.
252		Whole visit took around 1 minute, it was really quick but I only wanted prescription which I HAVENT RECEIVED after. Doctor hasnt order any medication for me and it hasnt been changed during whole next day so ive asked for money refund. Im running out of pills and here i wasted 2 days of waiting, 10$ and my insurance will be charged. Scam... shame on you.
255		When signing up on PlushCare I thought their pricing was straightforward & w transparency. Unfortunately here is Another company that tries to get more then they should. When signing up - I paid their first $99 for the first appointment, understandable, then my (2) monthly $14.99 fee. BUT After 60 days they require another appointment of $69 to continue your script. What?Doesn’t seem fair or Koesher does it? If you’re getting an antidepressant script w plush For a year w all their fees is $700. Go see your local doctor. A hell a lot cheaper!
257		Absolute worst experience with tele-health. My insurance company uses PlushCare, but it took forever for PlushCare to apply my insurance. It was constant going back and forth between my insurance company and PlushCare. What was more frustrating was that they made me the middleman. In addition to my insurance issue, my doctor was a no show for TWO appointments. I know I could visit another physician, but it is still just a terrible experience if I want to see a specific physician again. But wait... I'm not done. My physician gave me a referral to see a specialist. I filled out the form after the appointment to complete the referral with the promise that the PlushCare team will be in touch to complete the referral. No one has been in touch, and it has been over 5 days (3 business days and 2 weekend days). Fortunately, my insurance allows me to visit a specialist without a referral, and I won't have to deal with PlushCare to complete the referral. The idea of PlushCare is great, but they dropped the ball so many times that I would never recommend this to friends and family.
258		Plushcare seems to be a waste of time and nonsense. I  inquired with Plushcare AFTER receiving an email from them regarding colorectal  cancer and Cologuard. Just by coincidence I had been trying to a get a prescription for Cologuard. When I looked and called regarding the background of their doctors , none was a gastroenterologist. Since they claimed to take various insurances, I asked if they took Medicare. They do not. Many people who develop colorectal cancer are older and possibly seniors and therefore use Medicare. In the time of Covid ,when it is difficult to get medical appointment, why are organizations like Plushcare wasting people's time with such junk
260		The dr told me to go to urgent care but i got a bill of 200usd .....
261		Waited for 30 minutes and doctor never showed up.
262		The website is outdated and could not find my physical address.  My address has been on google maps and similar apps for years.  They don't mention what time zone the appointment is in.  They don't say when their reps will be available to take a phone call and what time zone.  If they correct these issues they will get 5 stars from me.
264		Biggest scam of 2020 and that says a lot. Charges way more than copay every time and never even got my prescription.
267		Booked an appointment and The doctor had someone give me a call after they charged my card to tell me she couldn’t prescribe me antibiotics for an abcess on my chest that I let her know I have had come back for years and when I go to the hospital they ask if I want it drained or to try antibiotics yet she says she needed a physical exam. It was definitely a waste of my time I don’t understand what they could possibly do over the phone if she wouldn’t even take a look at the abcess or prescribe the antibiotics as if it’s addictive which IT IS NOT. Definitely don’t think this is the best or very legit.
268		Spoke with a physician and was charged a fee for nothing! Got no prescription and now I still have no way to care for the issue at hand. Not like money isn't tight already! No thanks. Will not be using you ever again nor will I reccomend you.
270		Crooks - had to pay upfront $99 to refill a prescription that cost $1.47. My insurance payed them later and they kept that too.  The next month there was a 15.99 charge on my credit card. Cancelled card - the last dollar they are going to steal from me.
272		My doctor was excellent, but the payment system was horrific... borderline insurance fraud. The cost was advertised to be $20 with insurance (which I had) and $50 without. I was told after making my appointment, the cost would be $99. I was okay with that, but THEN my insurance was also billed $199 for the visit and then another $134 for the “health assessment survey” I was REQUIRED to fill out. Absolutely ridiculous.
274		I have some sort of urinary tract infection.  I was told to go in for a urine test, which is an additional $135.  The cost is fine, but the next day I was told I would need to wait 3-5 business days for the test results before I could receive any medication.  This is an unacceptable wait time.  On the positive side, everyone I spoke to was courteous.
281		Sorry for the 2 star but I relied on you guys to get me a doctor for a MRI and you faild.i need to be treated but it seems like you guys have a non chanlonat attitude.  I looked elsewhere. The doctor was good the follow up never happened.
287		Id give 0 stars if possible. They claim new prescriptions but will not do so. Multiple harassing phone calls. Blocked number and they'd call from a different one.
291		I was billed twice in the amount of $14.99 for telemedicine services I never ordered. The first fraudulent charge was refunded in April and a second fraudulent charge was billed on May 15,2020. A complaint has been filed with the California Attorney General!
292		Paid for membership, booked and paid for appointment, doctor never showed! But they sure took payment from my account. Praying I can get my money back so I can find another doctor.
297		"Great service to start  (2 months ago) . I had a back injury and without Insurance needed to see a doctor. The doctor was great, and the appt quick . Issue resolved.However , one month later I was charged 14.99$. This is apparently their recurring fee once you sign up. I was unaware.No matter, the fee was charged and I called to cancel the service . I did not ask for a refund . I sat on hold for 30 minutes waiting to talk to someone . This is due to how they have set up their app and website (which don't allow you to cancel without calling ) it's a scheme to make it more difficult for customers to cancel the service. I'm sure one of their reps will respond and say """" the app currently doesn't allow you to cancel but you can do it on a desktop"""" . FALSE. I tried the app to no avail and tried the desktop only to be told that the system was unavailable to cancel at the time and I must call.So....anyway.... After my 30 minute wait I spoke to someone who assured me that the service would be cancelled . Add another 15 trying to cancel and I've spent 45 minutes trying to get something very simple accomplishedThe end .Just kidding. They charged me again this month .... After all that . So, I've sent an email and called my credit card to dispute he transaction. It's not about the 15$. It's about the lack of customer service and apparent disregard for my request to cancel . I signed no prolonged contract.I doubt any of that will make a difference , and I'll probably have to call and wait ...again.I figured the only control I have (without changing my credit card numbers) is to leave a review and show others how they've treated me.In the end this company does nothing but set up the appointment through the app. That part is great but apparently needs to be done by someone else . This should be a per appointment fee, not a recurring charge . I don't mind paying for the set up.I don't have your company on retainer and you've done nothing to help me at all.... The doctor did ."
303		Great assessment and initial service by the physician who ordered my test, but very disappointed to learn that they received my lab results from LabCorp at 7am on Friday morning and it's now 600pm on Monday and they still haven't delivered my results or answered my messages.  As a Quality Assurance RN, this is NOT acceptable!  They also send me multiple marketing emails (SPAM) daily, but can't deliver my results.  I think this company jumped on the telemedicine bandwagon and is trying to capitalize on the Covid-19 pandemic and I will make it my mission to have them thoroughly investigated and shut down!!!
314		This is truly a fake service and they just want your money. I got charged for $99 on my first visit even though I had insurance. I was suffering from possible Covid19 and my online visit took about 10 minutes! I am now being charged monthly payments and there is no way for me to cancel. They don't answer phones or emails, and their online website does not work. THIS IS TRULY A SCAM, PEOPLE!!! I have to call my bank and ask them to block them from taking my money. Shame on you for doing this in this hard time when America is not in a very good condition.
319		At a time when America is in a very bad way theres nothing worst than SCAMS. Since our Hospitals are being over run with patients these kind of scams come out. PlushCare is a fake service. They want your $25.00 DONT DO IT! These are the kind of companies that fiend on ppls pains & desperation's.  There reviews are all most likely fake. Trust me what I'm saying I tried to use there service but they lied & cancelled it.   Stay with your family doctor any doctor you find on line like these people are surely FAKES!  Stay away they want your money, & sick  desperate people.. Stay far away!  God Bless Us All From Scams Like These degenerates.
320		STAY AWAY.  My grand daughter who is 2 was prescribed the wrong dosage of medicine 2 times.  The dosage was to high.  The first time she vomited multiple times  ∵ her parents thought it was correct.  Then my daughter called and spoke to another MD who said he was a pediatrician and he sent a script to the pharmacy for another antibiotic.  Since I’m a healthcare professional I reviewed it & the dosage was more than twice then what she was suppose to receive.  It could of killed her and caused her major health problems.  My daughter found the old prescription from her regular pediatrician which had the correct dosage on it.  This just confirmed how wrong this telehealth MD from this firm was.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Always check dosages before giving meds to your children.  They have to be calculated using their weight.
321		Stay away. Had a consultation and was approved for a Cologuard test kit. Spent four weeks faxing paperwork and e-mails to the company with no results. Very disappointed with this company. They seemed legitimate.
322		I was so disgusted with this service I would never recommend it to anyone. My daughter is a college student 3 hours from home and has been suffering panic attack and OCD issues. She has a counselor on the school staff but they cannot write a prescription. I called plushcare on a Sunday evening and sat on hold for 45 minutes, I then spoke with a representative and asked point-blank if my daughter scheduled an appointment will she be able to talk to a medical professional that could write her prescription for something like Prozac, I was told yes. She booked an appointment for 12:30 the next day and was really looking forward to it. She got a message 15 minutes beforehand that they cancelled her appointment?! I called and spoke with another representative and he just simply said the doctor reviewed her information and said she needed to see a physician in person?! I have a child on the verge of a nervous breakdown, she was really looking forward to speaking with professional and getting a prescription and they pulled the rug right out from underneath her.
333		talked to Allison Lovell 3p could not be more disappointed notonly rude but did not do anything last time time i ever will usethis BS service
335		Read the reply and you will know what I am talking about. I do not take controlled substances, however, Plushcare thinks otherwise. (Lol)If you are searching for an online doctor, avoid Plushcare at all costs, and sign up with Amwell. Amwell may charge $199 for the initial consultation, however, it goes down to $95 from the second visit, which makes it more economical than Plushcare in the long run. I was utterly disappointed and disgusted by the way Plushcare agents reacted to my questions. Plushcare lack accountability, professionalism, and courtesy. Plushcare may promise you the world, but fails to deliver what they have promised. Quality wise, Amwell is much more higher and when I got fed up with not getting anywhere with Plushcare, I immediately signed up with Amwell within just a few minutes, and got my consultation the same day. To be specific, Plushcare agents don't have time for you. I highly recommend Amwell, which is very helpful. Just no comparison to Plushcare.
339		I'd give them 0 stars  if I could.... if you actually  need help and want to interact  with them, you are out of luck. I filled out a questionnaire  an d they cancelled  my appointment  without even speaking to me. I never got to even video chat with DR.  They might talk to you about a sinus  infection,  but if your really need anything  else, you'd be better of going somewhere  in person.
417		Great service.. Got an appointment within 1 hour and started when promised. Got my meds quickly without having to wait 2 hours at my primary care Dr.
418		Ordered lab test in excess of what my PPO covered. I have good insurance so this came as a surprise when I received EOB stating test not covered due to them not being necessary for what was being tested for.
460		Called with a low energy level and asked the doctor to test my levels. Went local had blood drawn etc... got results back that said I’m okay. Speaking with first doctor Was easy and I was happy that we were both on same page. After results came back I couldn’t schedule same doctor and all other doctors I tried to schedule with, said I’m okay so there’s no reason for another appointment? Still low energy levels and few hundred dollars gone all so I could get a blood test with no help for key issue. Low energy levels etc... don’t recommend unless you like being told no a lot. Good luck
462		"I don't trust Plushcare.  I paid $99 for a PEP consultation with Dr. Stephanie Anderson, which lasted all of 15 minutes.  I stated up front that I was paying out of pocket and not using insurance and the doctor confirmed it.  She didn't think I needed PEP and then the conversation gravitated towards getting me tested for PREP.  The doctor did not discuss the potential side affects or efficacy of PREP.  She told me to email her if I had any questions.  When I saw the lab order that she sent, I noticed that it would make me responsible for Quest Diagnostic's full rate and not the discounted rate that Plushcare has negotiated.  I tried to get back in touch with the doctor, but all of my emails were intercepted by people at Plushcare.  Every time I emailed, I got a different person, with a different story.  Ethan said the labs would be $105 and that they would send the correct lab order.  They didn't send it, so I emailed them again and Allison said I would be billed the full rate, because of the form.  When I lost trust in them and asked for a refund, they connected me with a """"Team Lead"""" named Janet, who said they could bill my credit card and send another lab form.  I got tired of the headache and gave up.  I don't even see any available appointments for Dr. Anderson in the near future anyway.  They don't offer encrypted emails, which is another thing the doctor failed to mention.  In the end, it was $99 down the drain and I still don't know if I'm okay or not."
466		Their office staff doesn't even understand how insurance claims work. They don't care to either. This place isn't worth the hassle. Don't use this provider unless you want to spend two months going back and forth about how they are in capable of filing an insurance claim.I used them three times. The first two times I had no real issues. The doctors are fine. The third time they suddenly forgot how to properly make an insurance claim. I would expect someone to make the effort get on the phone with the carrier and have them walk them through the correct procedure if they don't know how to do their job correctly. Nope, instead they just give up and say they don't know. Their solution is to shift the burden to me so they don't have to deal with it. I constantly have to follow up with them. They just don't make the effort.

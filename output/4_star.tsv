7		Please be AWARE of recurring monthly charges! I take responsibility for not reading the fine print and only realizing after their second charge for 15 dollars in 2 months. My appointment was easy and I got a prescription I needed at the time. I didn’t even ask them to make it right and they did. I’ve come back to edit and give more stars because I really am impressed at this.
194		very fast and to the point. Medicine dosage seemed a little off but besides that they are great
228		Doctor was prompt.  Listened and came up with solution.  The only thing is that the dates on my excuse was more than we discussed.  I called to have it corrected.  It took until the next day to have it corrected.
300		i Rated a 4 due to there were appointment time slots that were listed but once you click on the time the time slot wasn’t available and I also feel the cost of the office visit was too expensive during a pandemic for an online appointment.  I also sent the attending HCP a follow up message there was no need for a follow up visit but I still received multiple messages from a different HCP regarding a follow up appointment.
301		doctor was great... but been waiting on my doctor note since my appointment,  Lazeal Moore.... what was early today at 2.00 pm ctd.?
401		Very good appointment. ONLY issue was that I was told by an admin that a certain med specifically could be prescribed, and then it could not due to state law, so I paid $100 NOT to get the medicine (after I checked PRIOR TO THE APPT). Very angering, but not the fault of the Dr. who was kind and tried his best to accommodate me.
408		My PlushCare experience was really impressive. I was very pleased with the doctor, and the overall experience. The only qualm I have is I would have preferred to chose which lab to have had my tests sent to. Apparently PlushCare has some kind of contract with Quest, who will not disclose the full cost of the test until after it is completed and you receive a “surprise” bill in the mail. As an uninsured person, I pay cash up front for my services. I prefer another lab in my city who will disclose the full test cost.
433		Quick and efficient service! My doctor was knowledgeable and caring.
518		This is great service, very convenient,  Doctors are extremely inquisitive and polite. The only problem is both times  I've used this service, there are video problems, and my insurance covers that service. I was told it was androids only. Otherwise great experience.
519		My GP was unavailable for a few days and didn't want to sit at urgent care all evening in a room full of sick people. I made an appt to have the doctor call me at my convenience and found a pharmacy with late hours.  Doctor called me on time, looked at the photos I submitted. She asked relevant questions and I was done in about 20 mins.  Super easy!  The only thing preventing me from doing this all the time is the cost but I would definitely do it again and recommend this to my friends and family.
521		"I've had two contacts with Plushcare: the first was very good without any drama. The second was filled with drama & a lack of empathy...Dr. Mary even went as far as saying, """"We cannot keep filling your prescription without you seeing a Doctor...Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, but I believe that is the population Pulse is designed to serve, people with no insurance or needing a prescription filled bc they can't make it to their Doctor. Dr. MARY, also declared that she would only approve ONE MONTH (bc she's God on a dog) of my prescription medications. I stood firm, bc I knew the mandate or policy states that Pulse is allowed to grant three months supply of medication with each call. Dr. Mary seemed to be an angry woman, bc she lectured me about not having insurance...not accepting that I was recently divorced & my ex was providing my insurance & even after explaining that she was  inpatient, as if she was blaming me for calling Pulse. I felt like saying, excuse me for bothering U, your hiness!!! But I couldn't bc I needed my meds for high blood pressure...The good news: The Wizard of Pulse aka the CEO called after I noted my concern & I explained how inappropriate Dr. Mary was & he made everything ALRIGHT...THX PULSE...I'm very pleased with Pulse bc it is very convenient & the service saved me & lots of people a lot of money...even thinking about going to Mexico was horrifying...I'm glad I stumbled upon Pulse...thx for bridging my insurance gap...and the CEO informed me that Pulse is now accepting insurance...thx!!!"
598		Did I get an accurate diagnosis and treatment?  Kind of hard to say as I got better but remained ill well after my antibiotics were complete but I was a pretty sick guy.  I did eventually fully recover after going into my regular physician and getting some steroids and an inhaler to speed up the healing process of the symptoms.  I have reservations about whether a video call allows an accurate diagnosis but I very much was not in a position to go into urgent care, which would have only allowed me a nurse practitioner, and my regular physician could not see me for a few days and in the same situation, I would try PlushCare again.  Everyone from the call-in person collecting my information to the MD who helped me was wonderful in their professionalism and prompt service.  Collecting my insurance information was easy as well as getting the appointment.  Definitely worth another try in the right situation.
635		This is a great service for minor illnesses that would otherwise require sitting in waiting rooms of urgent care or ER  facilities.  I have used them twice and both times I have been very satisfied.  While they do accept several insurances,  they don't yet accept Medicare.  I'm hoping that changes.   Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars for their superb service.
642		Very easy to schedule and my doctor was pretty good with no hassle of going to Dr clinic
